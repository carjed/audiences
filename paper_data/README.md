# Supplementary Data for the paper “Quantifying and contextualizing the impact of bioRxiv preprints through automated social media audience segmentation”


## S1_Data.xlsx
This file contains underlying data (Twitter IDs and the inferred audience sector breakdown for each user) for the audience segmentations of each of the 4 preprints displayed in Fig 1, with data for each preprint in a separate sheet.

## S2_Data.txt
This file contains summary data and metadata (title, DOI, date posted, bioRxiv category, Altmetric’s estimated academic audience fraction, our estimated academic audience fraction, fractions of users exceeding the 2%, 5%, 10%, and 20% extremist network homophily thresholds, number of tweets analyzed, Altmetric score, number of citations in mainstream media, number of citations in the academic literature) for the 1,800 preprints analyzed. Information for each preprint is replicated across 12 rows (1 per audience sector), with additional columns indicating the topic number and top 30 keywords and fraction of audience associated with that topic. These data underlie Figs 1-4, Table 1, and Supplementary Figs S1-S6.
