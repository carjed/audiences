          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Safety and Tolerability of Bacteriophage Therapy in Severe Staphylococcus aureus Infection, bioRxiv, 2019-04-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractImportanceThe effect of IV administration of a bacteriophage cocktail produced under GMP conditions on patients with severe S. aureus infection, including complicated bacteraemia, endocarditis and septic shock, is unknown.ObjectiveTo assess safety and tolerability of adjunctive bacteriophage therapy in patients with severe S. aureus infections.Design, Setting, ParticipantsObservational, open-label clinical trial of thirteen critically-ill patients admitted to a tertiary-referral hospital with S. aureus bacteraemia (including infective endocarditis, n=6) were assessed by the treating clinician and two consulting infectious diseases physicians to independently verify that routine medical and surgical therapy was optimal and that a poor outcome remained likely. Compassionate access to therapy was approved by both US and Australian regulators and by the Westmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee.InterventionA GMP-quality preparation of three combined Myoviridae bacteriophages with specific activity against S. aureus (AB-SA01), was administered intravenously in conjunction with optimal antibiotic therapy.Main Outcome and MeasurementsPhysiological, haematological and biochemical markers of infection, bacterial and bacteriophage kinetics in blood, development of resistance to bacteriophages, and mortality at 28 (D28) and 90 (D90) days were measured. Main outcomes were safety and tolerability.ResultsBacteriophage therapy was initiated 4-10 days after antibiotic commencement, at 109 plaque-forming units (PFU) twice daily. Infecting staphylococci were typical of common local subtypes. Initial input ratio of phages to bacteria in the bloodstream (MOIinput) was &amp;gt;100. Five of the thirteen patients died by D28 and a sixth patient suffered sudden cardiac death on D90. Bacteriophage therapy coincided with a marked reduction in staphylococcal bacterial DNA in the blood and in sepsis-associated inflammatory responses in almost all cases. No bacteriophage-attributable adverse events were identified. Development of bacteriophage resistance was not observed. Population analysis revealed no significant effect of bacteriophage therapy on the gut microflora.Conclusions and RelevanceAdjunctive bacteriophage therapy appears to be safe and well-tolerated in critically ill patients with severe S. aureus infection. Two weeks of twice daily intravenous administration may be a suitable protocol. Controlled trials are needed.Trial RegistrationWestmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee approval July 11, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=clintrialgov xlinkhref=NCT03395769&gt;NCT03395769&lt;jatsext-link&gt;, AB-SA01-EAP01 (January 10, 2018); Clinical Trials Notification (Australian Therapeutic Goods Association) CT-2018-CTN-02372-1 (July 23, 2018).Key PointsQuestionIs intravenous (IV) administration of investigational bacteriophage (phage) therapy safe and well-tolerated in patients with severe Staphylococcus aureus infection?FindingsThirteen patients with severe S. aureus infections received AB-SA01, a bacteriophage product prepared according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics. AB-SA01 was well-tolerated with no adverse events identified. Bacterial burden and inflammatory responses were reduced and no phage-resistant staphylococci were isolated during or after therapy.MeaningOur results will inform future randomised controlled trials assessing the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential of bacteriophages in the treatment of severe S. aureus infection.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTOBJECTIVEStudies on long-term sustainability of low-carbohydrate approaches to treat diabetes are limited. We aim to assess the effects of a continuous care intervention (CCI) on retention, glycemic control, weight, body composition, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, thyroid, inflammatory markers, diabetes medication usage and disease outcomes at 2 years in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAn open label, non-randomized, controlled study with 262 and 87 participants with T2D were enrolled in the CCI and usual care (UC) groups, respectively.RESULTSSignificant changes from baseline to 2 years in the CCI group included HbA1c (−12% from 7.7±0.1%); fasting glucose (−18% from 163.67±3.90 mgdL); fasting insulin (−42% from 27.73±1.26 pmol L-1); weight (−10% from 114.56±0.60 kg); systolic blood pressure (−4% from 131.7±0.9 mmHg); diastolic blood pressure (−4% from 81.8±0.5 mmHg); triglycerides (−22% from 197.2±9.1 mgdL); HDL-C (&#43;19% from 41.8±0.9 mgdL), and liver alanine transaminase (−21% from 29.16±0.97 UL). Spine bone mineral density in the CCI group was unchanged. Glycemic control medication use (excluding metformin) among CCI participants declined (from 56.9% to 26.8%, P=1.3×10-11) including prescribed insulin (−62%) and sulfonylureas (−100%). The UC group had no significant changes in these parameters (except uric acid and anion gap) or diabetes medication use. There was also significant resolution of diabetes (reversal, 53.5%; remission, 17.6%) in the CCI group but not in UC. All the reported improvements had p-values &amp;lt;0.00012.CONCLUSIONSThe CCI sustained long-term beneficial effects on multiple clinical markers of diabetes and cardiometabolic health at 2 years while utilizing less medication. The intervention was also effective in the resolution of diabetes and visceral obesity, with no adverse effect on bone health.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicaltrials.gov &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=clintrialgov xlinkhref=NCT02519309&gt;NCT02519309&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Correction of the Framingham Risk Score Data Reported in SPRINT, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19</h4>
          <p>This report describes an error in the Framingham Risk Score data presented in the original SPRINT publication.1 The data, presented in Table 1 of the main SPRINT publication in the New England Journal of Medicine and made available to SPRINT Challenge participants, incorrectly calculated the level of baseline cardiovascular risk of the study participants using the Framingham Risk Score. The correct calculation increased the number of participants identified as having &amp;gt;15% 10-year risk from 5737 to 7089, a change from 61% to 76% of the total study population. This information is important for researchers attempting to validate and extend the trial’s findings and is particularly germane because the recently released American Heart AssociationAmerican College of Cardiology blood pressure guidelines changed blood pressure targets for pharmacologic therapy only for high-risk individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A randomized placebo-controlled trial on the antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression, bioRxiv, 2017-01-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent open label trials show that psychedelics, such as ayahuasca, hold promise as fast-onset antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. In order to further test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel-arm, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression. Patients received a single dose of either ayahuasca or placebo. Changes in depression severity were assessed with the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D). Assessments were made at baseline, and at one (D1), two (D2) and seven (D7) days after dosing. We observed significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca when compared to placebo at all timepoints. MADRS scores were significantly lower in the ayahuasca group compared to placebo (at D1 and D2 p=0.04; and at D7 p&amp;lt;0.0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1 Cohen’ s d=0.84; D2 Cohen’ s d=0.84; D7 Cohen’ s d=1.49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and significantly higher in the ayahuasca group at D7 (64% vs. 27%; p=0.04), while remission rate was marginally significant at D7 (36% vs. 7%, p=0.054). To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to test a psychedelic substance in treatment-resistant depression. Overall, this study brings new evidence supporting the safety and therapeutic value of ayahuasca, dosed within an appropriate setting, to help treat depression.</p>
