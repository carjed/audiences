          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Geometry of the sample frequency spectrum and the perils of demographic inference, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe sample frequency spectrum (SFS), which describes the distribution of mutant alleles in a sample of DNA sequences, is a widely used summary statistic in population genetics. The expected SFS has a strong dependence on the historical population demography and this property is exploited by popular statistical methods to infer complex demographic histories from DNA sequence data. Most, if not all, of these inference methods exhibit pathological behavior, however. Specifically, they often display runaway behavior in optimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations can degenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of the inferred demography to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is to provide theoretical insights into why such problems arise. To this end, we characterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementioned pathological behavior of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometry of the expected SFS. We provide explicit descriptions and visualizations for a toy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition to arbitrary sample sizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop a universal characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sample of size n under an arbitrary population history can be recapitulated by a piecewise-constant demography with only κn epochs, where κn is between n2 and 2n – 1. The set of expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographies with fewer than κn epochs is open and non-convex, which causes the above phenomena for inference from data.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe changes in gene content that preceded the origin of animals can be reconstructed by comparison with their sister group, the choanoflagellates. However, only two choanoflagellate genomes are currently available, providing poor coverage of their diversity. We sequenced transcriptomes of 19 additional choanoflagellate species to produce a comprehensive reconstruction of the gains and losses that shaped the ancestral animal gene repertoire. We find roughly 1,700 gene families with origins on the animal stem lineage, of which only a core set of 36 are conserved across animals. We find more than 350 gene families that were previously thought to be animal-specific actually evolved before the animal-choanoflagellate divergence, including Notch and Delta, Toll-like receptors, and glycosaminoglycan hydrolases that regulate animal extracellular matrix (ECM). In the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca helianthica, we show that a glycosaminoglycan hydrolase modulates rosette colony size, suggesting a link between ECM regulation and morphogenesis in choanoflagellates and animals.Data AvailabilityRaw sequencing reads NCBI BioProject PRJNA419411 (19 choanoflagellate transcriptomes), PRJNA420352 (S. rosetta polyA selection test)Transcriptome assemblies, annotations, and gene families &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsdx.doi.org10.6084m9.figshare.5686984&gt;httpsdx.doi.org10.6084m9.figshare.5686984&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Protocols &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsdx.doi.org10.17504protocols.io.kwscxee&gt;httpsdx.doi.org10.17504protocols.io.kwscxee&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rethinking phylogenetic comparative methods, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06</h4>
          <p>As a result of the process of descent with modification, closely related species tend to be similar to one another in a myriad different ways. In statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against --- unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term phylogenetic natural history) to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what evidence supports our claims.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phylogenomics places orphan protistan lineages in a novel eukaryotic super-group, bioRxiv, 2017-12-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent phylogenetic analyses position certain ‘orphan’ protist lineages deep in the tree of eukaryotic life, but their exact placements are poorly resolved. We conducted phylogenomic analyses that incorporate deeply sequenced transcriptomes from representatives of collodictyonids (diphylleids), rigifilids, Mantamonas and ancyromonads (planomonads). Analyses of 351 genes, using site-heterogeneous mixture models, strongly support a novel supergroup-level clade that includes collodictyonids, rigifilids and Mantamonas, which we name ‘CRuMs’. Further, they robustly place CRuMs as the closest branch to Amorphea (including animals and fungi). Ancyromonads are strongly inferred to be more distantly related to Amorphea than are CRuMs. They emerge either as sister to malawimonads, or as a separate deeper branch. CRuMs and ancyromonads represent two distinct major groups that branch deeply on the lineage that includes animals, near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree. This makes both groups crucial in examinations of the deepest-level history of extant eukaryotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Model-based detection and analysis of introgressed Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, bioRxiv, 2017-12-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenetic evidence has revealed that the ancestors of modern human populations outside of Africa and their hominin sister groups, notably the Neanderthals, exchanged genetic material in the past. The distribution of these introgressed sequence-tracts along modern-day human genomes provides insight into the ancient structure and migration patterns of these archaic populations. Furthermore, it facilitates studying the selective processes that lead to the accumulation or depletion of introgressed genetic variation. Recent studies have developed methods to localize these introgressed regions, reporting long regions that are depleted of Neanderthal introgression and enriched in genes, suggesting negative selection against the Neanderthal variants. On the other hand, enriched Neanderthal ancestry in hair- and skin-related genes suggests that some introgressed variants facilitated adaptation to new environments. Here, we present a model-based method called diCal-admix and apply it to detect tracts of Neanderthal introgression in modern humans. We demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy through extensive simulations. We use our method to detect introgressed regions in modern human individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, using a high coverage genome from a Neanderthal individual from the Altai mountains as reference. Our introgression detection results and findings concerning their functional implications are largely concordant with previous studies, and are consistent with weak selection against Neanderthal ancestry. We find some evidence that selection against Neanderthal ancestry was due to higher genetic load in Neanderthals, resulting from small effective population size, rather than Dobzhansky-Müller incompatibilities. Finally, we investigate the role of the X-chromosome in the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts, bioRxiv, 2017-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractGut microbiota are shaped by a combination of ecological and evolutionary forces. While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in ∼30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over ∼6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.</p>
