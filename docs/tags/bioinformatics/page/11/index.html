          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probabilistic cell type assignment of single-cell transcriptomic data reveals spatiotemporal microenvironment dynamics in human cancers Supplementary tables, bioRxiv, 2019-01-16</h4>
          <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed biomedical research, enabling decomposition of complex tissues into disaggregated, functionally distinct cell types. For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via mapping procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects. We demonstrate the analytical advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and exemplify real-world utility to profile the spatial dynamics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the temporal dynamics of follicular lymphoma. Our analysis reveals subclonal malignant phenotypes and points towards an evolutionary interplay between immune and cancer cell populations with cancer cells escaping immune recognition.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fast and accurate reference-guided scaffolding of draft genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14</h4>
          <p>Background As the number of new genome assemblies continues to grow, there is increasing demand for methods to coalesce contigs from draft assemblies into pseudomolecules. Most current methods use genetic maps, optical maps, chromatin conformation (Hi-C), or other long-range linking data, however these data are expensive and analysis methods often fail to accurately order and orient a high percentage of assembly contigs. Other approaches utilize alignments to a reference genome for ordering and orienting, however these tools rely on slow aligners and are not robust to repetitive contigs.Results We present RaGOO, an open-source reference-guided contig ordering and orienting tool that leverages the speed and sensitivity of Minimap2 to accurately achieve chromosome-scale assemblies in just minutes. With the pseudomolecules constructed, RaGOO identifies structural variants, including those spanning sequencing gaps that are not reported by alternative methods. We show that RaGOO accurately orders and orients contigs into nearly complete chromosomes based on de novo assemblies of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing from three wild and domesticated tomato genotypes, including the widely used M82 reference cultivar. We then demonstrate the scalability and utility of RaGOO with a pan-genome analysis of 103 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions by examining the structural variants detected in the newly assembled pseudomolecules. RaGOO is available open-source with an MIT license at httpsgithub.commalongeRaGOO.Conclusions We demonstrate that with a highly contiguous assembly and a structurally accurate reference genome, reference-guided scaffolding with RaGOO outperforms error-prone reference-free methods and enable rapid pan-genome analysis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep neural networks for interpreting RNA binding protein target preferences, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>Deep learning has become a powerful paradigm to analyze the binding sites of regulatory factors including RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), owing to its strength to learn complex features from possibly multiple sources of raw data. However, the interpretability of these models, which is crucial to improve our understanding of RBP binding preferences and functions, has not yet been investigated in significant detail. We have designed a multitask and multimodal deep neural network for characterizing in vivo RBP binding preferences. The model incorporates not only the sequence but also the region type of the binding sites as input, which helps the model to boost the prediction performance. To interpret the model, we quantified the contribution of the input features to the predictive score of each RBP. Learning across multiple RBPs at once, we are able to avoid experimental biases and to identify the RNA sequence motifs and transcript context patterns that are the most important for the predictions of each individual RBP. Our findings are consistent with known motifs and binding behaviors of RBPs and can provide new insights about the regulatory functions of RBPs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">GToTree a user-friendly workflow for phylogenomics, bioRxiv, 2019-01-06</h4>
          <p>Genome-level evolutionary inference (i.e., phylogenomics) is becoming an increasingly essential step in many biologists&#39; work - such as in the characterization of newly recovered genomes, or in leveraging available reference genomes to guide evolutionary questions. Accordingly, there are several tools available for the major steps in a phylogenomics workflow. But for the biologist whose main focus is not bioinformatics, much of the computational work required - such as accessing genomic data on large scales, integrating genomes from different file formats, performing required filtering, stitching different tools together, etc. - can be prohibitive. Here I introduce GToTree, a command-line tool that can take any combination of fasta files, GenBank files, andor NCBI assembly accessions as input and outputs an alignment file, estimates of genome completeness and redundancy, and a phylogenomic tree based on the specified single-copy gene (SCG) set. While GToTree can work with any custom hidden Markov Models (HMMs), also included are 13 newly generated SCG-set HMMs for different lineages and levels of resolution, built based on searches of ~12,000 bacterial and archaeal high-quality genomes. GToTree aims to give more researchers the capability to make phylogenomic trees.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A pitfall for machine learning methods aiming to predict across cell types, bioRxiv, 2019-01-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractMachine learning models used to predict phenomena such as gene expression, enhancer activity, transcription factor binding, or chromatin conformation are most useful when they can generalize to make accurate predictions across cell types. In this situation, a natural strategy is to train the model on experimental data from some cell types and evaluate performance on one or more held-out cell types. In this work, we show that when the training set contains examples derived from the same genomic loci across multiple cell types, the resulting model can be susceptible to a particular form of bias related to memorizing the average activity associated with each genomic locus. Consequently, the trained model may appear to perform well when evaluated on the genomic loci that it was trained on but tends to perform poorly on loci that it was not trained on. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using epigenomic measurements and nucleotide sequence to predict gene expression and chromatin domain boundaries, and we suggest methods to diagnose and avoid the pitfall. We anticipate that, as more data and computing resources become available, future projects will increasingly risk suffering from this issue.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Human microbiome aging clocks based on deep learning and tandem of permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects, bioRxiv, 2018-12-29</h4>
          <p>The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected by its host status. Previous analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host health and disease status, genotype and diet. Here, we developed a method of predicting the biological age of the host based on the microbiological profiles of gut microbiota using a curated dataset of 1,165 healthy individuals (1,663 microbiome samples). Our predictive model, a human microbiome clock, has an architecture of a deep neural network and achieves the accuracy of 3.94 years mean absolute error in cross-validation. The performance of the deep microbiome clock was also evaluated on several additional populations. We further introduce a platform for biological interpretation of individual microbial features used in age models, which relies on permutation feature importance and accumulated local effects. This approach has allowed us to define two lists of 95 intestinal biomarkers of human aging. We further show that this list can be reduced to 39 taxa that convey the most information on their host&#39;s aging. Overall, we show that (a) microbiological profiles can be used to predict human age; and (b) microbial features selected by models are age-related.</p>
