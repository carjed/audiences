          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fast, sensitive, and accurate integration of single cell data with Harmony, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe rapidly emerging diversity of single cell RNAseq datasets allows us to characterize the transcriptional behavior of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of ∼ 106 cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes. Harmony is a fast and flexible general purpose integration algorithm that enables the identification of shared fine-grained subpopulations across a variety of experimental and biological conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Valid post-clustering differential analysis for single-cell RNA-Seq, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>SummarySingle-cell computational pipelines involve two critical steps organizing cells (clustering) and identifying the markers driving this organization (differential expression analysis). State-of-the-art pipelines perform differential analysis after clustering on the same dataset. We observe that because clustering forces separation, reusing the same dataset generates artificially low p-values and hence false discoveries. We introduce a valid post-clustering differential analysis framework which corrects for this problem.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A practical guide to methods controlling false discoveries in computational biology, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Personalized and graph genomes reveal missing signal in epigenomic data, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundEpigenomic studies that use next generation sequencing experiments typically rely on the alignment of reads to a reference sequence. However, because of genetic diversity and the diploid nature of the human genome, we hypothesized that using a generic reference could lead to incorrectly mapped reads and bias downstream results.ResultsWe show that accounting for genetic variation using a modified reference genome (MPG) or a denovo assembled genome (DPG) can alter histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak calls by either creating new personal peaks or by the loss of reference peaks. MPGs are found to alter approximately 1% of peak calls while DPGs alter up to 5% of peaks. We also show statistically significant differences in the amount of reads observed in regions associated with the new, altered and unchanged peaks. We report that short insertions and deletions (indels), followed by single nucleotide variants (SNVs), have the highest probability of modifying peak calls. A counter-balancing factor is peak width, with wider calls being less likely to be altered. Next, because high-quality DPGs remain hard to obtain, we show that using a graph personalized genome (GPG), represents a reasonable compromise between MPGs and DPGs and alters about 2.5% of peak calls. Finally, we demonstrate that altered peaks have a genomic distribution typical of other peaks. For instance, for H3K4me1, 518 personal-only peaks were replicated using at least two of three approaches, 394 of which were inside or within 10Kb of a gene.ConclusionsAnalysing epigenomic datasets with personalized and graph genomes allows the recovery of new peaks enriched for indels and SNVs. These altered peaks are more likely to differ between individuals and, as such, could be relevant in the study of various human phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics improves data denoising and pattern discovery, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have shed light on the role of cellular diversity in human pathophysiology1–3, the resulting data remains noisy and sparse, making reliable quantification of gene expression challenging. Here, we show that a deep autoencoder coupled to a Bayesian model remarkably improves UMI-based scRNA-seq data quality by transfer learning across datasets. This new technology, SAVER-X, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The deep learning model in SAVER-X extracts transferable gene expression features across data from different labs, generated by varying technologies, and obtained from divergent species. Through this framework, we explore the limits of transfer learning in a diverse testbed and demonstrate that future human sequencing projects will unequivocally benefit from the accumulation of publicly available data. We further show, through examples in immunology and neurodevelopment, that SAVER-X can harness existing public data to enhance downstream analysis of new data, such as those collected in clinical settings.</p>
