          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bias, robustness and scalability in differential expression analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data, bioRxiv, 2017-05-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundAs single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is becoming increasingly common, the amount of publicly available data grows rapidly, generating a useful resource for computational method development and extension of published results. Although processed data matrices are typically made available in public repositories, the procedure to obtain these varies widely between data sets, which may complicate reuse and cross-data set comparison. Moreover, while many statistical methods for performing differential expression analysis of scRNA-seq data are becoming available, their relative merits and the performance compared to methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data are not sufficiently well understood.ResultsWe present conquer, a collection of consistently processed, analysis-ready public single-cell RNA-seq data sets. Each data set has count and transcripts per million (TPM) estimates for genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. We use a subset of the data sets available in conquer to perform an extensive evaluation of the performance and characteristics of statistical methods for differential gene expression analysis, evaluating a total of 30 statistical approaches on both experimental and simulated scRNA-seq data.ConclusionsConsiderable differences are found between the methods in terms of the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Pre-filtering of lowly expressed genes can have important effects on the results, particularly for some of the methods originally developed for analysis of bulk RNA-seq data. Generally, however, methods developed for bulk RNA-seq analysis do not perform notably worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine, bioRxiv, 2017-05-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractDeep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">scImpute Accurate And Robust Imputation For Single Cell RNA-Seq Data, bioRxiv, 2017-05-25</h4>
          <p>The emerging single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the investigation of transcriptomic landscapes at single-cell resolution. The analysis of scRNA-seq data is complicated by excess zero or near zero counts, the so-called dropouts due to the low amounts of mRNA sequenced within individual cells. Downstream analysis of scRNA-seq would be severely biased if the dropout events are not properly corrected. We introduce scImpute, a statistical method to accurately and robustly impute the dropout values in scRNA-seq data. ScImpute automatically identifies gene expression values affected by dropout events, and only perform imputation on these values without introducing new bias to the rest data. ScImpute also detects outlier or rare cells and excludes them from imputation. Evaluation based on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data on mouse embryos, mouse brain cells, human blood cells, and human embryonic stem cells suggests that scImpute is an effective tool to recover transcriptome dynamics masked by dropout events. scImpute is shown to correct false zero counts, enhance the clustering of cell populations and subpopulations, improve the accuracy of differential expression analysis, and aid the study of gene expression dynamics.</p>

          <p>1AbstractWe found tremendous inequality across gene and protein annotation resources. We observe that this bias leads biomedical researchers to focus on richly annotated genes instead of those with the strongest molecular data. We advocate for researchers to reduce these biases by pursuing data-driven hypotheses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Strain-resolved microbiome sequencing reveals mobile elements that drive bacterial competition on a clinical timescale, bioRxiv, 2017-04-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlthough shotgun short-read sequencing has facilitated the study of strain-level architecture within complex microbial communities, existing metagenomic approaches often cannot capture structural differences between closely related co-occurring strains. Recent methods, which employ read cloud sequencing and specialized assembly techniques, provide significantly improved genome drafts and show potential to capture these strain-level differences. Here, we apply this read cloud metagenomic approach to longitudinal stool samples from a patient undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. The patient’s microbiome is profoundly disrupted and is eventually dominated by Bacteroides caccae. Comparative analysis of B. caccae genomes obtained using read cloud sequencing together with metagenomic RNA sequencing allows us to predict that particular mobile element integrations result in increased antibiotic resistance, which we further support using in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. Thus, we find read cloud sequencing to be useful in identifying strain-level differences that underlie differential fitness.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Machine Learning-based state-of-the-art methods for the classification of RNA-Seq data, bioRxiv, 2017-03-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractRNA-Seq measures expression levels of several transcripts simultaneously. The identified reads can be gene, exon, or other region of interest. Various computational tools have been developed for studying pathogen or virus from RNA-Seq data by classifying them according to the attributes in several predefined classes, but still computational tools and approaches to analyze complex datasets are still lacking. The development of classification models is highly recommended for disease diagnosis and classification, disease monitoring at molecular level as well as researching for potential disease biomarkers. In this chapter, we are going to discuss various machine learning approaches for RNA-Seq data classification and their implementation. Advancements in bioinformatics, along with developments in machine learning based classification, would provide powerful toolboxes for classifying transcriptome information available through RNA-Seq data.</p>
