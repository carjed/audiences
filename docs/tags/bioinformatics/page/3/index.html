          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The advantages and disadvantages of short- and long-read metagenomics to infer bacterial and eukaryotic community composition, bioRxiv, 2019-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundThe first step in understanding ecological community diversity and dynamics is quantifying community membership. An increasingly common method for doing so is through metagenomics. Because of the rapidly increasing popularity of this approach, a large number of computational tools and pipelines are available for analysing metagenomic data. However, the majority of these tools have been designed and benchmarked using highly accurate short read data (i.e. illumina), with few studies benchmarking classification accuracy for long error-prone reads (PacBio or Oxford Nanopore). In addition, few tools have been benchmarked for non-microbial communities.ResultsHere we use simulated error prone Oxford Nanopore and high accuracy Illumina read sets to systematically investigate the effects of sequence length and taxon type on classification accuracy for metagenomic data from both microbial and non-microbial communities. We show that very generally, classification accuracy is far lower for non-microbial communities, even at low taxonomic resolution (e.g. family rather than genus).ConclusionsWe then show that for two popular taxonomic classifiers, long error-prone reads can significantly increase classification accuracy, and this is most pronounced for non-microbial communities. This work provides insight on the expected accuracy for metagenomic analyses for different taxonomic groups, and establishes the point at which read length becomes more important than error rate for assigning the correct taxon.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Algorithms for efficiently collapsing reads with Unique Molecular Identifiers, bioRxiv, 2019-05-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundUnique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) are used in many experiments to find and remove PCR duplicates. Although there are many tools for solving the problem of deduplicating reads based on their finding reads with the same alignment coordinates and UMIs, many tools either cannot handle substitution errors, or require expensive pairwise UMI comparisons that do not efficiently scale to larger datasets.ResultsWe formulate the problem of deduplicating UMIs in a manner that enables optimizations to be made, and more efficient data structures to be used. We implement our data structures and optimizations in a tool called UMICollapse, which is able to deduplicate over one million unique UMIs of length 9 at a single alignment position in around 26 seconds.ConclusionsWe present a new formulation of the UMI deduplication problem, and show that it can be solved faster, with more sophisticated data structures.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTEpigenetic single-cell measurements reveal a layer of regulatory information not accessible to single-cell transcriptomics, however single-cell-omics analysis tools mainly focus on gene expression data. To address this issue, we present epiScanpy, a computational framework for the analysis of single-cell DNA methylation and single-cell ATAC-seq data. EpiScanpy makes the many existing RNA-seq workflows from scanpy available to large-scale single-cell data from other -omics modalities. We introduce and compare multiple feature space constructions for epigenetic data and show the feasibility of common clustering, dimension reduction and trajectory learning techniques. We benchmark epiScanpy by interrogating different single-cell brain mouse atlases of DNA methylation, ATAC-seq and transcriptomics. We find that differentially methylated and differentially open markers between cell clusters enrich transcriptome-based cell type labels by orthogonal epigenetic information.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Novel Rhabdovirus and an almost complete drain fly transcriptome recovered from two independent contaminations of clinical samples, bioRxiv, 2019-05-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractMetagenomic approaches enable an open exploration of microbial communities without requiring a priori knowledge of a sampleâ€™s composition by shotgun sequencing the total RNA or DNA of the sample. Such an approach is valuable for exploratory diagnostics of novel pathogens in clinical practice. Yet, one may also identify surprising off-target findings. Here we report a mostly complete transcriptome from a drain fly (likely Psychoda alternata) as well as a novel Rhabdovirus-like virus recovered from two independent contaminations of RNA sequencing libraries from clinical samples of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and serum, out of a total of 724 libraries sequenced at the same laboratory during a 2-year time span. This drain fly genome shows a considerable divergence from previously sequenced insects, which may obscure common clinical metagenomic analyses not expecting such contaminations. The classification of these contaminant sequences allowed us to identify infected drain flies as the likely origin of the novel Rhabdovirus-like sequence, which could have been erroneously linked to human pathology, had they been ignored.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Benchmarking algorithms for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell gene expression data. We develop a systematic framework called BEELINE for this purpose. We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative GRN inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining GRN inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of GRN inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them. BEELINE, which is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpgithub.commurali-groupBEELINE&gt;httpgithub.commurali-groupBEELINE&lt;jatsext-link&gt; under an open-source license, will aid in the future development of GRN inference algorithms for single-cell transcriptomic data.</p>

          <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, the computation consumes a long time and large memory space. In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-efficient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq dataset. Our benchmark showed that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-efficient, and accurate than the other algorithms. Considering the difference of computational environment of users and developers, we also developed the guideline to select the appropriate PCA implementations.</p>
