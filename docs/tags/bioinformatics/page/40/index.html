          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nucleotide sequence and DNaseI sensitivity are predictive of 3D chromatin architecture, bioRxiv, 2017-01-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecently, Hi-C has been used to probe the 3D chromatin architecture of multiple organisms and cell types. The resulting collections of pairwise contacts across the genome have connected chromatin architecture to many cellular phenomena, including replication timing and gene regulation. However, high resolution (10 kb or finer) contact maps remain scarce due to the expense and time required for collection. A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. We describe Rambutan, a deep convolutional neural network that predicts Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. Specifically, Rambutan identifies locus pairs that engage in high confidence contacts according to Fit-Hi-C, a previously described method for assigning statistical confidence estimates to Hi-C contacts. We first demonstrate Rambutan’s performance across chromosomes at 1 kb resolution in the GM12878 cell line. Subsequently, we measure Rambutan’s performance across six cell types. In this setting, the model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7662 and 0.8246 and an area under the precision-recall curve between 0.3737 and 0.9008. We further demonstrate that the predicted contacts exhibit expected trends relative to histone modification ChlP-seq data, replication timing measurements, and annotations of functional elements such as promoters and enhancers. Finally, we predict Hi-C contacts for 53 human cell types and show that the predictions cluster by cellular function. [NOTE After our original submission we discovered an error in our calling of statistically significant contacts. Briefly, when calculating the prior probability of a contact, we used the number of contacts at a certain genomic distance in a chromosome but divided by the total number of bins in the full genome. When we corrected this mistake we noticed that the Rambutan model, as it curently stands, did not outperform simply using the GM12878 contact map that Rambutan was trained on as the predictor in other cell types. While we investigate these new results, we ask that readers treat this manuscript skeptically.]</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome Graphs, bioRxiv, 2017-01-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is increasing recognition that a single, monoploid reference genome is a poor universal reference structure for human genetics, because it represents only a tiny fraction of human variation. Adding this missing variation results in a structure that can be described as a mathematical graph a genome graph. We demonstrate that, in comparison to the existing reference genome (GRCh38), genome graphs can substantially improve the fractions of reads that map uniquely and perfectly. Furthermore, we show that this fundamental simplification of read mapping transforms the variant calling problem from one in which many non-reference variants must be discovered de-novo to one in which the vast majority of variants are simply re-identified within the graph. Using standard benchmarks as well as a novel reference-free evaluation, we show that a simplistic variant calling procedure on a genome graph can already call variants at least as well as, and in many cases better than, a state-of-the-art method on the linear human reference genome. We anticipate that graph-based references will supplant linear references in humans and in other applications where cohorts of sequenced individuals are available.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation – a benchmark of computational metagenomics software, bioRxiv, 2017-01-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn metagenome analysis, computational methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key components facilitating downstream biological data interpretation. However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from ~700 newly sequenced microorganisms and ~600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">De novo Identification of DNA Modifications Enabled by Genome-Guided Nanopore Signal Processing, bioRxiv, 2016-12-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractAdvances in nanopore sequencing technology have enabled investigation of the full catalogue of covalent DNA modifications. We present the first algorithm for the identification of modified nucleotides without the need for prior training data along with the open source software implementation, nanoraw. Nanoraw accurately assigns contiguous raw nanopore signal to genomic positions, enabling novel data visualization, and increasing power and accuracy for the discovery of covalently modified bases in native DNA. Ground truth case studies utilizing synthetically methylated DNA show the capacity to identify three distinct methylation marks, 4mC, 5mC, and 6mA, in seven distinct sequence contexts without any changes to the algorithm. We demonstrate quantitative reproducibility simultaneously identifying 5mC and 6mA in native E. coli across biological replicates processed in different labs. Finally we propose a pipeline for the comprehensive discovery of DNA modifications in any genome without a priori knowledge of their chemical identities.</p>

          <p>MotivationSingle-cell gene expression profiling technologies can map the cell states in a tissue or organism. As these technologies become more common, there is a need for computational tools to explore the data they produce. In particular, existing data visualization approaches are imperfect for studying continuous gene expression topologies.ResultsForce-directed layouts of k-nearest-neighbor graphs can visualize continuous gene expression topologies in a manner that preserves high-dimensional relationships and allows manually exploration of different stable two-dimensional representations of the same data. We implemented an interactive web-tool to visualize single-cell data using force-directed graph layouts, called SPRING. SPRING reveals more detailed biological relationships than existing approaches when applied to branching gene expression trajectories from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Visualizations from SPRING are also more reproducible than those of stochastic visualization methods such as tSNE, a state-of-the-art tool.Availability&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpskleintools.hms.harvard.edutoolsspring.html&gt;httpskleintools.hms.harvard.edutoolsspring.html&lt;jatsext-link&gt;,&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comAllonKleinLabSPRING&gt;httpsgithub.comAllonKleinLabSPRING&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Contactcalebsw@gmail.com, allon_klein@hms.harvard.edu</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Predicting Enhancer-Promoter Interaction from Genomic Sequence with Deep Neural Networks, bioRxiv, 2016-11-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the human genome, distal enhancers are involved in regulating target genes through proxi-mal promoters by forming enhancer-promoter interactions. Although recently developed high-throughput experimental approaches have allowed us to recognize potential enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide, it is still largely unclear to what extent the sequence-level information encoded in our genome help guide such interactions. Here we report a new computational method (named “SPEID”) using deep learning models to predict enhancer-promoter interactions based on sequence-based features only, when the locations of putative enhancers and promoters in a particular cell type are given. Our results across six different cell types demonstrate that SPEID is effective in predicting enhancer-promoter interactions as compared to state-of-the-art methods that only use information from a single cell type. As a proof-of-principle, we also applied SPEID to identify somatic non-coding mutations in melanoma samples that may have reduced enhancer-promoter interactions in tumor genomes. This work demonstrates that deep learning models can help reveal that sequence-based features alone are sufficient to reliably predict enhancer-promoter interactions genome-wide.</p>
