          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Absence of entourage Terpenoids commonly found in Cannabis sativa do not modulate the functional activity of Δ9-THC at human CB1and CB2 receptors, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractIntroductionCompounds present in Cannabis sativa such as phytocannabinoids and terpenoids, may act in concert to elicit therapeutic effects. Cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) directly activate cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), however, it is not known if terpenoids present in Cannabis also affect cannabinoid receptor signalling. Therefore, we examined 6 common terpenoids alone, and in combination with cannabinoid receptor agonists, on CB1 and CB2 signalling in vitro.Materials and MethodsPotassium channel activity in AtT20 FlpIn cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptors was measured in real-time using FLIPR® membrane potential dye in a FlexStation 3 plate reader. Terpenoids were tested individually and in combination for periods up to 30 minutes. Endogenous somatostatin receptors served as a control for direct effects of drugs on potassium channels.Resultsα-Pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, linalool, limonene and β-myrcene (up to 30-100 µM) did not change membrane potential in AtT20 cells expressing CB1 or CB2, or affect the response to a maximally effective concentration of the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940. The presence of individual or a combination of terpenoids did not affect the hyperpolarization produced by Δ9-THC (10µM) (CB1 control, 59±7%; with terpenoids (10 µM each) 55±4%; CB2 Δ9-THC 16±5%, with terpenoids (10 µM each) 17±4%). To investigate possible effect on desensitization of CB1 responses, all six terpenoids were added together with Δ9-THC and signalling measured continuously over 30 min. Terpenoids did not affect desensitization, after 30 minutes the control hyperpolarization recovered by 63±6%, in the presence of the terpenoids recovery was 61±5%.DiscussionNone of the six of the most common terpenoids in Cannabis directly activated CB1 or CB2, or modulated the signalling of the phytocannabinoid agonist Δ9-THC. These results suggest that if a phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effect exists, it is not at the CB1 or CB2 receptor level. It remains possible that terpenoids activate CB1 and CB2 signalling pathways that do not involve potassium channels, however, it seems more likely that they may act at different molecular target(s) in the neuronal circuits important for the behavioural effect of Cannabis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Drug screens of NGLY1 Deficiency worm and fly models reveal catecholamine, NRF2 and anti-inflammatory pathway activation as clinical approaches, bioRxiv, 2019-02-28</h4>
          <p>N-glycanase 1NGLY1 Deficiency is an ultra-rare and complex monogenic glycosylation disorder that affects fewer than 40 patients globally. NGLY1 Deficiency has been studied in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies and mice. Proteasomal and mitochondrial homeostasisgene networks are controlled by the evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator Nrf1, whose activity requires deglycosylation by NGLY1. Hypersensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a common phenotype observed in whole animal and cellular models of NGLY1Deficiency. Here we describe unbiased phenotypic drug screens to identify FDA approved drugs, generally recognized as safe natural products and novel chemical entities that rescue growth and development of NGLY1-deficient worm and fly larvae treated with a toxic dose of bortezomib. We used image-based larval size and number assays for use in screens of a 2,560-member drug repurposing library and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. A total of 91 validated hit compounds from primary invertebrate screens were tested in a human cell line in a NRF2 activity assay. NRF2 is a transcriptional regulator that regulates cellular redox homeostasis and it can compensate for loss of Nrf1. Plant-based polyphenols comprise the largest class of hit compounds and NRF2 inducers. Catecholamines and catecholamine receptor activators comprise the second largest class of hits. Steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comprise the third largest class. Only one compound was active in all assays and species the atypical antipsychotic and dopamine receptor agonist aripiprazole. Worm and fly models of NGLY1 Deficiency validate therapeutic rationales for activation of NRF2 and anti-inflammatory pathways based on results in mice and human cell models and suggest a novel therapeutic rationale for boosting catecholamine levels andor signaling in the brain.</p>
