          <p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that exhibit a complex inner architecture. They exhibit a smooth outer membrane and a highly convoluted inner membrane that forms invaginations called cristae. Imaging cristae in living cells poses a formidable challenge for light microscopy. Relying on a cell line stably expressing the mitochondrial protein Cox8A fused to the SNAP-tag and using STED (stimulated emission depletion) super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate the visualization of cristae dynamics in cultivated human cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Non-replication of functional connectivity differences in ASD a multi-site study, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractA large and rapidly growing number of studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify various alterations of functional connectivity (FC), with the hope of identifying clinically useful biomarkers or neural mechanisms underlying ASD. However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing this lack of replicability. Here, we used resting-state (rs-fMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I and II) to investigate two factors thought to strongly influence replicability the use of different denoising methods (i.e., data preprocessing) and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition parameters, etc.). Using four independently acquired datasets and 31 different denoising strategies, we examined the replicability of patterns of both group-averaged functional connectomes and group-level differences (i.e., ASD vs. control). Within datasets, both group-averages and group-comparisons of functional connectomes were highly consistent (r = 0.92 ±0.06  r = 0.80±0.09) across different pipelines, with the largest differences across pipelines reflecting whether global signal regression (GSR) was used. However, across datasets, while group-averages were still highly consistent (r = 0.86±0.02), group differences did not replicate, regardless of denoising strategy indeed, consistency of group differences was so low (r = 0.09±0.05) that differences identified in one dataset had essentially no relationship with those in other datasets. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at the network (as opposed to edge) level. Because there are a number of additional methodological factors that can influence the reliable detection of group differences (e.g., scanner-related differences, subject differences, post-processing analysis, effect sizes of ASD alterations, amount and quality of data), these results cannot completely rule out the existence of replicable resting-state FC differences in ASD. However, they do highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when describing and interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assortative mating in hybrid zones is remarkably ineffective in promoting speciation, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractAssortative mating and other forms of partial prezygotic isolation are often viewed as being more important than partial postzygotic isolation (low fitness of hybrids) early in the process of speciation. Here we simulate secondary contact between two populations (‘species’) to examine effects of pre- and postzygotic isolation in preventing blending. A small reduction in hybrid fitness (e.g., 10%) produces a narrower hybrid zone than a strong but imperfect mating preference (e.g., 10x stronger preference for conspecific over heterospecific mates). This is because, in the latter case, rare F1 hybrids find each other attractive (due to assortative mating), leading to the gradual buildup of a full continuum of intermediates between the two species. The cline is narrower than would result from purely neutral diffusion over the same number of generations, but this effect is due to the frequency-dependent mating disadvantage of individuals of rare mating types. Hybrids tend to pay this cost of rarity more than pure individuals, meaning there is an induced postzygotic isolation effect of assortative mating. When this induced mating disadvantage is removed, partial assortative mating does not prevent eventual blending of the species. These results prompt a questioning of the concept of partial prezygotic isolation, since it is not very isolating unless there is also postzygotic isolation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bayesian multivariate reanalysis of large genetic studies identifies many new associations, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now been conducted for hundreds of phenotypes of relevance to human health. Many such GWAS involve multiple closely-related phenotypes collected on the same samples. However, the vast majority of these GWAS have been analyzed using simple univariate analyses, which consider one phenotype at a time. This is de-spite the fact that, at least in simulation experiments, multivariate analyses have been shown to be more powerful at detecting associations. Here, we conduct multivariate association analyses on 13 different publicly-available GWAS datasets that involve multiple closely-related phenotypes. These data include large studies of anthropometric traits (GIANT), plasma lipid traits (GlobalLipids), and red blood cell traits (HaemgenRBC). Our analyses identify many new associations (433 in total across the 13 studies), many of which replicate when follow-up samples are available. Overall, our results demonstrate that multivariate analyses can help make more effective use of data from both existing and future GWAS.1Author SummaryGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a common and powerful tool for identifying significant correlations between markers of genetic variation and physical traits of interest. Often these studies are conducted by comparing genetic variation against single traits one at a time (‘univariate’); however, it has previously been shown that it is possible to increase your power to detect significant associations by comparing genetic variation against multiple traits simultaneously (‘multivariate’). Despite this apparent increase in power though, researchers still rarely conduct multivariate GWAS, even when studies have multiple traits readily available. Here, we reanalyze 13 previously published GWAS using a multivariate method and find &amp;gt;400 additional associations. Our method makes use of univariate GWAS summary statistics and is available as a software package, thus making it accessible to other researchers interested in conducting the same analyses. We also show, using studies that have multiple releases, that our new associations have high rates of replication. Overall, we argue multivariate approaches in GWAS should no longer be overlooked and how, often, there is low-hanging fruit in the form of new associations by running these methods on data already collected.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evidence of large genetic influences on dog ownership in the Swedish Twin Registry has implications for understanding domestication and health associations, Scientific Reports, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>Dogs were the first domesticated animal and, according to the archaeological evidence, have had a close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years. Today, dogs are common pets in our society and have been linked to increased well-being and improved health outcomes in their owners. A dog in the family during childhood is associated with ownership in adult life. The underlying factors behind this association could be related to experiences or to genetic influences. We aimed to investigate the heritability of dog ownership in a large twin sample including all twins in the Swedish Twin Registry born between 1926 and 1996 and alive in 2006. Information about dog ownership was available from 2001 to 2016 from national dog registers. The final data set included 85,542 twins from 50,507 twin pairs with known zygosity, where information on both twins were available in 35,035 pairs. Structural equation modeling was performed to estimate additive genetic effects (the heritability), commonshared environmental, and uniquenon-shared environmental effects. We found that additive genetic factors largely contributed to dog ownership, with heritability estimated at 57% for females and 51% for males. An effect of shared environmental factors was only observed in early adulthood. In conclusion, we show a strong genetic contribution to dog ownership in adulthood in a large twin study. We see two main implications of this finding (1) genetic variation may have contributed to our ability to domesticate dogs and other animals and (2) potential pleiotropic effects of genetic variation affecting dog ownership should be considered in studies examining health impacts of dog ownership.</p>

          <p>SUMMARYBreast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where each OncoOmics approach needs to be fully understood as a part of a complex network. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to analyze genetic alterations, signaling pathways, protein-protein interaction networks, protein expression, dependency maps and enrichment maps in 230 previously prioritized genes by the Consensus Strategy, the Pan-Cancer Atlas, the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase and the Cancer Genome Interpreter, in order to reveal essential genes to accelerate the development of precision medicine in BC. The OncoOmics essential genes were rationally filtered to 144, 48 (33%) of which were hallmarks of cancer and 20 (14%) were significant in at least three OncoOmics approaches RAC1, AKT1 CCND1, PIK3CA, ERBB2, CDH1, MAPK14, TP53, MAPK1, SRC, RAC3, PLCG1, GRB2, MED1, TOP2A, GATA3, BCL2, CTNNB1, EGFR and CDK2. According to the Open Targets Platform, there are 111 drugs that are currently being analyzed in 3151 clinical trials in 39 genes. Lastly, there are more than 800 clinical annotations associated with 94 genes in BC pharmacogenomics.</p>
