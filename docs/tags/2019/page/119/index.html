          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ensuring meiotic DNA break formation in the mouse pseudoautosomal region, bioRxiv, 2019-01-31</h4>
          <p>Sex chromosomes in males share only a diminutive homologous segment, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), wherein meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs), pairing, and crossing over must occur for correct segregation. How cells ensure PAR recombination is unknown. Here we delineate cis-and trans-acting factors that control PAR ultrastructure and make the PAR the hottest area of DSB formation in the male mouse genome. Prior to DSB formation, PAR chromosome axes elongate, sister chromatids separate, and DSB-promoting factors hyperaccumulate. These phenomena are linked to mo-2 minisatellite arrays and require ANKRD31 protein. We propose that the repetitive PAR sequence confers unique chromatin and higher order structures crucial for DSB formation, X–Y pairing, and recombination. Our findings establish a mechanistic paradigm of mammalian sex chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genotype-phenotype relationships in children with Copy Number Variants associated with high neuropsychiatric risk Findings from the case-control IMAGINE-ID cohort in the United Kingdom, bioRxiv, 2019-01-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundA variety of Copy Number Variants are associated with a high risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (ND-CNVs). We aimed to characterise the impact of ND-CNVs on childhood development and investigate whether different ND-CNVs lead to distinct and specific patterns of cognitive and behavioural outcomes.Methods258 children with ND-CNVs (13 CNVs across 9 loci) were systematically assessed for psychiatric disorders as well as broader traits of neurodevelopmental, cognitive and psychopathological origin. A comparison was made with 106 control siblings, in order to test the hypothesis that phenotypes would differ by genotype, both quantitatively, in terms of severity, and qualitatively in the pattern of associated impairments.Outcomes79.8% of ND-CNVs carriers met criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders (OR=13.8 compared to controls) the risk of ADHD (OR=6.9), ODD (OR=3.6), anxiety disorders (OR=2.9), and ASD traits (OR=44.1) was particularly high. ND-CNVs carriers were impaired across all neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and psychopathological traits relative to controls. Only moderate quantitative and qualitative differences in phenotypic profile were found between genotypes. In general, the range of phenotypes was broadly similar for all ND-CNV genotypes. Traits did show some evidence of genotypic specificity, however the specific genotype accounted for a low proportion of variance in outcome (5-20% depending on trait).InterpretationThe 13 ND-CNVs studied have a similar range of adverse effects on childhood neurodevelopment, despite subtle quantitative and qualitative differences. Our findings suggest that genomic risk for neuropsychiatric disorder has pleiotropic effects on multiple processes and neural circuits, and provides important implications for research into genotype-phenotype relationships within psychiatry.FundingThe Medical Research Council and the Waterloo FoundationResearch in contextEvidence before this studySeveral Copy Number Variants (CNVs) have been associated with high risk of development of child and adult neuropsychiatric disorders. Increasingly young children with developmental delay referred for genetic testing are being diagnosed with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric risk CNVs (referred to as ND-CNVs hereafter). It remains unclear whether different genotypes are associated with specific cognitive and behavioural phenotypes or whether these outcomes are non-specific. We searched PubMed for English language studies published from database inception until January 10th, 2019 that investigated the relationship between CNVs and cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Search terms included “CNV”, “genomics”, “1q21.1”, “2p16.3”, “NRXN1”, “9q34”, “Kleefstra Syndrome”, “15q11.2”, “15q13.3”, “16p11.2”, “22q11.2”, “psychiatry”, and “cognition”. Preliminary studies have indicated that deletions and duplications at the same loci may differ in cognitive and behavioural phenotypes. However, to date, there have been limited studies that contrasted the phenotypes of ND-CNVs across several loci on a range of cognitive and behavioural domains.Added value of this studyWe found that young people carrying a ND-CNV were at considerably increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorder and impairments across a range of neurodevelopmental, psychopathological, cognitive, social, sleep and motor traits. Within ND-CNV carriers, comparisons between genotypes indicated moderate quantitative and qualitative differences in overall phenotypic profile, with evidence that severity of impairment was similar across all genotypes for some traits (e.g. mood problems, sleep impairments, peer problems, and sustained attention) whereas for other traits there was evidence of genotype specific effects on severity (e.g., IQ, spatial planning, processing speed, subclinical psychotic experiences, ASD traits, motor coordination total psychiatric symptomatology, particularly anxiety, ADHD, and conduct related traits). However the proportion of variance explained by genotype was low, 5-20% depending on trait, indicating that overall ND-CNVs lead to similar neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is important that genotype-phenotype relationships are viewed through a developmental lens as some phenotypic outcomes were found to be associated with age.Implications of all the available evidenceOur work highlights that children who carry a ND-CNV represent a patient group that warrants clinical and educational attention for a broad range of cognitive and behavioural impairments and that commonalities in clinically relevant neurodevelopmental impairments exist across ND-CNVs. This group of young people could benefit from the development of a general care pathway, to which genotype-specific recommendations can be added where needed. Our work indicates that the relationship between genotype and neurodevelopmental phenotype is complex and that future research will need to take a global systems approach and not be narrowly focused on single phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distinct characteristics of genes associated with phenome-wide variation in maize (Zea mays), bioRxiv, 2019-01-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTNaturally occurring functional genetic variation is often employed to identify genetic loci that regulate specific traits. Existing approaches to link functional genetic variation to quantitative phenotypic outcomes typically evaluate one or several traits at a time. Advances in high throughput phenotyping now enable datasets which include information on dozens or hundreds of traits scored across multiple environments. Here, we develop an approach to use data from many phenotypic traits simultaneously to identify causal genetic loci. Using data for 260 traits scored across a maize diversity panel, we demonstrate that a distinct set of genes are identified relative to conventional genome wide association. The genes identified using this many-trait approach are more likely to be independently validated than the genes identified by conventional analysis of the same dataset. Genes identified by the new many-trait approach share a number of molecular, population genetic, and evolutionary features with a gold standard set of genes characterized through forward genetics. These features, as well as substantially stronger functional enrichment and purification, separate them from both genes identified by conventional genome wide association and from the overall population of annotated gene models. These results are consistent with a large subset of annotated gene models in maize playing little or no role in determining organismal phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Is it time to change the reference genome?, bioRxiv, 2019-01-30</h4>
          <p>The use of the human reference genome has shaped methods and data across modern genomics.  This has offered many benefits while creating a few constraints. In the following piece, we outline the history, properties, and pitfalls of the current human reference genome. In a few illustrative analyses, we focus on its use for variant-calling, highlighting its nearness to a type specimen. We suggest that switching to a consensus reference offers important advantages over the current reference with few disadvantages.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Constant sub-second cycling between representations of possible futures in the hippocampus, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29</h4>
          <p>Cognitive faculties such as imagination, planning, and decision-making entail the ability to project into the future. Crucially, animal behavior in natural settings implies that the brain can generate representations of future scenarios not only quickly but also constantly over time, as external events continually unfold. Despite this insight, how the brain accomplishes this remains unknown. Here we report neural activity in the hippocampus encoding two future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz one scenario per 8 Hz cycle (125 ms). We further found that the underlying cycling dynamic generalized across multiple hippocampal representations (location and direction) relevant to future behavior. These findings identify an extremely fast and regular dynamical process capable of representing future possibilities.</p>
