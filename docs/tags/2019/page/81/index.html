          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Breaking barriers The effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition in academics, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>Lay summaryIn the past decade the scientific community has been trying to tackle the historical underrepresentation of women in science and the fact that gender can constitute a barrier to career success. However, other characteristics, such as being of an ethnic minority or coming from an under-privileged background, have received less attention. In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier. Our data suggest we need to widen the discussion regarding diversity and equality in science to incorporate potential barriers to career success in addition to gender.AbstractThe academic disciplines of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have long suffered from a lack of diversity. While in recent years there has been some progress in addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM subjects, other protected characteristics have received less attention. In this study, we survey early career scientists in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, behaviour, and related disciplines. We (i) quantitatively examine the effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition, and (ii) provide practical suggestions, based on the qualitative responses of those surveyed, for overcoming some of the barriers we identified. We found that socioeconomic background and ethnicity impacted negatively on the quantitative measures of career progression we examined. Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression. This may reflect the fact that these characteristics have received less attention, and are therefore deemed more sensitive. We hope that this study will stimulate wider discussion, and help to inform strategies to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM subjects.</p>

          <p>AbstractCRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing has enabled the direct manipulation of gene function in many species. However, the reproductive biology of reptiles presents unique barriers for the use of this technology, and there are currently no reptiles with effective methods for targeted mutagenesis. Here we present a new approach that enables the efficient production of CRISPR-Cas9 induced mutations in Anolis lizards, an important model for studies of reptile evolution and development.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training in trained young men is largely attributed to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTCellular adaptations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to high-volume resistance training are not well-characterized. Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty-one previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a &#43;23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p&amp;lt;0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p&amp;lt;0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, both myosin and actin concentrations decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p&amp;lt;0.05). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p&amp;lt;0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. &amp;lt;0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value &amp;lt;0.05) a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (&#43;66%, p&amp;lt;0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~−50%, p&amp;lt;0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The mutational landscape of a prion-like domain, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecific insoluble protein aggregates are the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases1–5. For example, cytoplasmic aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are observed in 97% of cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)6,7. However, it is still unclear for ALS and other diseases whether it is the insoluble aggregates or other forms of the mutated proteins that cause these diseases that are actually toxic to cells8–13. Here we address this question for TDP-43 by systematically mutating14 the protein and quantifying the effects on cellular toxicity. We generated &amp;gt;50,000 mutations in the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PRD) and observed that changes in hydrophobicity and aggregation potential are highly predictive of changes in toxicity. Surprisingly, however, increased hydrophobicity and cytoplasmic aggregation actually reduce cellular toxicity. Mutations have their strongest effects in a central region of the PRD, with variants that increase toxicity promoting the formation of more dynamic liquid-like condensates. The genetic interactions in double mutants reveal that specific structures exist in this ‘unstructured’ region in vivo. Our results demonstrate that deep mutagenesis is a powerful approach for probing the sequence-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins as well as their in vivo structural conformations. Moreover, we show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but actually protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cohesin disrupts polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractHow chromosome organisation is related to genome function remains poorly understood. Cohesin, loop-extrusion, and CTCF have been proposed to create structures called topologically associating domains (TADs) to regulate gene expression. Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find as in other cell types that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate AB compartmentalisation. However, in the absence of cohesin we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system, depend on PRC1, and we discover that cohesin counteracts these interactions. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and TADs, and regulates gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, in contrast to the proposal that cohesin creates structure in chromosomes, we discover a new role for cohesin in disrupting polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to regulate gene expression.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Common DNA sequence variation influences 3-dimensional conformation of the human genome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe 3-dimensional (3D) conformation of chromatin inside the nucleus is integral to a variety of nuclear processes including transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. Aberrations in 3D chromatin conformation have been implicated in developmental abnormalities and cancer. Despite the importance of 3D chromatin conformation to cellular function and human health, little is known about how 3D chromatin conformation varies in the human population, or whether DNA sequence variation between individuals influences 3D chromatin conformation. To address these questions, we performed Hi-C on Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from 20 individuals. We identified thousands of regions across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength, contact insulation, contact directionality and density of localciscontacts. We mapped hundreds of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes as well as complex disease risk. Our results demonstrate that common DNA sequence variants can influence 3D chromatin conformation, pointing to a more pervasive role for 3D chromatin conformation in human phenotypic variation than previously recognized.</p>
