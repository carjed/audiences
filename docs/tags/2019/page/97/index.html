          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clustering co-abundant genes identifies components of the gut microbiome that are reproducibly associated with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health. By proposing a new computational approach for handling high dimensional metagenomics data, we identified specific microbial gene groups that are associated with disease that can be used to identify strains of interest for further preclinical and mechanistic experimentation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Functional metagenomics-guided discovery of potent Cas9 inhibitors in the human microbiome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractCRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria and archaea from phages and other mobile genetic elements, which use small anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to overcome CRISPR-Cas immunity. Because they are difficult to identify, the natural diversity and impact of Acrs on microbial ecosystems is underappreciated. To overcome this discovery bottleneck, we developed a high-throughput functional selection that isolates acr genes based on their ability to inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. Using this selection, we discovered ten DNA fragments from human oral and fecal metagenomes that antagonize Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9). The most potent acr discovered, acrIIA11, was recovered from a Lachnospiraceae phage and is among the strongest known SpyCas9 inhibitors. AcrIIA11 homologs are distributed across multiple bacterial phyla and many divergent homologs inhibit SpyCas9. We show that AcrIIA11 antagonizes SpyCas9 using a different mechanism than that of previously characterized inhibitors. Our study highlights the power of functional selections to uncover widespread Cas9 inhibitors within diverse microbiomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Trichoplax microbiome the simplest animal lives in an intimate symbiosis with two intracellular bacteria, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>Summary paragraphPlacozoa is an enigmatic phylum of simple, microscopic, marine metazoans. Although intracellular bacteria have been found in all members of this phylum, almost nothing is known about their identity, location and interactions with their host. We used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of single host individuals, plus metaproteomic and imaging analyses, to show that the placozoan Trichoplax H2 lives in symbiosis with two intracellular bacteria. One symbiont forms a new genus in the Midichloriaceae (Rickettsiales) and has a genomic repertoire similar to that of rickettsial parasites, but does not appear to express key genes for energy parasitism. Correlative microscopy and 3-D electron tomography revealed that this symbiont resides in an unusual location, the rough endoplasmic reticulum of its host’s internal fiber cells. The second symbiont belongs to the Margulisbacteria, a phylum without cultured representatives and not known to form intracellular associations. This symbiont lives in the ventral epithelial cells of Trichoplax, likely metabolizes algal lipids digested by its host, and has the capacity to supplement the placozoan’s nutrition. Our study shows that even the simplest animals known have evolved highly specific and intimate associations with symbiotic, intracellular bacteria, and highlights that symbioses with microorganisms are a basal trait of animal life.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A robust and efficient method for Mendelian randomization with hundreds of genetic variants unravelling mechanisms linking HDL-cholesterol and coronary heart disease, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05</h4>
          <p>Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations with large numbers of genetic variants are becoming increasingly common. However, the reliability of findings from a MR investigation is dependent on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables. We developed a method to identify groups of genetic variants with similar causal effect estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Our contamination mixture method is a robust and efficient method for valid MR in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, our method had the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method is fast and efficient, and can perform analysis with hundreds of variants in a fraction of a second. In a MR analysis for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, the method identified 11 variants associated with increased HDL-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased CHD risk that had the same directions of associations with platelet distribution width and other blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and CHD risk relating to platelet aggregation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">About samples, giving examples Optimized Single Molecule Localization Microscopy, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractSuper-resolution microscopy has profoundly transformed how we study the architecture of cells, revealing unknown structures and refining our view of cellular assemblies. Among the various techniques, the resolution of Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) can reach the size of macromolecular complexes and offer key insights on their nanoscale arrangement in situ. SMLM is thus a demanding technique and taking advantage of its full potential requires specifically optimized procedures. Here we describe how we perform the successive steps of an SMLM workflow, focusing on single-color Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) as well as multicolor DNA Points Accumulation for imaging in Nanoscale Topography (DNA-PAINT) of fixed samples. We provide detailed procedures for careful sample fixation and immunostaining of typical cellular structures cytoskeleton, clathrin-coated pits, and organelles. We then offer guidelines for optimal imaging and processing of SMLM data in order to optimize reconstruction quality and avoid the generation of artifacts. We hope that the tips and tricks we discovered over the years and detail here will be useful for researchers looking to make the best possible SMLM images, a pre-requisite for meaningful biological discovery.</p>
