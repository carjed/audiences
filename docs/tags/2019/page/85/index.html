          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modulation of visual cortex by hippocampal signals, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25</h4>
          <p>Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are influenced by the animal’s position in the environment and encode positions that correlate with those encoded by hippocampus (CA1). Might V1’s encoding of spatial positions be inherited from hippocampal regions? If so, it should depend on non-visual factors that affect the encoding of position in hippocampus, such as the physical distance traveled and the phase of theta oscillations. We recorded V1 and CA1 neurons while mice ran through a virtual corridor and confirmed these predictions. Spatial representations in V1 and CA1 were correlated even in the absence of visual cues. Moreover, similar to CA1 place cells, the spatial responses of V1 neurons were influenced by the physical distance traveled and the phase of hippocampal theta oscillations. These results reveal a modulation of cortical sensory processing by non-sensory estimates of position that might originate in hippocampal regions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Serum Flt3 ligand is biomarker of progenitor cell mass and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractFms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) is a hematopoietic growth factor receptor expressed on lymphomyeloid progenitors and frequently, by AML blasts. Its ligand, Flt3L, has non-hematopoietic and lymphoid origins, is detectable during homeostasis and increases to high levels in states of hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Measurement of Flt3L by ELISA reveals that Flt3&#43;AML, is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering CR, but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the BM. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 135 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival Flt3L ≤ 291pgml was associated with inferior event-free survival; and, Flt3L &amp;gt;1185pgml was associated with higher overall survival (p = 0.0119). Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML further illustrated the potential value of declining Flt3L to identify relapse. Together these observations suggest that measurement of Flt3L provides a non-invasive estimate of progenitor cell mass in most patients with AML, with the potential to inform clinical decisions.Graphical abstract&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float fig-type=figure orientation=portrait&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=588319_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bipartite anchoring of SCREAM enforces stomatal initiation by coupling MAP Kinases to SPEECHLESS, bioRxiv, 2019-03-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractCell-fate in eukaryotes is regulated by MAP Kinases (MAPKs) that translate external cues to cellular responses. In plants, two MAPKs, MPK36, regulate diverse processes of development, environmental response, and immunity. Yet, the mechanism bridging these shared signaling components with a specific target remains unresolved. Focusing on the development of stomata, epidermal valves for gas exchange and transpiration, we report here that the bHLH protein SCREAM functions as a scaffold by recruiting MPK36 to downregulate SPEECHLESS, a transcription factor initiating stomatal cell lineages. SCREAM directly binds with MPK36 through an evolutionarily-conserved yet unconventional bipartite motif. Mutations in this motif abrogate association, phosphorylation and degradation of SCREAM, unmask hidden non-redundancies between MPK3 and MPK6, and result in uncontrolled stomatal differentiation. Structural analyses of MPK6 at the 2.75Å resolution unraveled bipartite binding of SCREAM with MPK6, that is distinct from an upstream MAPKK. Our findings elucidate, at the atomic resolution, the mechanism directly linking extrinsic signals to transcriptional reprogramming during the establishment of stomatal cell-fate, and highlight a unique substrate-binding mode adopted by plant MAPKs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Spatial structure governs the mode of tumour evolution, bioRxiv, 2019-03-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractCharacterizing the mode – the way, manner, or pattern – of evolution in tumours is important for clinical forecasting and optimizing cancer treatment. DNA sequencing studies have inferred various modes, including branching, punctuated and neutral evolution, but it is unclear why a particular pattern predominates in any given tumour.1, 2 Here we propose that differences in tumour architecture alone can explain the variety of observed patterns. We examine this hypothesis using spatially explicit population genetic models and demonstrate that, within biologically relevant parameter ranges, human tumours are expected to exhibit four distinct onco-evolutionary modes (oncoevotypes) rapid clonal expansion (predicted in leukaemia); progressive diversification (in colorectal adenomas and early-stage colorectal carcinomas); branching evolution (in invasive glandular tumours); and effectively almost neutral evolution (in certain non-glandular and poorly differentiated solid tumours). We thus provide a simple, mechanistic explanation for a wide range of empirical observations. Oncoevotypes are governed by the mode of cell dispersal and the range of cell-cell interaction, which we show are essential factors in accurately characterizing, forecasting and controlling tumour evolution.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The ability of single genes vs full genomes to resolve time and space in outbreak analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-03-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractInexpensive pathogen genome sequencing has had a transformative effect on the field of phylodynamics, where ever increasing volumes of data have promised real-time insight into outbreaks of infectious disease. As well as the sheer volume of pathogen isolates being sequenced, the sequencing of whole pathogen genomes, rather than select loci, has allowed phylogenetic analyses to be carried out at finer time scales, often approaching serial intervals for infections caused by rapidly evolving RNA viruses. Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (~19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ~2kb long) gene. We quantify changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compare these to theoretical expectations. We propose a simple intuitive metric for quantifying temporal resolution, i.e. the time scale over which sequence data might be informative of various processes as a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation of statistical power available to molecular clock analyses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An image-computable model for the stimulus selectivity of gamma oscillations, bioRxiv, 2019-03-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractGamma oscillations in visual cortex have been hypothesized to be critical for perception, cognition, and information transfer. However, observations of these oscillations in visual cortex vary widely; some studies report little to no stimulus-induced narrowband gamma oscillations, others report oscillations for only some stimuli, and yet others report large oscillations for most stimuli. To reconcile these findings and better understand this signal, we developed a model that predicts gamma responses for arbitrary images and validated this model on electrocorticography (ECoG) data from human visual cortex. The model computes variance across the outputs of spatially pooled orientation channels, and accurately predicts gamma amplitude across 86 images. Gamma responses were large for a small subset of stimuli, differing dramatically from fMRI and ECoG broadband (non-oscillatory) responses. We suggest that gamma oscillations in visual cortex serve as a biomarker of gain control rather than being a fundamental mechanism for communicating visual information.</p>
