          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">GWAS of brain volume on 54,407 individuals and cross-trait analysis with intelligence identifies shared genomic loci and genes, bioRxiv, 2019-04-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe phenotypic correlation between human intelligence and brain volume (BV) is considerable (r≈0.40), and has been shown to be due to shared genetic factors1. To further examine specific genetic factors driving this correlation, we present genomic analyses of the genetic overlap between intelligence and BV using genome-wide association study (GWAS) results. First, we conducted the largest BV GWAS meta-analysis to date (N=54,407 individuals), followed by functional annotation and gene-mapping. We identified 35 genomic loci (27 novel), implicating 362 genes (346 novel) and 23 biological pathways for BV. Second, we used an existing GWAS for intelligence (N=269,867 individuals2), and estimated the genetic correlation (rg) between BV and intelligence to be 0.23. We show that the rg is driven by physical overlap of GWAS hits in 5 genomic loci. We identified 67 shared genes between BV and intelligence, which are mainly involved in important signaling pathways regulating cell growth. Out of these 67 we prioritized 32 that are most likely to have functional impact. These results provide new information on the genetics of BV and provide biological insight into BV’s shared genetic etiology with intelligence.</p>

          <p>AbstractCombining the molecular specificity of fluorescent probes with three-dimensional (3D) imaging at nanoscale resolution is critical for investigating the spatial organization and interactions of cellular organelles and protein complexes. We present a super-resolution light microscope that enables simultaneous multicolor imaging of whole mammalian cells at ~20 nm 3D resolution. We show its power for cell biology research with fluorescence images that resolved the highly convoluted Golgi apparatus and the close contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane, structures that have traditionally been the imaging realm of electron microscopy.One Sentence SummaryComplex cellular structures previously only resolved by electron microscopy can now be imaged in multiple colors by 4Pi-SMS.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Shared morphological consequences of global warming in North American migratory birds, bioRxiv, 2019-04-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIncreasing temperatures associated with climate change are predicted to cause reductions in body size, a key determinant of animal physiology and ecology. Using a four-decade specimen series of 70,716 individuals of 52 North American migratory bird species, we demonstrate that increasing annual summer temperature over the 40-year period drove consistent reductions in body size across these diverse taxa. Concurrently, wing length – which impacts nearly all aspects of avian ecology and behavior – has consistently increased across taxa. Our findings suggest that warming-induced body size reduction is a general response to climate change, and reveal a similarly consistent shift in an ecologically-important dimension of body shape. We hypothesize that increasing wing length represents a compensatory adaptation to maintain migration as reductions in body size have increased the metabolic cost of flight. An improved understanding of warming-induced morphological changes, and their limits, are important for predicting biotic responses to global change.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single Cortical Neurons as Deep Artificial Neural Networks, bioRxiv, 2019-04-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe propose a novel approach based on modern deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) for understanding how the morpho-electrical complexity of neurons shapes their inputoutput (IO) properties at the millisecond resolution in response to massive synaptic input. The IO of integrate and fire point neuron is accurately captured by a DNN with a single unit and one hidden layer. A fully connected DNN with one hidden layer faithfully replicated the IO relationship of a detailed model of Layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell (L5PC) receiving AMPA and GABAA synapses. However, when adding voltage-gated NMDA-conductances, a temporally-convolutional DNN with seven layers was required. Analysis of the DNN filters provides new insights into dendritic processing shaping the IO properties of neurons. This work proposes a systematic approach for characterizing the functional “depth” of a biological neurons, suggesting that cortical pyramidal neurons and the networks they form are computationally much more powerful than previously assumed.</p>

          <p>AbstractEnteroBase is an integrated software environment which supports the identification of global population structures within several bacterial genera including pathogens. It currently contains more than 300,000 genomes that have been assembled from Illumina short reads from the genera Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridiodes, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella. With the recent introduction of hierarchical clustering of core genome MLST sequence types, EnteroBase now facilitates the identification of close relatives of bacteria within those genera inside of a few hours of uploading their short reads. It also supports private collaborations between groups of users, and the comparison of genomic data that were assembled from short reads with SNP calls that were extracted from metagenomic sequences. Here we provide an overview for its users on how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. This user’s guide is illustrated by three case studies ranging in scale from the miniscule (local transmission of Salmonella between neighboring social groups of badgers) through pandemic transmission of plague and microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5,000 years to a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of Escherichia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A revised model for promoter competition based on multi-way chromatin interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-04-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecific communication between gene promoters and enhancers is critical for accurate regulation of gene expression. However, it remains unclear how specific interactions between multiple regulatory elements and genes contained within a single chromatin domain are coordinated. Recent technological advances allow for the investigation of multi-way chromatin interactions at single alleles in individual nuclei. This can provide insights into how multiple regulatory elements cooperate or compete for transcriptional activation. We have used these techniques in a mouse model in which the α-globin domain is extended to include several additional genes. This allows us to determine how the interactions of the α-globin super-enhancer are distributed between multiple promoters in a single domain. Our data show that gene promoters do not form mutually exclusive interactions with the super-enhancer, but all interact simultaneously in a single complex. These finding show that promoters within the same domain do not structurally compete for interactions with enhancers, but form a regulatory hub structure, consistent with the recent model of transcriptional activation in phase-separated nuclear condensates.</p>
