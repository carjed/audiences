          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Convergent gene loss in aquatic plants predicts new components of plant immunity and drought response, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe transition of plants from sea to land sparked an arms race with pathogens. The increased susceptibility of land plants is largely thought to be due to their dependence on micro-organisms for nutrients; the ensuing co-evolution has shaped the plant immune system. By profiling the immune receptors across flowering plants, we identified species with low numbers of NLR immune receptors. Interestingly, four of these species represent distinct lineages of monocots and dicots that returned to the aquatic lifestyle. Both aquatic monocot and dicot species lost the same well-known downstream immune signalling complex (EDS1-PAD4). This observation inspired us to look for other genes with a similar loss pattern and allowed us to predict putative new components of plant immunity. Gene expression analyses confirmed that a group of these genes was differentially expressed under pathogen infection. Excitingly, another subset of these genes was differentially expressed upon drought. Collectively, our study reveals the minimal plant immune system required for life under water, and highlights additional components required for the life of land plants.Author summaryPlant resistance to pathogens is commonly mediated by a complex gene family, known as NLRs. Upon pathogen infection, changes in the cellular environment trigger NLR activation and subsequent defence responses. Despite the dependence of agricultural practices on NLR genes to control pathogen load, relatively little is known about this gene family outside of model crop species. In this study, we identified a convergent reduction in the NLR gene family among two lineages of aquatic plants. Furthermore, we established that NLR reduction occurred in conjunction with the loss of a common immune signalling pathway. Subsequently, we identified other genes convergently lost in aquatic species and propose these as candidate components of the plant immune signalling pathway. In addition, we revealed components of the agronomically important drought response to be lost in aquatic plants. This study adds to our understanding of the complex interactions between environment and response to biotic stress, widely known as the disease triangle. The pathways identified in this study shed further light on the link between responses to drought and disease.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-speed multifocal plane fluorescence microscopy for three-dimensional visualisation of beating flagella, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractAnalysis of flagellum beating in three dimensions is important for understanding how cells can undergo complex flagellum-driven motility and the ability to use fluorescence microscopy for such three-dimensional analysis would be extremely powerful. Trypanosoma and Leishmania are unicellular parasites which undergo complex cell movements in three dimensions as they swim and would particularly benefit from such an analysis. Here, high-speed multifocal plane fluorescence microscopy, a technique in which a light path multi-splitter is used to visualise 4 focal planes simultaneously, was used to reconstruct the flagellum beating of Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania mexicana in three dimensions. It was possible to use either an organic fluorescent stain or a genetically-encoded fluorescence fusion protein to visualise flagellum and cell movement in three dimensions at a 200 Hz frame rate. This high-speed multifocal plane fluorescence microscopy approach was used to address two open questions regarding Trypanosoma and Leishmania swimming To quantify the planarity of the L. mexicana flagellum beat and analyse the nature of flagellum beating during T. brucei ‘tumbling’.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Landscape of multi-nucleotide variants in 125,748 human exomes and 15,708 genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractMulti-nucleotide variants (MNVs), defined as two or more nearby variants existing on the same haplotype in an individual, are a clinically and biologically important class of genetic variation. However, existing tools for variant interpretation typically do not accurately classify MNVs, and understanding of their mutational origins remains limited. Here, we systematically survey MNVs in 125,748 whole exomes and 15,708 whole genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 1,996,125 MNVs across the genome with constituent variants falling within 2 bp distance of one another, of which 31,510 exist within the same codon, including 405 predicted to result in gain of a nonsense mutation, 1,818 predicted to rescue a nonsense mutation event that would otherwise be caused by one of the constituent variants, and 16,481 additional variants predicted to alter protein sequences. We show that the distribution of MNVs is highly non-uniform across the genome, and that this non-uniformity can be largely explained by a variety of known mutational mechanisms, such as CpG deamination, replication error by polymerase zeta, or polymerase slippage at repeat junctions. We also provide an estimate of the dinucleotide mutation rate caused by polymerase zeta. Finally, we show that differential CpG methylation drives MNV differences across functional categories. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating haplotype-aware annotation for accurate functional interpretation of genetic variation, and refine our understanding of genome-wide mutational mechanisms of MNVs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Metabolic Diversity in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>SummaryIntermediary metabolism in cancer cells is regulated by diverse cell-autonomous processes including signal transduction and gene expression patterns arising from specific oncogenotypes and cell lineages. Although it is well established that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, we lack a full view of the diversity of metabolic programs in cancer cells and an unbiased assessment of the associations between metabolic pathway preferences and other cell-autonomous processes. Here we quantified over 100 metabolic features, mostly from 13C enrichment of molecules from central carbon metabolism, in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines cultured under identical conditions. Because these cell lines were extensively annotated for oncogenotype, gene expression, protein expression and therapeutic sensitivity, the resulting database enables the user to uncover new relationships between metabolism and these orthogonal processes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The life of P.I. Transitions to Independence in Academia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>The data in this report summarises the responses gathered from 365 principal investigators of academic laboratories, who started their independent positions in the UK within the last 6 years up to 2018. We find that too many new investigators express frustration and poor optimism for the future. These data also reveal, that many of these individuals lack the support required to make a successful transition to independence and that simple measures could be put in place by both funders and universities in order to better support these early career researchers. We use these data to make both recommendations of good practice and for changes to policies that would make significant improvements to those currently finding independence challenging. We find that some new investigators face significant obstacles when building momentum and hiring a research team. In particular, access to PhD students. We also find some important areas such as starting salaries where significant gender differences persist, which cannot be explained by seniority. Our data also underlines the importance of support networks, within and outside the department, and the positive influence of good mentorship through this difficult career stage.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cytokinin functions as an asymmetric and anti-gravitropic signal in lateral roots, bioRxiv, 2019-03-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractDirectional organ growth allows the plant root system to strategically cover its surroundings. Intercellular auxin transport is aligned with the gravity vector in the primary root tips, facilitating downward organ bending at the lower root flank. Here we show that cytokinin signaling functions as a lateral root specific anti-gravitropic component, promoting the radial distribution of the root system. We performed a genome-wide association study and revealed that signal peptide processing of Cytokinin Oxidase 2 (CKX2) affects its enzymatic activity and, thereby, determines the degradation of cytokinins in natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. Cytokinin signaling interferes with growth at the upper lateral root flank and thereby prevents downward bending. Our interdisciplinary approach revealed that two phytohormonal cues at opposite organ flanks counterbalance each other’s negative impact on growth, suppressing organ growth towards gravity and allow for radial expansion of the root system.</p>
