          <p>AbstractHybrid genome assembly has emerged as an important technique in bacterial genomics, but cost and labor requirements limit large-scale application. We present Ultraplexing, a method to improve per-sample sequencing cost and hands-on-time of Nanopore sequencing for hybrid assembly by at least 50%, compared to molecular barcoding while maintaining high assembly quality (Quality Value; QV ≥ 42). Ultraplexing requires the availability of Illumina data and uses inter-sample genetic variability to assign reads to isolates, which obviates the need for molecular barcoding. Thus, Ultraplexing can enable significant sequencing and labor cost reductions in large-scale bacterial genome projects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Poor test-retest reliability of task-fMRI New empirical evidence and a meta-analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractIdentifying brain biomarkers of disease risk and treatment response is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is fundamentally limited by measurement reliability; measures that do not yield reliable values are unsuitable as biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments with 1,088 participants reporting 1,146 ICCs for task-fMRI revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC = .397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 commonly used fMRI tasks collected in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Longitudinal Study were poor (ICCs = .067 - .485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that commonly used task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience (i.e., brain-behavior mapping). We review how this state of affairs came to be and consider several avenues for improving the reliability of task-fMRI.Significance StatementA biomarker with the potential to be useful in predicting clinical outcomes must yield values that are repeatable. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the test-retest reliability of task-fMRI measures, which are widely adopted for biomarker discovery in neuroscience. We found that the meta-analytic reliability of task-fMRI was poor. We also investigated the reliability of many of the most commonly used task-fMRI measures in two datasets recently collected with cutting-edge scanners and methods. We found generally poor reliability for these task-fMRI measures. These findings indicate that many task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A receptor for herbivore-associated molecular patterns mediates plant immunity, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractPlant-herbivore interactions are ubiquitous across nature and drive major agricultural losses. Inducible defense responses triggered through immune recognition aid in host plant protection; however, specific ligand-receptor pairs mediating the initial perception of herbivory remain unknown. Plants in the subtribe Phaseolinae detect herbivore-associated peptides in caterpillar oral secretions and the defined ligands are proteolytic fragments of chloroplastic ATP synthase termed inceptins. Using forward genetic mapping of inceptin-induced responses, we identify a cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein as an inceptin receptor (INR) sufficient for elicitor-induced responses and enhanced defense against armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). INR defines a receptor by which plants perceive herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and expands the paradigm of surface immune recognition to attack with mandibles.One Sentence SummaryA plant cell surface receptor directly perceives peptides associated with caterpillar herbivory.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Brain state stability during working memory is explained by network control theory, modulated by dopamine D1D2 receptor function, and diminished in schizophrenia, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory entails brain-wide switching between activity states. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Schizophrenia patients show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic screens in isogenic mammalian cell lines without single cell cloning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>Isogenic pairs of cell lines, which differ by a single genetic modification, are powerful tools for understanding gene function. Generating such pairs for mammalian cells, however, is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and impossible in some cell types. Here we present an approach to create isogenic pairs of cells and screen them with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 libraries to generate genetic interaction maps. We queried the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2L1 and MCL1, and the DNA damage repair gene PARP1, via 25 genome-wide screens across 4 cell lines. For all three genes, we identify a rich set of both expected and novel buffering and synthetic lethal interactions. Further, we compare the interactions observed in genetic space to those found when targeting these genes with small molecules and identify hits that may inform the clinical uses for these inhibitors. We anticipate that this methodology will be broadly useful to comprehensively study genes of interest across many cell types.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The effect of bioRxiv preprints on citations and altmetrics, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>1.AbstractA potential motivation for scientists to deposit their scientific work as preprints is to enhance its citation or social impact, an effect which has been empirically observed for preprints in physics, astronomy and mathematics deposited to arXiv. In this study we assessed the citation and altmetric advantage of bioRxiv, a preprint server for the biological sciences. We retrieved metadata of all bioRxiv preprints deposited between November 2013 and December 2017, and matched them to articles that were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. Citation data from Scopus and altmetric data from &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpAltmetric.com&gt;Altmetric.com&lt;jatsext-link&gt; were used to compare citation and online sharing behaviour of bioRxiv preprints, their related journal articles, and non-deposited articles published in the same journals. We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles received a sizeable citation and altmetric advantage over non-deposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the article and its authorship. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has been subsequently published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles.</p>
