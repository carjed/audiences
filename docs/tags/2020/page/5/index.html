          <p>AbstractAuxin-Inducible Degron (AID) technology enables conditional depletion of targeted proteins. However, the applicability of the AID in vertebrate cells has been limited due to cytotoxicity caused by high auxin concentrations. Here, we establish an improved AID system using an engineered orthogonal auxin-TIR1 pair, which exhibits over 1,000 times stronger binding. With ~1,000-fold less auxin concentration, we achieved to generate the AID-based knockout cells in various human and mouse cell lines in a single transfection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Connectomics analysis reveals first, second, and third order thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons in the adult Drosophila brain, bioRxiv, 2020-01-21</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYAnimals exhibit innate and learned preferences for temperature and humidity – conditions critical for their survival and reproduction. Here, we leveraged a whole adult brain electron microscopy volume to study the circuitry associated with antennal thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons, which target specific ventroposterior (VP) glomeruli in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe. We have identified two new VP glomeruli, in addition to the five known ones, and the projection neurons (VP PNs) that relay VP information to higher brain centres, including the mushroom body and lateral horn, seats of learned and innate olfactory behaviours, respectively. Focussing on the mushroom body lateral accessory calyx (lACA), a known thermosensory neuropil, we present a comprehensive connectome by reconstructing neurons downstream of heating- and cooling-responsive VP PNs. We find that a few lACA-associated mushroom body intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) solely receive thermosensory inputs, while most receive additional olfactory and thermo- or hygrosensory PN inputs in the main calyx. Unexpectedly, we find several classes of lACA-associated neurons that form a local network with outputs to other brain neuropils, suggesting that the lACA serves as a general hub for thermosensory circuitry. For example, we find DN1 pacemaker neurons that link the lACA to the accessory medulla, likely mediating temperature-based entrainment of the circadian clock. Finally, we survey strongly connected downstream partners of VP PNs across the protocerebrum; these include a descending neuron that receives input mainly from dry-responsive VP PNs, meaning that just two synapses might separate hygrosensory inputs from motor neurons in the nerve cord.

          <p>AbstractSuper-Resolution (SR) Microscopy based on 3D Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is now well established1,2 and its wide-spread adoption has led to the development of more than 36 software packages, dedicated to quantitative evaluation of the spatial and temporal detection of fluorophore photoswitching3. While the initial emphasis in the 3D SMLM field has clearly been on improving resolution and data quality, there is now a marked absence of 3D visualization approaches that enable the straightforward, high-fidelity exploration of this type of data. Inspired by the horological phosphorescence points that illuminate watch-faces in the dark, we present vLUME (Visualization of the Universe in a Micro Environment, pronounced ‘volume’) a free-for-academic-use immersive virtual reality-based (VR) visualization software package purposefully designed to render large 3D-SMLM data sets. vLUME enables robust visualization, segmentation and quantification of millions of fluorescence puncta from any 3D SMLM technique. vLUME has an intuitive user-interface and is compatible with all commercial VR hardware (Oculus RiftQuest and HTC Vive, Supplementary Video 1). vLUME accelerates the analysis of highly complex 3D point-cloud data and the rapid identification of defects that are otherwise neglected in global quality metrics.</p>

          <p>AbstractAs reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">AAV Ablates Neurogenesis in the Adult Murine Hippocampus, bioRxiv, 2020-01-20</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTRecombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been widely used as a viral vector across mammalian biology and has been shown to be safe and effective in human gene therapy. We demonstrate that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and immature dentate granule cells (DGCs) within the adult murine hippocampus are particularly sensitive to rAAV-induced cell death. Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent, with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hours post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression, consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentate gyrus (DG)—without ablating adult neurogenesis—can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact. These findings expand on recent reports implicating rAAV-linked toxicity in stem cells and other cell types and suggest that future work using rAAV as an experimental tool in the DG and as a gene therapy for diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) should be carefully evaluated.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Design of a biosensor for direct visualisation of auxin, bioRxiv, 2020-01-20</h4>
          <p>In plants, one of the most important regulative small molecules is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) known as auxin. Its dynamic redistribution plays an essential role in virtually every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity1,2. So far, the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at cellular resolution could not be determined directly. Instead it has been inferred from visualisation of irreversible processes involving the endogenous auxin response machinery3-7. This detection system failed to record transient changes. Here we report on a genetically encoded biosensor for quantitative in vivo visualisation of auxin distributions. The sensor is based on the E. coli tryptophan repressor (TrpR)8 whose binding pocket was engineered for specific IAA binding and coupled to fluorescent proteins to employ FRET as readout. This sensor, unlike previous systems, enables direct monitoring of the fast uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells in the plant as well as the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors. Thus, our auxin sensor enables mapping of auxin concentrations at (sub)cellular resolution and their changes in time and space during plant life.</p>
