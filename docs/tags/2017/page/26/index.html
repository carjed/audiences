          <p>AbstractAttention-DeficitHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable childhood behavioral disorder affecting 5% of school-age children and 2.5% of adults. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ADHD susceptibility, but no individual variants have been robustly associated with ADHD. We report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 20,183 ADHD cases and 35,191 controls that identifies variants surpassing genome-wide significance in 12 independent loci, revealing new and important information on the underlying biology of ADHD. Associations are enriched in evolutionarily constrained genomic regions and loss-of-function intolerant genes, as well as around brain-expressed regulatory marks. These findings, based on clinical interviews andor medical records are supported by additional analyses of a self-reported ADHD sample and a study of quantitative measures of ADHD symptoms in the population. Meta-analyzing these data with our primary scan yielded a total of 16 genome-wide significant loci. The results support the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis of ADHD is an extreme expression of one or more continuous heritable traits.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Improving the value of public RNA-seq expression data by phenotype prediction, bioRxiv, 2017-06-04</h4>
          <p>Abstract&lt;jatssec id=sa1&gt;BackgroundPublicly available genomic data are a valuable resource for studying normal human variation and disease, but these data are often not well labeled or annotated. The lack of phenotype information for public genomic data severely limits their utility for addressing targeted biological questions.&lt;jatssec id=sa2&gt;ResultsWe develop an in silico phenotyping approach for predicting critical missing annotation directly from genomic measurements using, well-annotated genomic and phenotypic data produced by consortia like TCGA and GTEx as training data. We apply in silico phenotyping to a set of 70,000 RNA-seq samples we recently processed on a common pipeline as part of the recount2 project (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsjhubiostatistics.shinyapps.iorecount&gt;httpsjhubiostatistics.shinyapps.iorecount&lt;jatsext-link&gt;). We use gene expression data to build and evaluate predictors for both biological phenotypes (sex, tissue, sample source) and experimental conditions (sequencing strategy). We demonstrate how these predictions can be used to study cross-sample properties of public genomic data, select genomic projects with specific characteristics, and perform downstream analyses using predicted phenotypes. The methods to perform phenotype prediction are available in the phenopredict R package (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comleekgroupphenopredict&gt;httpsgithub.comleekgroupphenopredict&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) and the predictions for recount2 are available from the recount R package (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsbioconductor.orgpackagesreleasebiochtmlrecount.html&gt;httpsbioconductor.orgpackagesreleasebiochtmlrecount.html&lt;jatsext-link&gt;)&lt;jatssec id=sa3&gt;ConclusionHaving leveraging massive public data sets to generate a well-phenotyped set of expression data for more than 70,000 human samples, expression data is available for use on a scale that was not previously feasible.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The reproducibility of research and the misinterpretation of P values, bioRxiv, 2017-06-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe wish to answer this question If you observe a “significant” P value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive?. The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks.When you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 31. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5 %, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.If you observe P =0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 1001 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive risk would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe P = 0.00045.It is recommended that the terms “significant” and “non-significant” should never be used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed P value.Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P &amp;lt; 0.05 as “statistically significant”. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomisation and P-hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure,Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine, bioRxiv, 2017-05-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractDeep learning, which describes a class of machine learning algorithms, has recently showed impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data rich, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Problems of this nature may be particularly well-suited to deep learning techniques. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems—patient classification, fundamental biological processes, and treatment of patients—and discuss whether deep learning will transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. We find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize or definitively resolve any of these problems, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even when improvement over a previous baseline has been modest, we have seen signs that deep learning methods may speed or aid human investigation. More work is needed to address concerns related to interpretability and how to best model each problem. Furthermore, the limited amount of labeled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning powering changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">No compelling evidence that preferences for facial masculinity track changes in women’s hormonal status, bioRxiv, 2017-05-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlthough widely cited as strong evidence that sexual selection has shaped human facial attractiveness judgments, evidence that preferences for masculine characteristics in men’s faces are related to women’s hormonal status is equivocal and controversial. Consequently, we conducted the largest ever longitudinal study of the hormonal correlates of women’s preferences for facial masculinity (N=584). Analyses showed no compelling evidence that preferences for facial masculinity were related to changes in women’s salivary steroid hormone levels. Furthermore, both within-subject and between-subject comparisons showed no evidence that oral contraceptive use decreased masculinity preferences. However, women generally preferred masculinized over feminized versions of men’s faces, particularly when assessing men’s attractiveness for short-term, rather than long-term, relationships. Our results do not support the hypothesized link between women’s preferences for facial masculinity and their hormonal status.</p>

          <p>1AbstractWe found tremendous inequality across gene and protein annotation resources. We observe that this bias leads biomedical researchers to focus on richly annotated genes instead of those with the strongest molecular data. We advocate for researchers to reduce these biases by pursuing data-driven hypotheses.</p>
