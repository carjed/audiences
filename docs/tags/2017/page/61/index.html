          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Untangling intelligence, psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, &amp; conduct problems A meta-analytic review, bioRxiv, 2017-01-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractSubstantial research has investigated the association between intelligence and psychopathic traits. The findings to date have been inconsistent and have not always considered the multi-dimensional nature of psychopathic traits. Moreover, there has been a tendency to confuse psychopathy with other closely related, clinically significant disorders. The current study represents a meta-analysis conducted to evaluate the direction and magnitude of the association of intelligence with global psychopathy, as well as its factors and facets, and related disorders (Antisocial Personality Disorder, Conduct Disorder, and Oppositional Defiant Disorder). Our analyses revealed a small, significant, negative relationship between intelligence and total psychopathy (r = -.07, p = .001). Analysis of factors and facets found differential associations, including both significant positive (e.g., interpersonal facet) and negative (e.g., affective facet) associations, further affirming that psychopathy is a multi-dimensional construct. Additionally, intelligence was negatively associated with Antisocial Personality Disorder (r = -.13, p = .001) and Conduct Disorder (r = -.11, p = .001), but positively with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (r = .06, p = .001). There was significant heterogeneity across studies for most effects, but the results of moderator analyses were inconsistent. Finally, bias analyses did not find significant evidence for publication bias or outsized effects of outliers.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evaluation of Oxford Nanopore MinIONTM Sequencing for 16S rRNA Microbiome Characterization, bioRxiv, 2017-01-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn this manuscript we evaluate the potential for microbiome characterization by sequencing of near-full length 16S rRNA gene region fragments using the Oxford Nanopore MinION (hereafter ‘Nanopore’) sequencing platform. We analyzed pure-culture E. coli and P. fluorescens, as well as a low-diversity mixed community sample from hydraulic fracturing produced water. Both closed and open reference operational taxonomic unit (OTU) picking failed, necessitating the direct use of sequences without OTU picking. The Ribosomal Database Project classifier against the Green Genes database was found to be the optimal annotation approach, with average pure-culture annotation accuracies of 93.8% and 82.0% at the phyla and genus levels, respectively. Comparative analysis of an environmental sample using Nanopore and Illumina MiSeq sequencing identified high taxonomic similarity when using a weighted metric (Bray-Curtis), and significantly reduced similarity when using an unweighted metric (Jaccard). These results highlight the great potential of Nanopore sequencing to analyze broad microbial community trends, and the challenge of applying Nanopore sequencing to discern rare taxa in mixed microbial communities. Finally, we observed that between-run carryover following washes on the same flowcell accounted for &amp;gt;10% of sequence reads, necessitating future development to either prevent carryover or filter sequences of interest (e.g. barcoding).</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct visualization of transcriptional activation by physical enhancer–promoter proximity, bioRxiv, 2017-01-12</h4>
          <p>A long-standing question in metazoan gene regulation is how remote enhancers communicate with their target promoters over long distances. Combining genome editing and quantitative live imaging we simultaneously visualize physical enhancer–promoter communication and transcription in Drosophila embryos. Enhancers regulating pair rule stripes of even-skipped expression activate transcription of a reporter gene over a distance of 150 kb. We show in individual cells that activation only occurs after the enhancer comes into close proximity with its regulatory target and that upon dissociation transcription ceases almost immediately. We further observe distinct topological conformations of the eve locus, depending on the spatial identity of the activating stripe enhancer. In addition, long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the endogenous eve locus, causing corresponding developmental defects. Overall, we demonstrate that sustained physical proximity and enhancer–promoter engagement are required for enhancer action, and we provide a path to probe the implications of long-range regulation on cellular fates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation – a benchmark of computational metagenomics software, bioRxiv, 2017-01-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn metagenome analysis, computational methods for assembly, taxonomic profiling and binning are key components facilitating downstream biological data interpretation. However, a lack of consensus about benchmarking datasets and evaluation metrics complicates proper performance assessment. The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on datasets of unprecedented complexity and realism. Benchmark metagenomes were generated from ~700 newly sequenced microorganisms and ~600 novel viruses and plasmids, including genomes with varying degrees of relatedness to each other and to publicly available ones and representing common experimental setups. Across all datasets, assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes, while performance was substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below the family level. Parameter settings substantially impacted performances, underscoring the importance of program reproducibility. While highlighting current challenges in computational metagenomics, the CAMI results provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Multiplex PCR method for MinION and Illumina sequencing of Zika and other virus genomes directly from clinical samples, bioRxiv, 2017-01-10</h4>
          <p>Genome sequencing has become a powerful tool for studying emerging infectious diseases; however, genome sequencing directly from clinical samples without isolation remains challenging for viruses such as Zika, where metagenomic sequencing methods may generate insufficient numbers of viral reads. Here we present a protocol for generating coding-sequence complete genomes comprising an online primer design tool, a novel multiplex PCR enrichment protocol, optimised library preparation methods for the portable MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and the Illumina range of instruments, and a bioinformatics pipeline for generating consensus sequences. The MinION protocol does not require an internet connection for analysis, making it suitable for field applications with limited connectivity. Our method relies on multiplex PCR for targeted enrichment of viral genomes from samples containing as few as 50 genome copies per reaction. Viral consensus sequences can be achieved starting with clinical samples in 1-2 days following a simple laboratory workflow. This method has been successfully used by several groups studying Zika virus evolution and is facilitating an understanding of the spread of the virus in the Americas.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Whole genome sequencing and assembly of a Caenorhabditis elegans genome with complex genomic rearrangements using the MinION sequencing device, bioRxiv, 2017-01-09</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTAdvances in 3rd generation sequencing have opened new possibilities for ‘benchtop’ whole genome sequencing. The MinION is a portable device that uses nanopore technology and can sequence long DNA molecules. MinION long reads are well suited for sequencing and de novo assembly of complex genomes with large repetitive elements. Long reads also facilitate the identification of complex genomic rearrangements such as those observed in tumor genomes. To assess the feasibility of the de novo assembly of large complex genomes using both MinION and Illumina platforms, we sequenced the genome of a Caenorhabditis elegans strain that contains a complex acetaldehyde-induced rearrangement and a biolistic bombardment-mediated insertion of a GFP containing plasmid. Using ∼5.8 gigabases of MinION sequence data, we were able to assemble a C. elegans genome containing 145 contigs (N50 contig length = 1.22 Mb) that covered &amp;gt;99% of the 100,286,401 bp reference genome. In contrast, using ∼8.04 gigabases of Illumina sequence data, we were able to assemble a C. elegans genome in 38,645 contigs (N50 contig length = ∼26 kb) containing 117 Mb. From the MinION genome assembly we identified the complex structures of both the acetaldehyde-induced mutation and the biolistic-mediated insertion. To date, this is the largest genome to be assembled exclusively from MinION data and is the first demonstration that the long reads of MinION sequencing can be used for whole genome assembly of large (100 Mb) genomes and the elucidation of complex genomic rearrangements.</p>
