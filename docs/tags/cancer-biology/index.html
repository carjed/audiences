          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Serum Flt3 ligand is biomarker of progenitor cell mass and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractFms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) is a hematopoietic growth factor receptor expressed on lymphomyeloid progenitors and frequently, by AML blasts. Its ligand, Flt3L, has non-hematopoietic and lymphoid origins, is detectable during homeostasis and increases to high levels in states of hypoplasia due to genetic defects or treatment with cytoreductive agents. Measurement of Flt3L by ELISA reveals that Flt3&#43;AML, is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering CR, but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the BM. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 135 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival Flt3L ≤ 291pgml was associated with inferior event-free survival; and, Flt3L &amp;gt;1185pgml was associated with higher overall survival (p = 0.0119). Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML further illustrated the potential value of declining Flt3L to identify relapse. Together these observations suggest that measurement of Flt3L provides a non-invasive estimate of progenitor cell mass in most patients with AML, with the potential to inform clinical decisions.Graphical abstract&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float fig-type=figure orientation=portrait&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=588319_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Spatial structure governs the mode of tumour evolution, bioRxiv, 2019-03-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractCharacterizing the mode – the way, manner, or pattern – of evolution in tumours is important for clinical forecasting and optimizing cancer treatment. DNA sequencing studies have inferred various modes, including branching, punctuated and neutral evolution, but it is unclear why a particular pattern predominates in any given tumour.1, 2 Here we propose that differences in tumour architecture alone can explain the variety of observed patterns. We examine this hypothesis using spatially explicit population genetic models and demonstrate that, within biologically relevant parameter ranges, human tumours are expected to exhibit four distinct onco-evolutionary modes (oncoevotypes) rapid clonal expansion (predicted in leukaemia); progressive diversification (in colorectal adenomas and early-stage colorectal carcinomas); branching evolution (in invasive glandular tumours); and effectively almost neutral evolution (in certain non-glandular and poorly differentiated solid tumours). We thus provide a simple, mechanistic explanation for a wide range of empirical observations. Oncoevotypes are governed by the mode of cell dispersal and the range of cell-cell interaction, which we show are essential factors in accurately characterizing, forecasting and controlling tumour evolution.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Metabolic Diversity in Human Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>SummaryIntermediary metabolism in cancer cells is regulated by diverse cell-autonomous processes including signal transduction and gene expression patterns arising from specific oncogenotypes and cell lineages. Although it is well established that metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer, we lack a full view of the diversity of metabolic programs in cancer cells and an unbiased assessment of the associations between metabolic pathway preferences and other cell-autonomous processes. Here we quantified over 100 metabolic features, mostly from 13C enrichment of molecules from central carbon metabolism, in over 80 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines cultured under identical conditions. Because these cell lines were extensively annotated for oncogenotype, gene expression, protein expression and therapeutic sensitivity, the resulting database enables the user to uncover new relationships between metabolism and these orthogonal processes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exploiting evolutionary herding to control drug resistance in cancer, bioRxiv, 2019-03-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractDrug resistance mediated by clonal evolution is arguably the biggest problem in cancer therapy today. However, evolving resistance to one drug may come at a cost of decreased growth rate or increased sensitivity to another drug due to evolutionary trade-offs. This weakness can be exploited in the clinic using an approach called ‘evolutionary herding’ that aims at controlling the tumour cell population to delay or prevent resistance. However, recapitulating cancer evolutionary dynamics experimentally remains challenging. Here we present a novel approach for evolutionary herding based on a combination of single-cell barcoding, very large populations of 108–109 cells grown without re-plating, longitudinal non-destructive monitoring of cancer clones, and mathematical modelling of tumour evolution. We demonstrate evolutionary herding in non-small cell lung cancer, showing that herding allows shifting the clonal composition of a tumour in our favour, leading to collateral drug sensitivity and proliferative fitness costs. Through genomic analysis and single-cell sequencing, we were also able to determine the mechanisms that drive such evolved sensitivity. Our approach allows modelling evolutionary trade-offs experimentally to test patient-specific evolutionary herding strategies that can potentially be translated into the clinic to control treatment resistance.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring single cell divisions in human cancers from multi-region sequencing data, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Cancer is driven by complex evolutionary dynamics involving billions of cells. Increasing effort has been dedicated to sequence single tumour cells, but obtaining robust measurements remains challenging. Here we show that multi-region sequencing of bulk tumour samples contains quantitative information on single-cell divisions that is accessible if combined with evolutionary theory. Using high-throughput data from 16 human cancers, we measured the in vivo per-cell point mutation rate (mean 1.69*10^(-8) bp per cell division) and per-cell survival rate (mean 0.57) in individual patient tumours from colon, lung and renal cancers. Per-cell mutation rates varied 50-fold between individuals, and per-cell survival rates were between nearly-homeostatic and almost perfect cell doublings, equating to tumour ages between 1 and 19 years. Furthermore, reanalysing a recent dataset of 89 whole-genome sequenced healthy haematopoietic stem cells, we find 1.14 mutations per genome per cell division and near perfect cell doublings (per-cell survival rate 0.96) during early haematopoietic development. Our analysis measures in vivo the most fundamental properties of human cancer and healthy somatic evolution at single-cell resolution within single individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tissue structure accelerates evolution premalignant sweeps precede neutral expansion, bioRxiv, 2019-02-11</h4>
          <p>Cancer has been hypothesized to be a caricature of the renewal process of the tissue of origin arising from (and maintained by) small subpopulations capable of continuous growth1. The strong influence of the tissue structure has been convincingly demonstrated in intestinal cancers where adenomas grow by the fission of stem-cell-maintained glands influenced by early expression of abnormal cell mobility in cancer progenitors2, 3. So-called “born to be bad” tumors arise from progenitors which may already possess the necessary driver mutations for malignancy4, 5 and metastasis6. These tumors subsequently evolve neutrally, thereby maximizing intratumoral heterogeneity and increasing the probability of therapeutic resistance. These findings have been nuanced by the advent of multi-region sequencing, which uses spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation among competing tumor cell populations to shed light on the mode of tumor evolution (neutral or Darwinian) and also the tempo4, 7–11. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model12–16) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This model approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity competition for space. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Driver acquisition during the Darwinian precancerous stage may be accelerated en route to neutral evolution by the combination of two factors spatial constraints and limited cellular mixing.</p>
