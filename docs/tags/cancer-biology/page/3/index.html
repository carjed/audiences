          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Substantial Batch Effects in TCGA Exome Sequences Undermine Pan-Cancer Analysis of Germline Variants, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBackgroundIn recent years, research on cancer predisposition germline variants has emerged as a prominent field. The identity of somatic mutations is based on a reliable mapping of the patient germline variants. In addition, the statistics of germline variants frequencies in healthy individuals and cancer patients is the basis for seeking candidates for cancer predisposition genes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the main sources of such data, providing a diverse collection of molecular data including deep sequencing for more than 30 types of cancer from &amp;gt;10,000 patients.MethodsOur hypothesis in this study is that whole exome sequences from healthy blood samples of cancer patients are not expected to show systematic differences among cancer types. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed common and rare germline variants across six cancer types, covering 2,241 samples from TCGA. In our analysis we accounted for inherent variables in the data including the different variant calling protocols, sequencing platforms, and ethnicity.ResultsWe report on substantial batch effects in germline variants associated with cancer types. We attribute the effect to the specific sequencing centers that produced the data. Specifically, we measured 30% variability in the number of reported germline variants per sample across sequencing centers. The batch effect is further expressed in nucleotide composition and variant frequencies. Importantly, the batch effect causes substantial differences in germline variant distribution patterns across numerous genes, including prominent cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, RET, MAX, and KRAS. For most of known cancer predisposition genes, we found a distinct batch-dependent difference in germline variants.ConclusionTCGA germline data is exposed to strong batch effects with substantial variabilities among TCGA sequencing centers. We claim that those batch effects are consequential for numerous TCGA pan-cancer studies. In particular, these effects may compromise the reliability and the potency to detect new cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, interpretation of pan-cancer analyses should be revisited in view of the source of the genomic data after accounting for the reported batch effects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Harnessing the Anti-Cancer Natural Product Nimbolide for Targeted Protein Degradation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractNimbolide, a terpenoid natural product derived from the Neem tree, impairs cancer pathogenicity across many types of human cancers; however, the direct targets and mechanisms by which nimbolide exerts its effects are poorly understood. Here, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) chemoproteomic platforms to discover that nimbolide reacts with a novel functional cysteine crucial for substrate recognition in the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114. Nimbolide impairs breast cancer cell proliferation in-part by disrupting RNF114 substrate recognition, leading to inhibition of ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor-suppressors such as p21, resulting in their rapid stabilization. We further demonstrate that nimbolide can be harnessed to recruit RNF114 as an E3 ligase in targeted protein degradation applications and show that synthetically simpler scaffolds are also capable of accessing this unique reactive site. Our study highlights the utility of ABPP platforms in uncovering unique druggable modalities accessed by natural products for cancer therapy and targeted protein degradation applications.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells, bioRxiv, 2018-09-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence has provided a paradigmatic framework for understanding the successive somatic genetic changes and consequent clonal expansions leading to cancer. As for most cancer types, however, understanding of the earliest phases of colorectal neoplastic change, which may occur in morphologically normal tissue, is comparatively limited because of the difficulty of detecting somatic mutations in normal cells. Each colorectal crypt is a small clone of cells derived from a single recently-existing stem cell. Here, we whole genome sequenced hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed, some ubiquitous and continuous, others only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during some phases of the cell lineage from zygote to adult cell. Likely driver mutations were present in ∼1% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Challenges in Using ctDNA to Achieve Early Detection of Cancer, bioRxiv, 2017-12-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractEarly detection of cancer is a significant unmet clinical need. Improved technical ability to detect circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) component of blood plasma via next-generation sequencing and established correlations between ctDNA load and tumor burden in cancer patients have spurred excitement about the possibilities of detecting cancer early by performing ctDNA mutation detection.We reanalyze published data on the expected ctDNA allele fraction in early-stage cancer and the population statistics of cfDNA concentration to show that under conservative technical assumptions, high-sensitivity cancer detection by ctDNA mutation detection will require either more blood volume (150-300mL) than practical for a routine screen or variant filtering that may be impossible given our knowledge of cancer evolution, and will likely remain out of economic reach for routine population screening without multiple-order-of-magnitude decreases in sequencing cost. Instead, new approaches that integrate ctDNA mutations with multiple other blood-based analytes (such as exosomes, circulating tumor cells, ctDNA epigenetics, metabolites) as well as integration of these signals over time for each individual may be needed.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Candidate cancer driver mutations in superenhancers and long-range chromatin interaction networks, bioRxiv, 2017-12-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractA comprehensive catalogue of the mutations that drive tumorigenesis and progression is essential to understanding tumor biology and developing therapies. Protein-coding driver mutations have been well-characterized by large exome-sequencing studies, however many tumors have no mutations in protein-coding driver genes. Non-coding mutations are thought to explain many of these cases, however few non-coding drivers besides TERT promoter are known. To fill this gap, we analyzed 150,000 cis-regulatory regions in 1,844 whole cancer genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. Using our new method, ActiveDriverWGS, we found 41 frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) enriched in non-coding SNVs and indels (FDR&amp;lt;0.05) characterized by aging-associated mutation signatures and frequent structural variants. Most FMREs are distal from genes, reported here for the first time and also recovered by additional driver discovery methods. FMREs were enriched in super-enhancers, H3K27ac enhancer marks of primary tumors and long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that the mutations drive cancer by distally controlling gene expression through threedimensional genome organization. In support of this hypothesis, the chromatin interaction network of FMREs and target genes revealed associations of mutations and differential gene expression of known and novel cancer genes (e.g., CNNB1IP1, RCC1), activation of immune response pathways and altered enhancer marks. Thus distal genomic regions may include additional, infrequently mutated drivers that act on target genes via chromatin loops. Our study is an important step towards finding such regulatory regions and deciphering the somatic mutation landscape of the non-coding genome.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A deep learning system can accurately classify primary and metastatic cancers based on patterns of passenger mutations, bioRxiv, 2017-11-06</h4>
          <p>In cancer, the primary tumour&#39;s organ of origin and histopathology are the strongest determinants of its clinical behaviour, but in 3% of the time a cancer patient presents with metastatic tumour and no obvious primary. Challenges also arise when distinguishing a metastatic recurrence of a previously treated cancer from the emergence of a new one. Here we train a deep learning classifier to predict cancer type based on patterns of somatic passenger mutations detected in whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 2606 tumours representing 24 common cancer types. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of 91% on held-out tumor samples  and 82% and 85% respectively on independent primary and metastatic samples, roughly double the accuracy of trained pathologists when presented with a metastatic tumour without knowledge of the primary. Surprisingly, adding information on driver mutations reduced classifier accuracy. Our results have immediate clinical applicability, underscoring how patterns of somatic passenger mutations encode the state of the cell of origin, and can inform future strategies to detect the source of cell-free circulating tumour DNA.</p>
