          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Portraits of genetic intra-tumour heterogeneity and subclonal selection across cancer types, bioRxiv, 2018-05-05</h4>
          <p>SummaryOngoing cancer evolution gives rise to intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH), which is a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance and therefore an important clinical challenge. However, the extent, origin and drivers of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. Here, we extensively characterise ITH across 2,778 cancer whole genome sequences from 36 cancer types. We demonstrate that nearly all tumours (94.7%) with sufficient sequencing depth contain evidence of recent subclonal expansions, and that most cancer types show clear signs of positive selection in both clonal and subclonal protein coding variants. We find distinctive subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, fusions, structural variation and copy-number alterations across cancer types. Dynamic, tumour type-specific changes of mutational processes between subclonal expansions shape differences between clonal and subclonal events. Our results underline the importance of ITH and its drivers in tumour evolution, and provide an unprecedented pan-cancer resource of extensively annotated subclonal events, laying a foundation for future cancer genomic studies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Integrating single-cell RNA-Seq with spatial transcriptomics in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using multimodal intersection analysis, bioRxiv, 2018-01-27</h4>
          <p>To understand tissue architecture, it is necessary to understand both which cell types are present and the physical relationships among them. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has made significant progress towards the unbiased and systematic identification of cell populations within a tissue, however, the characterization of their spatial organization within it has been more elusive. The recently introduced ‘spatial transcriptomics’ method (ST) reveals the spatial pattern of gene expression within a tissue section at a resolution of a thousand 100 µm spots across the tissue, each capturing the transcriptomes of multiple cells. Here, we present an approach for the integration of scRNA-Seq and ST data generated from the same sample, and deploy it on primary pancreatic tumors from two patients. Applying our multimodal intersection analysis (MIA), we annotated the distinct micro-environment of each cell type identified by scRNA-Seq. We further found that subpopulations of ductal cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cancer cells have spatially restricted localizations across the tissue, as well as distinct co-enrichments with other cell types. Our mapping approach provides an efficient framework for the integration of the scRNA-Seq-defined subpopulation structure and the ST-defined tissue architecture in any tissue.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Challenges in Using ctDNA to Achieve Early Detection of Cancer, bioRxiv, 2017-12-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractEarly detection of cancer is a significant unmet clinical need. Improved technical ability to detect circulating tumor-derived DNA (ctDNA) in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) component of blood plasma via next-generation sequencing and established correlations between ctDNA load and tumor burden in cancer patients have spurred excitement about the possibilities of detecting cancer early by performing ctDNA mutation detection.We reanalyze published data on the expected ctDNA allele fraction in early-stage cancer and the population statistics of cfDNA concentration to show that under conservative technical assumptions, high-sensitivity cancer detection by ctDNA mutation detection will require either more blood volume (150-300mL) than practical for a routine screen or variant filtering that may be impossible given our knowledge of cancer evolution, and will likely remain out of economic reach for routine population screening without multiple-order-of-magnitude decreases in sequencing cost. Instead, new approaches that integrate ctDNA mutations with multiple other blood-based analytes (such as exosomes, circulating tumor cells, ctDNA epigenetics, metabolites) as well as integration of these signals over time for each individual may be needed.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Candidate cancer driver mutations in superenhancers and long-range chromatin interaction networks, bioRxiv, 2017-12-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractA comprehensive catalogue of the mutations that drive tumorigenesis and progression is essential to understanding tumor biology and developing therapies. Protein-coding driver mutations have been well-characterized by large exome-sequencing studies, however many tumors have no mutations in protein-coding driver genes. Non-coding mutations are thought to explain many of these cases, however few non-coding drivers besides TERT promoter are known. To fill this gap, we analyzed 150,000 cis-regulatory regions in 1,844 whole cancer genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. Using our new method, ActiveDriverWGS, we found 41 frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) enriched in non-coding SNVs and indels (FDR&amp;lt;0.05) characterized by aging-associated mutation signatures and frequent structural variants. Most FMREs are distal from genes, reported here for the first time and also recovered by additional driver discovery methods. FMREs were enriched in super-enhancers, H3K27ac enhancer marks of primary tumors and long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that the mutations drive cancer by distally controlling gene expression through threedimensional genome organization. In support of this hypothesis, the chromatin interaction network of FMREs and target genes revealed associations of mutations and differential gene expression of known and novel cancer genes (e.g., CNNB1IP1, RCC1), activation of immune response pathways and altered enhancer marks. Thus distal genomic regions may include additional, infrequently mutated drivers that act on target genes via chromatin loops. Our study is an important step towards finding such regulatory regions and deciphering the somatic mutation landscape of the non-coding genome.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A deep learning system can accurately classify primary and metastatic cancers based on patterns of passenger mutations, bioRxiv, 2017-11-06</h4>
          <p>In cancer, the primary tumour&#39;s organ of origin and histopathology are the strongest determinants of its clinical behaviour, but in 3% of the time a cancer patient presents with metastatic tumour and no obvious primary. Challenges also arise when distinguishing a metastatic recurrence of a previously treated cancer from the emergence of a new one. Here we train a deep learning classifier to predict cancer type based on patterns of somatic passenger mutations detected in whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 2606 tumours representing 24 common cancer types. Our classifier achieves an accuracy of 91% on held-out tumor samples  and 82% and 85% respectively on independent primary and metastatic samples, roughly double the accuracy of trained pathologists when presented with a metastatic tumour without knowledge of the primary. Surprisingly, adding information on driver mutations reduced classifier accuracy. Our results have immediate clinical applicability, underscoring how patterns of somatic passenger mutations encode the state of the cell of origin, and can inform future strategies to detect the source of cell-free circulating tumour DNA.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The whole-genome panorama of cancer drivers, bioRxiv, 2017-09-21</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYThe advance of personalized cancer medicine requires the accurate identification of the mutations driving each patient’s tumor. However, to date, we have only been able to obtain partial insights into the contribution of genomic events to tumor development. Here, we design a comprehensive approach to identify the driver mutations in each patient’s tumor and obtain a whole-genome panorama of driver events across more than 2,500 tumors from 37 types of cancer. This panorama includes coding and non-coding point mutations, copy number alterations and other genomic rearrangements of somatic origin, and potentially predisposing germline variants. We demonstrate that genomic events are at the root of virtually all tumors, with each carrying on average 4.6 driver events. Most individual tumors harbor a unique combination of drivers, and we uncover the most frequent co-occurring driver events. Half of all cancer genes are affected by several types of driver mutations. In summary, the panorama described here provides answers to fundamental questions in cancer genomics and bridges the gap between cancer genomics and personalized cancer medicine.</p>
