          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Patterns of structural variation in human cancer, bioRxiv, 2017-08-28</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTA key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments ranging in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes. We developed methods to group, classify and describe structural variants, applied to &amp;gt;2,500 cancer genomes. Nine signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such ‘cycles of templated insertions’ correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer. Cancers access many rearrangement processes, flexibly sculpting the genome to maximise oncogenic potential.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pan-cancer analysis of whole genomes, bioRxiv, 2017-07-13</h4>
          <p>We report the integrative analysis of more than 2,600 whole cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 39 distinct tumour types. By studying whole genomes we have been able to catalogue non-coding cancer driver events, study patterns of structural variation, infer tumour evolution, probe the interactions among variants in the germline genome, the tumour genome and the transcriptome, and derive an understanding of how coding and non-coding variations together contribute to driving individual patient&#39;s tumours. This work represents the most comprehensive look at cancer whole genomes to date. NOTE TO READERS This is an incomplete draft of the marker paper for the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes Project, and is intended to provide the background information for a series of in-depth papers that will be posted to BioRixv during the summer of 2017.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The evolutionary history of 2,658 cancers, bioRxiv, 2017-07-12</h4>
          <p>SummaryCancer develops through a process of somatic evolution. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 2,778 tumour samples from 2,658 donors to reconstruct the life history, evolution of mutational processes, and driver mutation sequences of 39 cancer types. The early phases of oncogenesis are driven by point mutations in a small set of driver genes, often including biallelic inactivation of tumour suppressors. Early oncogenesis is also characterised by specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma or isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. By contrast, increased genomic instability, a nearly four-fold diversification of driver genes, and an acceleration of point mutation processes are features of later stages. Copy-number alterations often occur in mitotic crises leading to simultaneous gains of multiple chromosomal segments. Timing analysis suggests that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, and in some cases decades, providing a window of opportunity for early cancer detection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A simple high-throughput approach identifies actionable drug sensitivities in patient-derived tumor organoids, bioRxiv, 2017-06-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is increasing interest in developing 3D tumor organoid models for drug development and personalized medicine applications. While tumor organoids are in principle amenable to high-throughput drug screenings, progress has been hampered by technical constraints and extensive manipulations required by current methodologies. Here, we introduce a miniaturized, fully automatable, flexible high-throughput method using a simplified geometry to rapidly establish 3D organoids from cell lines and primary tissue and robustly assay drug responses. As proof of principle, we use our miniring approach to establish organoids of high-grade serous tumors and one carcinosarcoma of the ovaries and screen hundreds of protein kinase compounds currently FDA-approved or in clinical development. In all cases we could identify drugs causing significant reduction in cell viability, number and size of organoids within a week from surgery, a timeline compatible with therapeutic decision making.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Report of Partial Findings from the National Toxicology Program Carcinogenesis Studies of Cell Phone Radiofrequency Radiation in Hsd Sprague Dawley® Sd Rats (Whole Body Exposure), bioRxiv, 2016-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) has carried out extensive rodent toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) at frequencies and modulations used in the U.S. telecommunications industry. This report presents partial findings from these studies. The occurrences of two tumor types in male Harlan Sprague Dawley rats exposed to RFR, malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas of the heart, were considered of particular interest and are the subject of this report. The findings in this report were reviewed by expert peer reviewers selected by the NTP and National Institutes of Health (NIH). These reviews and responses to comments are included as appendices to this report, and revisions to the current document have incorporated and addressed these comments. When the studies are completed, they will undergo additional peer review before publication in full as part of the NTP&#39;s Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Technical Reports Series. No portion of this work has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal. Supplemental information in the form of four additional manuscripts has or will soon be submitted for publication. These manuscripts describe in detail the designs and performance of the RFR exposure system, the dosimetry of RFR exposures in rats and mice, the results to a series of pilot studies establishing the ability of the animals to thermoregulate during RFR exposures, and studies of DNA damage.

Evaluation of the genotoxicity of cell phone radiofrequency radiation in male and female rats and mice following subchronic exposure.SUMMARYThe purpose of this communication is to report partial findings from a series of radiofrequency radiation (RFR) cancer studies in rats performed under the auspices of the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP).1 This report contains peer-reviewed, neoplastic and hyperplastic findings only in the brain and heart of HsdSprague Dawley® SD® (HSD) rats exposed to RFR starting in utero and continuing throughout their lifetimes. These studies found low incidences of malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.The review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies. Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.2It is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and is not a complete report of all findings from the NTP’s studies. Additional data from these studies in HsdSprague Dawley® SD® (Harlan) rats and similar studies conducted in B6C3F1N mice are currently under evaluation and will be reported together with the current findings in two forthcoming NTP Technical Reports.</p>
