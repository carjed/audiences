          <p>AbstractDecoding the functional connectivity of the nervous system is facilitated by transgenic methods that express a genetically encoded reporter or effector in specific neurons; however, most transgenic lines show broad spatiotemporal and cell-type expression. Increased specificity can be achieved using intersectional genetic methods which restrict reporter expression to cells that co-express multiple drivers, such as Gal4 and Cre. To facilitate intersectional targeting in zebrafish, we have generated more than 50 new Cre lines, and co-registered brain expression images with the Zebrafish Brain Browser, a cellular resolution atlas of 264 transgenic lines. Lines labeling neurons of interest can be identified using a web-browser to perform a 3D spatial search (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpzbbrowser.com&gt;zbbrowser.com&lt;jatsext-link&gt;). This resource facilitates the design of intersectional genetic experiments and will advance a wide range of precision circuit-mapping studies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Harnessing the Anti-Cancer Natural Product Nimbolide for Targeted Protein Degradation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractNimbolide, a terpenoid natural product derived from the Neem tree, impairs cancer pathogenicity across many types of human cancers; however, the direct targets and mechanisms by which nimbolide exerts its effects are poorly understood. Here, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) chemoproteomic platforms to discover that nimbolide reacts with a novel functional cysteine crucial for substrate recognition in the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114. Nimbolide impairs breast cancer cell proliferation in-part by disrupting RNF114 substrate recognition, leading to inhibition of ubiquitination and degradation of the tumor-suppressors such as p21, resulting in their rapid stabilization. We further demonstrate that nimbolide can be harnessed to recruit RNF114 as an E3 ligase in targeted protein degradation applications and show that synthetically simpler scaffolds are also capable of accessing this unique reactive site. Our study highlights the utility of ABPP platforms in uncovering unique druggable modalities accessed by natural products for cancer therapy and targeted protein degradation applications.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The whale shark genome reveals how genomic and physiological properties scale with body size, bioRxiv, 2018-10-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe endangered whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest fish on Earth and is a long-lived member of the ancient Elasmobranchii clade. To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 81 animals and yeast. We examined scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic features also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture GC content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with lifespan. Among these were very long gene length, due to large introns highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like LINEs, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale shark’s genome had an expansion of gene families related to fatty acid metabolism and neurogenesis, with the slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan, and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Centrosome-nuclear envelope tethering and microtubule motor-based pulling forces collaborate in centrosome positioning during mitotic entry, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13</h4>
          <p>Centrosome positioning relative to the nucleus and cell shape is highly regulated across cell types, during cell migration and during spindle formation in cell division. Across most sexually reproducing animals, centrosomes are provided to the oocyte through fertilization and must be positioned properly to establish the zygotic mitotic spindle. How centrosomes are positioned in space and time through the concerted action of key mitotic entry biochemical regulators including Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A-B55SUR-6), biophysical regulators including Dynein and the nuclear lamina is unclear. Here, we uncover a role for PP2A-B55SUR-6 in regulating centrosome positioning. Mechanistically, PP2A-B55SUR-6 regulates nuclear size prior to mitotic entry, in turn affecting nuclear envelope-based Dynein density and motor capacity. Using computational simulations, PP2A-B55 SUR-6 regulation of nuclear size and nuclear envelope Dynein density were both predicted to be required for proper centrosome positioning. Conversely, compromising nuclear lamina integrity led to centrosome detachment from the nuclear envelope and migration defects. Removal of PP2A-B55SUR-6 and the nuclear lamina simultaneously further disrupted centrosome positioning, leading to unseparated centrosome pairs dissociated from the nuclear envelope. Taken together, we propose a model in which centrosomes migrate and are positioned through the concerted action of nuclear envelope-based Dynein pulling forces and cen-trosome-nuclear envelope tethering.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring the average power of neural oscillations, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundNeural oscillations are often quantified as average power relative to a cognitive, perceptual, andor behavioral task. This is commonly done using Fourier-based techniques, such as Welch’s method for estimating the power spectral density, andor by estimating narrowband oscillatory power across trials, conditions, andor groups. The core assumption underlying these approaches is that the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency. Despite the importance of this assumption, it has not been rigorously tested.New methodWe introduce extensions of common approaches that are better suited for the physiological reality of how neural oscillations often manifest as nonstationary, high-power bursts, rather than sustained rhythms. Log-transforming, or taking the median power, significantly reduces erroneously inflated power estimates.ResultsAnalyzing 101 participants’ worth of human electrophysiology, totaling 3,560 channels and over 40 hours data, we show that, in all cases examined, spectral power is not Gaussian distributed. This is true even when oscillations are prominent and sustained, such as visual cortical alpha. Power across time, at every frequency, is characterized by a substantial long tail, which implies that estimates of average power are skewed toward large, infrequent high-power oscillatory bursts.Comparison with existing methodsIn a simulated event-related experiment we show how introducing just a few high-power oscillatory bursts, as seen in real data, can, perhaps erroneously, cause significant differences between conditions using traditional methods. These erroneous effects are substantially reduced with our new methods.ConclusionsThese results call into question the validity of common statistical practices in neural oscillation research.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Analyses of oscillatory power often assume power is normally distributed.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Analyzing &amp;gt;40 hours of human MEEG and ECoG, we show that in all cases it is not.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;This effect is demonstrated in simple simulation of an event-related task.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Overinflated power estimates are reduced via log-transformation or median power.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Principles of Meiotic Chromosome Assembly, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13</h4>
          <p>During meiotic prophase, chromosomes organise into a series of chromatin loops emanating from a proteinaceous axis, but the mechanisms of assembly remain unclear. Here we elucidate how this elaborate three-dimensional chromosome organisation is underpinned by genomic sequence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Entering meiosis, strong cohesin-dependent grid-like Hi-C interaction patterns emerge, reminiscent of mammalian interphase organisation, but with distinct regulation. Meiotic patterns agree with simulations of loop extrusion limited by barriers, yet are patterned by convergent transcription rather than binding of the mammalian interphase factor, CTCF, which is absent in S. cerevisiae - thereby both challenging and extending current paradigms of local chromosome organisation. While grid-like interactions emerge independently of meiotic chromosome synapsis, synapsis itself generates additional compaction that matures differentially according to telomere proximity and chromosome size. Collectively, our results elucidate fundamental principles of chromosome assembly and demonstrate the essential role of cohesin within this evolutionarily conserved process.</p>
