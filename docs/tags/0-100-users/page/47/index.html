          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Active and repressed chromatin domains exhibit distinct nucleosome segregation during DNA replication, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryChromatin domains and their associated structures must be faithfully inherited through cellular division to maintain cellular identity. Yet, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) during DNA replication is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at single desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells such that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through the local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment in the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Alcohol consumption and mate choice in UK Biobank comparing observational and Mendelian randomization estimates, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlcohol use is correlated within spouse-pairs, but it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol consumption on mate-selection from social factors or cohabitation leading to spouses becoming more similar over time. We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection.Therefore, in a sample of over 47,000 spouse-pairs in the UK Biobank we utilised a well-characterised alcohol related variant, rs1229984 in ADH1B, as a genetic proxy for alcohol use. We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individual’s self-reported alcohol use and their partner’s rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.We found strong evidence that both an individual’s self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partner’s self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individual’s weekly alcohol consumption increased their partner’s alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10×10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation. Although the SNP is strongly associated with ancestry, our results suggest that this concordance is unlikely to be explained by population stratification. Overall, our findings suggest that alcohol behaviour directly influences mate selection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Co-option and Detoxification of a Phage Lysin for Housekeeping Function, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryTemperate phages constitute a potentially beneficial genetic reservoir for bacterial innovation despite being selfish entities encoding an infection cycle inherently at odds with bacterial fitness. These phages integrate their genomes into the bacterial host during infection, donating new, but deleterious, genetic material the phage genome encodes toxic genes, such as lysins, that kill the bacterium during the phage infection cycle. Remarkably, some bacteria have exploited the destructive properties of phage genes for their own benefit by co-opting them as toxins for functions related to bacterial warfare, virulence, and secretion. However, do toxic phage genes ever become raw material for functional innovation? Here we report on a toxic phage gene whose product has lost its toxicity and has become a domain of a core cellular factor, SpmX, throughout the bacterial order Caulobacterales. Using a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, structural biology, cell biology, and biochemistry, we have investigated the origin and function of SpmX and determined that its occurrence is the result of the detoxification of a phage peptidoglycan hydrolase gene. We show that the retained, attenuated activity of the phage-derived domain plays an important role in proper cell morphology and developmental regulation in representatives of this large bacterial clade. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of phage gene domestication in which a toxic phage gene has been co-opted for a housekeeping function.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The landscape of somatic mutation in normal colorectal epithelial cells, bioRxiv, 2018-09-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe colorectal adenoma-carcinoma sequence has provided a paradigmatic framework for understanding the successive somatic genetic changes and consequent clonal expansions leading to cancer. As for most cancer types, however, understanding of the earliest phases of colorectal neoplastic change, which may occur in morphologically normal tissue, is comparatively limited because of the difficulty of detecting somatic mutations in normal cells. Each colorectal crypt is a small clone of cells derived from a single recently-existing stem cell. Here, we whole genome sequenced hundreds of normal crypts from 42 individuals. Signatures of multiple mutational processes were revealed, some ubiquitous and continuous, others only found in some individuals, in some crypts or during some phases of the cell lineage from zygote to adult cell. Likely driver mutations were present in ∼1% of normal colorectal crypts in middle-aged individuals, indicating that adenomas and carcinomas are rare outcomes of a pervasive process of neoplastic change across morphologically normal colorectal epithelium.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transient intracellular acidification regulates the core transcriptional heat shock response, bioRxiv, 2018-09-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractCellular stress induces rapid expression of genes encoding molecular chaperones. In many eukaryotes, stress also triggers transient intracellular acidification which, by unknown mechanisms, is associated with increased survival. Here, using budding yeast as a model, we discover that preventing cells from transiently acidifying during heat shock compromises induction of molecular chaperones and fitness. Prevention of acidification during stress and recovery silences induction of a canonical heat-shock protein altogether. The association between acidification, induction, and growth holds at the population and single-cell levels. Hinting at the molecular basis of these effects, the failure to acidify specifically suppresses induction of genes regulated by the conserved heat shock transcription factor Hsf1. Our results establish a central role for intracellular pH in the eukaryotic transcriptional stress response, and implicate pH-sensitive stress-sensing proteins, rather than misfolded proteins, in the activation of Hsf1 under physiological heat shock conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A data-driven approach to the automated study of cross-species homologies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractBehavioral neuroscience has made great strides in developing animal models of human behavior and psychiatric disorders. Animal models allow for the formulation of hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, and the opportunity to test these hypotheses using procedures that are too invasive for human participants. However, recent scientific reviews have highlighted the low success rate of translating results from animal models into clinical interventions in humans. A potential roadblock is that bidirectional functional mappings between the human and rodent brain are incomplete. To narrow this gap, we created a framework, Neurobabel, for performing large-scale automated synthesis of human neuroimaging data and behavioral neuroscience data. By leveraging the semantics of how researchers within each field describe their studies, this framework enables region to region mapping of brain regions across species, as well as cross-species mapping of psychological functions. As a proof of concept, we utilize the framework to create a functional cross-species mapping between the amygdala and hippocampus for fear-related and spatial memories, respectively. We then proceed to address two open questions in the field (1) Do rodents have a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? (2) Which human brain region corresponds to the rodent prelimbic cortex?</p>
