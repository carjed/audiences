          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Polygenic Adaptation From sweeps to subtle frequency shifts, bioRxiv, 2018-10-23</h4>
          <p>Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis. The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a single compound parameter, the population-scaled background mutation rate Θbg, explains the main differences among these patterns. For a focal locus, Θbg measures the mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation proceeds by sweeps for small Θbg ≲0.1, while small polygenic allele frequency shifts require large Θbg ≳100. In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Adding function to the genome of African Salmonella ST313, bioRxiv, 2018-10-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractSalmonella Typhimurium ST313 causes invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, targeting susceptible HIV&#43;, malarial or malnourished individuals. An in-depth genomic comparison between the ST313 isolate D23580, and the well-characterized ST19 isolate 474 that causes gastroenteritis across the globe, revealed extensive synteny. To understand how the 856 nucleotide variations generated phenotypic differences, we devised a large-scale experimental approach that involved the global gene expression analysis of strains D23580 and 474 grown in sixteen infection-relevant growth conditions. Comparison of transcriptional patterns identified virulence and metabolic genes that were differentially expressed between D23580 versus 474, many of which were validated by proteomics. We also uncovered the S. Typhimurium D23580 and 474 genes that showed expression differences during infection of murine macrophages. Our comparative transcriptomic data are presented in a new enhanced version of the Salmonella expression compendium SalComD23580 &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpbioinf.gen.tcd.iecgi-binsalcom_v2.pl&gt;bioinf.gen.tcd.iecgi-binsalcom_v2.pl&lt;jatsext-link&gt;. We discovered that the ablation of melibiose utilization was caused by 3 independent SNP mutations in D23580 that are shared across ST313 lineage 2, suggesting that the ability to catabolise this carbon source has been negatively selected during ST313 evolution. The data revealed a novel plasmid maintenance system involving a plasmid-encoded CysS cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, highlighting the power of large-scale comparative multi-condition analyses to pinpoint key phenotypic differences between bacterial pathovariants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Navigome Navigating the Human Phenome, bioRxiv, 2018-10-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe now have access to a sufficient number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to cluster phenotypes into genetic-informed categories and to navigate the “phenome” space of human traits. Using a collection of 465 GWAS, we generated genetic correlations, pathways, gene-wise and tissue-wise associations using MAGMA and S-PrediXcan for 465 human traits. Testing 7267 biological pathways, we found that only 898 were significantly associated with any trait. Similarly, out of ~20,000 tested protein-coding genes, 12,311 genes exhibited an association. Based on the genetic correlations between all traits, we constructed a phenome map using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), where each of the 465 traits can be visualized as an individual point. This map reveals well-defined clusters of traits such as educationhigh longevity, lower longevity, height, body composition, and depressionanxietyneuroticism. These clusters are enriched in specific groups of pathways, such as lipid pathways in the lower longevity cluster, and neuronal pathways for body composition or education clusters. The map and all other analyses are available in the Navigome web interface (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsphenviz.navigome.com&gt;httpsphenviz.navigome.com&lt;jatsext-link&gt;).</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Predicting the Future with Multi-scale Successor Representations, bioRxiv, 2018-10-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe successor representation (SR) is a candidate principle for generalization in reinforcement learning, computational accounts of memory, and the structure of neural representations in the hippocampus. Given a sequence of states, the SR learns a predictive representation for every given state that encodes how often, on average, each upcoming state is expected to be visited, even if it is multiple steps ahead. A discount or scale parameter determines how many steps into the future SR’s generalizations reach, enabling rapid value computation, subgoal discovery, and flexible decision-making in large trees. However, SR with a single scale could discard information for predicting both the sequential order of and the distance between states, which are common problems in navigation for animals and artificial agents. Here we propose a solution an ensemble of SRs with multiple scales. We show that the derivative of multi-scale SR can reconstruct both the sequence of expected future states and estimate distance to goal. This derivative can be computed linearly we show that a multi-scale SR ensemble is the Laplace transform of future states, and the inverse of this Laplace transform is a biologically plausible linear estimation of the derivative. Multi-scale SR and its derivative could lead to a common principle for how the medial temporal lobe supports both map-based and vector-based navigation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from Alpha-band Activity in the Human Brain, bioRxiv, 2018-10-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractMagnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response is associated with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli. Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to the dynamic components and axial alignment of the field but also to the static components and polarity of the field. This pattern of results implicates ferromagnetism as the biophysical basis for the sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transposon accumulation lines uncover histone H2A.Z-driven integration bias towards environmentally responsive genes, bioRxiv, 2018-10-19</h4>
          <p>Inherited transposition events are important drivers of genome evolution but because transposable element (TE) mobilization is usually rare, its impact on the creation of genetic variation remains poorly characterized. Here, we used a population of A. thaliana epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) to characterize &amp;gt;8000 de novo insertions produced by several TEs families also active in nature. Integration was strongly biased towards genes, with evident deleterious effects. Biases were TE family-specific and associated with distinct chromatin features. Notably, we demonstrate that the histone variant H2A.Z guides the preferential integration of Ty1Copia LTR-retrotransposons within environmentally responsive genes and that this guiding function is evolutionary conserved. Finally, we uncover an important role for epigenetic silencing in exacerbating or alleviating the effects of TE insertions on target genes. These findings establish chromatin as a major determinant of the spectrum and functional impact of TE-generated mutations, with important implications for adaptation and evolution.</p>
