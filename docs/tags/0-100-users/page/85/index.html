          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Graph theory approaches to functional network organization in brain disorders A critique for a brave new small-world, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractOver the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods have provided new insights into the network organization of the human brain. Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Protein-coding variation and introgression of regulatory alleles drive plumage pattern diversity in the rock pigeon, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBirds and other vertebrates display stunning variation in pigmentation patterning, yet the genes controlling this diversity remain largely unknown. Rock pigeons (Columba livia) are fundamentally one of four color pattern phenotypes, in decreasing order of melanism T-check, checker, bar (ancestral), or barless. Using whole-genome scans, we identified NDP as a candidate gene for this variation. Allele-specific expression differences in NDP indicate cis-regulatory differences between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), providing a striking example of introgression of alleles that are favored by breeders and are potentially advantageous in the wild. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like two human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in NDP. In summary, we find unexpected links between color pattern, introgression, and vision defects associated with regulatory and coding variation at a single locus.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Defects in the neuroendocrine axis cause global development delay in a Drosophila model of NGLY1 Deficiency, bioRxiv, 2018-01-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTN-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) Deficiency is a rare monogenic multi-system disorder first described in 2014. NGLY1 is evolutionarily conserved in model organisms, including the Drosophila melanogaster NGLY1 homolog, Pngl. Here we conducted a natural history study and chemical-modifier screen on a new fly model of NGLY1 Deficiency engineered with a nonsense mutation in Pngl at codon 420, resulting in truncation of the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding PAW domain. Homozygous mutant animals exhibit global development delay, pupal lethality and small body size as adults. We developed a 96-well-plate, image-based, quantitative assay of Drosophila larval size for use in a screen of the 2,650-member Microsource Spectrum compound library of FDA approved drugs, bioactive tool compounds, and natural products. We found that the cholesterol-derived ecdysteroid molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) rescued the global developmental delay in mutant homozygotes. Targeted expression of a human NGLY1 transgene to tissues involved in ecdysteroidogenesis, e.g., prothoracic gland, also rescues global developmental delay in mutant homozygotes. Finally, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a potent enhancer of global developmental delay in our fly model, evidence of a defective proteasome “bounce-back” response that is also observed in nematode and cellular models of NGLY1 Deficiency. Together, these results demonstrate the therapeutic relevance of a new fly model of NGLY1 Deficiency for drug discovery, biomarker discovery, pharmacodynamics studies, and gene modifier screens.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comparison of computational methods for imputing single-cell RNA-sequencing data, bioRxiv, 2018-01-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a recent breakthrough technology, which paves the way for measuring RNA levels at single cell resolution to study precise biological functions. One of the main challenges when analyzing scRNA-seq data is the presence of zeros or dropout events, which may mislead downstream analyses. To compensate the dropout effect, several methods have been developed to impute gene expression since the first Bayesian-based method being proposed in 2016. However, these methods have shown very diverse characteristics in terms of model hypothesis and imputation performance. Thus, large-scale comparison and evaluation of these methods is urgently needed now. To this end, we compared eight imputation methods, evaluated their power in recovering original real data, and performed broad analyses to explore their effects on clustering cell types, detecting differentially expressed genes, and reconstructing lineage trajectories in the context of both simulated and real data. Simulated datasets and case studies highlight that there are no one method performs the best in all the situations. Some defects of these methods such as scalability, robustness and unavailability in some situations need to be addressed in future studies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DeepGS Predicting phenotypes from genotypes using Deep Learning, bioRxiv, 2018-01-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractMotivationGenomic selection (GS) is a new breeding strategy by which the phenotypes of quantitative traits are usually predicted based on genome-wide markers of genotypes using conventional statistical models. However, the GS prediction models typically make strong assumptions and perform linear regression analysis, limiting their accuracies since they do not capture the complex, non-linear relationships within genotypes, and between genotypes and phenotypes.ResultsWe present a deep learning method, named DeepGS, to predict phenotypes from genotypes. Using a deep convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypic markers when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling and dropout strategies to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional marker data. We used a large GS dataset to train DeepGS and compare its performance with other methods. In terms of mean normalized discounted cumulative gain value, DeepGS achieves an increase of 27.70%~246.34% over a conventional neural network in selecting top-ranked 1% individuals with high phenotypic values for the eight tested traits. Additionally, compared with the widely used method RR-BLUP, DeepGS still yields a relative improvement ranging from 1.44% to 65.24%. Through extensive simulation experiments, we also demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of DeepGS for the absent of outlier individuals and subsets of genotypic markers. Finally, we illustrated the complementarity of DeepGS and RR-BLUP with an ensemble learning approach for further improving prediction performance.AvailabilityDeepGS is provided as an open source R package available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comcma2015DeepGS&gt;httpsgithub.comcma2015DeepGS&lt;jatsext-link&gt;.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Functional False Discovery Rate with Applications to Genomics, bioRxiv, 2017-12-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe false discovery rate measures the proportion of false discoveries among a set of hypothesis tests called significant. This quantity is typically estimated based on p-values or test statistics. In some scenarios, there is additional information available that may be used to more accurately estimate the false discovery rate. We develop a new framework for formulating and estimating false discovery rates and q-values when an additional piece of information, which we call an “informative variable”, is available. For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The false discovery rate is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.</p>
