          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A risk-reward tradeoff of high ribosome production in proliferating cells, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo achieve maximal growth, cells must manage a massive economy of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and RNAs (rRNAs), which are required to produce thousands of new ribosomes every minute. Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we modeled these perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result immediately in acute loss of proteostasis (protein folding homeostasis). Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes. In response, proteostasis genes are activated by an Hsf1-dependent stress response pathway that is required for recovery from r-protein assembly stress. Importantly, we show that exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. Our results highlight ribosome assembly as a linchpin of cellular homeostasis, representing a key proteostasis vulnerability for rapidly proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic conditions that generate orphan r-proteins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Immediate visualization of recombination events and chromosome segregation defects in fission yeast meiosis, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractSchizosaccharomyces pombe, also known as fission yeast, is an established model for studying chromosome biological processes. Over the years research employing fission yeast has made important contributions to our knowledge about chromosome segregation during meiosis, as well as meiotic recombination and its regulation. Quantification of meiotic recombination frequency is not a straightforward undertaking, either requiring viable progeny for a genetic plating assay, or relying on laborious Southern blot analysis of recombination intermediates. Neither of these methods lends itself to high-throughput screens to identify novel meiotic factors. Here, we establish visual assays novel to Sz. pombe for characterizing chromosome segregation and meiotic recombination phenotypes. Genes expressing red, yellow, andor cyan fluorophores from spore-autonomous promoters have been integrated into the fission yeast genomes, either close to the centromere of chromosome I to monitor chromosome segregation, or on the arm of chromosome III to form a genetic interval at which recombination frequency can be determined. The visual recombination assay allows straightforward and immediate assessment of the genetic outcome of a single meiosis by epi-fluorescence microscopy without requiring tetrad dissection. We also demonstrate that the recombination frequency analysis can be automatized by utilizing imaging flow cytometry to enable high-throughput screens. These assays have several advantages over traditional methods for analysing meiotic phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The emergence of multiple retinal cell types through efficient coding of natural movies, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractOne of the most striking aspects of early visual processing in the retina is the immediate parcellation of visual information into multiple parallel pathways, formed by different retinal ganglion cell types each tiling the entire visual field. Existing theories of efficient coding have been unable to account for the functional advantages of such cell-type diversity in encoding natural scenes. Here we go beyond previous theories to analyze how a simple linear retinal encoding model with different convolutional cell types efficiently encodes naturalistic spatiotemporal movies given a fixed firing rate budget. We find that optimizing the receptive fields and cell densities of two cell types makes them match the properties of the two main cell types in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells, in terms of spatial and temporal sensitivity, cell spacing, and their relative ratio. Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types. Thus our work provides a theoretical justification, based on the efficient coding of natural movies, for the existence of the four most dominant cell types in the primate retina that together comprise 70% of all ganglion cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Specialized and spatially organized coding of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables in midbrain dopamine neurons, bioRxiv, 2018-10-29</h4>
          <p>There is increased appreciation that dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward 1,2 and reward-predicting cues 1,3,4, but also to other variables such as distance to reward 5, movements 6–11 and behavioral choices 12–15. Based on these findings, a major open question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of DA neurons. In other words, do individual DA neurons multiplex multiple variables, or are subsets of neurons specialized in encoding specific behavioral variables? The reason that this fundamental question has been difficult to resolve is that recordings from large populations of individual DA neurons have not been performed in a behavioral task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we used 2-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record activity of &amp;gt;300 midbrain DA neurons in the VTA during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual reality (VR) environment, DA neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioral variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, such that neighboring neurons were more likely to be part of the same cluster. Taken together with the topography between DA neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by DA neurons.</p>

          <p>AbstractThree-dimensional electron microscopy techniques like electron tomography provide valuable insights into cellular structures, and present significant challenges for data storage and dissemination. Here we explored a novel method to publicly release more than 11,000 such datasets, more than 30 TB in total, collected by our group. Our method, based on a peer-to-peer file sharing network built around a blockchain ledger, offers a distributed solution to data storage. In addition, we offer a user-friendly browser-based interface, &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsetdb.caltech.edu&gt;httpsetdb.caltech.edu&lt;jatsext-link&gt;, for anyone interested to explore and download our data. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of this system and provide tools for other groups to mine our data andor use the same approach to share their own imaging datasets.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inference of recombination maps from a single pair of genomes and its application to archaic samples, bioRxiv, 2018-10-25</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTUnderstanding the causes and consequences of recombination rate evolution is a fundamental goal in genetics that requires recombination maps from across the tree of life. Since statistical inference of recombination maps typically depends on large samples, reaching out studies to non-model organisms requires alternative tools. Here we extend the sequentially Markovian coalescent model to jointly infer demography and the variation in recombination along a pair of genomes. Using extensive simulations and sequence data from humans, fruit-flies and a fungal pathogen, we demonstrate that iSMC accurately infers recombination maps under a wide range of scenarios – remarkably, even from a single pair of unphased genomes. We exploit this possibility and reconstruct the recombination maps of archaic hominids. We report that the evolution of the recombination landscape follows the established phylogeny of Neandertals, Denisovans and modern human populations, as expected if the genomic distribution of crossovers in hominids is largely neutral.</p>
