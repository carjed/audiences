          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assignment of virus and antimicrobial resistance genes to microbial hosts in a complex microbial community by combined long-read assembly and proximity ligation, bioRxiv, 2018-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe characterization of microbial communities by metagenomic approaches has been enhanced by recent improvements in short-read sequencing efficiency and assembly algorithms. We describe the results of adding long-read sequencing to the mix of technologies used to assemble a highly complex cattle rumen microbial community, and compare the assembly to current short read-based methods applied to the same sample. Contigs in the long-read assembly were 7-fold longer on average, and contained 7-fold more complete open reading frames (ORF), than the short read assembly, despite having three-fold lower sequence depth. The linkages between long-read contigs, provided by proximity ligation data, supported identification of 188 novel viral-host associations in the rumen microbial community that suggest cross-species infectivity of specific viral strains. The improved contiguity of the long-read assembly also identified 94 antimicrobial resistance genes, compared to only seven alleles identified in the short-read assembly. Overall, we demonstrate a combination of experimental and computational methods that work synergistically to improve characterization of biological features in a highly complex rumen microbial community.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Atomic Level Characterisation of Millisecond-Time Scale Protein Motions through a Combined Molecular Simulations and NMR Approach, bioRxiv, 2018-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractAdvances in biomolecular sciences are closely linked to our ability to chart the energy landscapes of biomolecules with atomic details. Here we validate a new paradigm to characterise thermodynamics and kinetics of millisecond timescale conformational transitions between ground state and transient excited states in the enzyme cyclophilin A (CypA). We describe a novel methodology that combines molecular dynamics simulations and Markov State modelling with NMR measurements to provide atomic-level insights into the nature of CypA transient conformational states. The computed conformational ensembles also enabled the predictive design and experimental validation of a single-site mutant that dramatically perturbs millisecond timescale loop motions, converting a CypA excited state into the ground state. The resulting models open up new horizons for targeting CypA with inhibitors and pave the way towards rational design of protein energy landscapes for protein engineering and drug discovery purposes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Dynamic design manipulation of millisecond timescale motions on the energy landscape of Cyclophilin A, bioRxiv, 2018-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractProteins need to interconvert between many conformations in order to function, many of which are formed transiently, and sparsely populated. Particularly when the lifetimes of these states approach the millisecond timescale, identifying the relevant structures and the mechanism by which they inter-convert remains a tremendous challenge. Here we introduce a novel combination of accelerated MD (aMD) simulations and Markov State modelling (MSM) to explore these ‘excited’ conformational states. Applying this to the highly dynamic protein CypA, a protein involved in immune response and associated with HIV infection, we identify five principally populated conformational states and the atomistic mechanism by which they interconvert. A rational design strategy predicted that the mutant D66A should stabilise the minor conformations and substantially alter the dynamics whereas the similar mutant H70A should leave the landscape broadly unchanged. These predictions are confirmed using CPMG and R1ρ solution state NMR measurements. By accurately and reliably exploring functionally relevant, but sparsely populated conformations with milli-second lifetimes in silico, our aMDMSM method has tremendous promise for the design of dynamic protein free energy landscapes for both protein engineering and drug discovery.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Chemogenetic ligands for translational neurotheranostics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractDesigner Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) are a popular chemogenetic technology for manipulation of neuronal activity in uninstrumented awake animals with potential for precision medicine-based clinical theranostics. DREADD ligands developed to date are not appropriate for such translational applications. The prototypical DREADD agonist clozapine N-oxide (CNO) lacks brain entry and converts to clozapine. The second-generation DREADD agonist, Compound 21 (C21), was developed to overcome these limitations. We found that C21 has low brain penetrance, weak affinity, and low in vivo DREADD occupancy. To address these drawbacks, we developed two new DREADD agonists, JHU37152 and JHU37160, and the first dedicated positron emission tomography (PET) DREADD radiotracer, [18F]JHU37107. JHU37152 and JHU37160 exhibit high in vivo DREADD potency. [18F]JHU37107 combined with PET allows for DREADD detection in locally-targeted neurons and at their long-range projections, enabling for the first time, noninvasive and longitudinal neuronal projection mapping and potential for neurotheranostic applications.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A comparison of gene expression and DNA methylation patterns across tissues and species, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractPreviously published comparative functional genomic data sets from primates using frozen tissue samples, including many data sets from our own group, were collected and analyzed using non-optimal study designs and analysis approaches. In addition, when samples from multiple tissues were studied in a comparative framework, individual and tissue were confounded. We designed a multi-tissue comparative study of gene expression and DNA methylation in primates that minimizes confounding effects by using a balanced design with respect to species, tissues, and individuals. We also developed a comparative analysis pipeline that minimizes biases due to sequence divergence. We thus present the most comprehensive catalog of similarities and differences in gene expression and methylation levels between livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs, in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We estimate that overall, only between 7 to 11% (depending on the tissue) of inter-species differences in gene expression levels can be accounted for by corresponding differences in promoter DNA methylation. However, gene expression divergence in conserved tissue-specific genes can be explained by corresponding inter-species methylation changes more often. We end the paper by providing recommendations for effective study design and best practices for meta-data recording for comparative functional genomic studies in primates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Natural selection contributed to immunological differences between human hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe shift from a hunter-gatherer (HG) to an agricultural (AG) mode of subsistence is believed to have been associated with profound changes in the burden and diversity of pathogens across human populations. Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture may have impacted the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers. This result is counter to expectations based on the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.</p>
