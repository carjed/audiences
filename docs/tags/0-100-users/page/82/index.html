          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Why should mitochondria define species?, bioRxiv, 2018-03-08</h4>
          <p>More than a decade of DNA barcoding encompassing about five million specimens covering 100,000 animal species supports the generalization that mitochondrial DNA clusters largely overlap with species as defined by domain experts. Most barcode clustering reflects synonymous substitutions. What evolutionary mechanisms account for synonymous clusters being largely coincident with species? The answer depends on whether variants are phenotypically neutral. To the degree that variants are selectable, purifying selection limits variation within species and neighboring species may have distinct adaptive peaks. Phenotypically neutral variants are only subject to demographic processes—drift, lineage sorting, genetic hitchhiking, and bottlenecks. The evolution of modern humans has been studied from several disciplines with detail unique among animal species. Mitochondrial barcodes provide a commensurable way to compare modern humans to other animal species. Barcode variation in the modern human population is quantitatively similar to that within other animal species. Several convergent lines of evidence show that mitochondrial diversity in modern humans follows from sequence uniformity followed by the accumulation of largely neutral diversity during a population expansion that began approximately 100,000 years ago. A straightforward hypothesis is that the extant populations of almost all animal species have arrived at a similar result consequent to a similar process of expansion from mitochondrial uniformity within the last one to several hundred thousand years.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Efficient expression of genes in the Drosophila germline using a UAS-promoter free of interference by Hsp70 piRNAs, bioRxiv, 2018-03-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTControlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years. However, most existing GAL4 expression constructs only function effectively in somatic cells, but not in germ cells during oogenesis, for unknown reasons. A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis. By reducing Hsp70 sequences targeted by piRNAs, we created UASz, which functions better than UASp in the germline and like UASt in somatic cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inference of CRISPR Edits from Sanger Trace Data, bioRxiv, 2018-01-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractEfficient precision genome editing requires a quick, quantitative, and inexpensive assay of editing outcomes. Here we present ICE (Inference of CRISPR Edits), which enables robust analysis of CRISPR edits using Sanger data. ICE proposes potential outcomes for editing with guide RNAs (gRNAs) and then determines which are supported by the data via regression. Additionally, we develop a score called ICE-D (Discordance) that can provide information on large or unexpected edits. We empirically confirm through over 1,800 edits that the ICE algorithm is robust, reproducible, and can analyze CRISPR experiments within days after transfection. We also confirm that ICE strongly correlates with next-generation sequencing of amplicons (Amp-Seq). The ICE tool is free to use and offers several improvements over current analysis tools. For instance, ICE can analyze individual experiments as well as multiple experiments simultaneously (batch analysis). ICE can also detect a wider variety of outcomes, including multi-guide edits (multiple gRNAs per target) and edits resulting from homology-directed repair (HDR), such as knock-ins and base edits. ICE is a reliable analysis tool that can significantly expedite CRISPR editing workflows.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Homology Directed Repair by Cas9Donor Co-localization in Mammalian Cells, bioRxiv, 2018-01-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHomology directed repair (HDR) induced by site specific DNA double strand breaks (DSB) with CRISPRCas9 is a precision gene editing approach that occurs at low frequency in comparison to indel forming non homologous end joining (NHEJ). In order to obtain high HDR percentages in mammalian cells, we engineered Cas9 protein fused to a high-affinity monoavidin domain to deliver biotinylated donor DNA to a DSB site. In addition, we used the cationic polymer, polyethylenimine, to deliver Cas9 RNP-donor DNA complex into the cell. Combining these strategies improved HDR percentages of up to 90% in three tested loci (CXCR4, EMX1, and TLR) in standard HEK293 cells. Our approach offers a cost effective, simple and broadly applicable gene editing method, thereby expanding the CRISPRCas9 genome editing toolbox.SummaryPrecision gene editing occurs at a low percentage in mammalian cells using Cas9. Colocalization of donor with Cas9MAV and PEI delivery raises HDR occurrence.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Stability of association between Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas pathogens over evolutionary time scales, bioRxiv, 2018-01-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryCrop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild plant pathogens, we carried out a multi-year multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in the natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a pathogenic clade present in all sites. Sequencing of 1,524 Pseudomonas genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically distinct pathogenic sublineages. These sublineages have expanded in parallel within the same populations and are differentiated both at the level of gene content and disease phenotype. Such coexistence of diverse sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake these A. thaliana populations in the recent past. Our results suggest that the selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts may be more complex than those in agricultural systems.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Classification of Single Particles from Human Cell Extract Reveals Distinct Structures, bioRxiv, 2018-01-15</h4>
          <p>SummaryMulti-protein complexes are necessary for nearly all cellular processes, and understanding their structure is required for elucidating their function. Current high-resolution strategies in structural biology are effective, but lag behind other fields (e.g. genomics and proteomics) due to their reliance on purified samples rather than characterizing heterogeneous mixtures. Here, we present a method combining single particle analysis by electron microscopy with protein identification by mass spectrometry to structurally characterize macromolecular complexes from extracts of human cells. We obtain three-dimensional structures of native proteasomes directly from ab initio classification of a heterogeneous mixture of protein complexes. In addition, we find an ~1 MDa size structure of unknown composition and reference our proteomics data to suggest possible identities. Our study shows the power of using a shotgun approach to electron microscopy (shotgun EM) when coupled with mass spectrometry as a tool to uncover the structures of macromolecular machines in parallel.</p>
