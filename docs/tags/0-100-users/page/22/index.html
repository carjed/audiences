          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability in large-scale brain systems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Many studies of large-scale neural systems have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations (functional connectivity) during task states relative to resting state. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations&#39; dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cooler scalable storage for Hi-C data and other genomically-labeled arrays, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23</h4>
          <p>Most existing coverage-based (epi)genomic datasets are one-dimensional, but newer technologies probing interactions (physical, genetic, etc.) produce quantitative maps with two-dimensional genomic coordinate systems. Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically-labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns, and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium. Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed, and can be installed from the Python Package Index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at httpsgithub.commirnylabcooler.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomic analysis reveals a functional role for myocardial trabeculae in adults, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23</h4>
          <p>Since being first described by Leonardo da Vinci in 1513 it has remained an enigma why the endocardial surfaces of the adult heart retain a complex network of muscular trabeculae - with their persistence thought to be a vestige of embryonic development. For causative physiological inference we harness population genomics, image-based intermediate phenotyping and in silico modelling to determine the effect of this complex cardiovascular trait on function. Using deep learning-based image analysis we identified genetic associations with trabecular complexity in 18,097 UK Biobank participants which were replicated in an independently measured cohort of 1,129 healthy adults. Genes in these associated regions are enriched for expression in the fetal heart or vasculature and implicate loci associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and developmental pathways. A causal relationship between increasing trabecular complexity and both ventricular performance and electrical activity are supported by complementary biomechanical simulations and Mendelian randomisation studies. These findings show that myocardial trabeculae are a previously-unrecognised determinant of cardiovascular physiology in adult humans.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolution-guided design of super-restrictor antiviral proteins reveals a breadth-versus-specificity tradeoff, bioRxiv, 2019-02-22</h4>
          <p>Host-virus evolutionary arms-races are driven by antagonistic interactions and often manifest as recurrent amino acid changes (i.e., positive selection) at their protein-protein interaction interfaces. Here, we investigated whether combinatorial mutagenesis of positions under positive selection in a host antiviral protein could enhance its restrictive properties. We tested ~800 variants of the human MxA protein, generated by combinatorial mutagenesis, for their ability to restrict Thogoto orthomyxovirus (THOV). We identified MxA ‘super-restrictors&#39; with increased binding to THOV NP target protein and 10-fold higher anti-THOV restriction relative to wild-type human MxA, the most potent naturally-occurring anti-THOV restrictor identified. However, MxA super-restrictors of THOV were impaired in their restriction of influenza A virus. Our findings thus reveal a breadth-versus-specificity tradeoff that constrains the adaptive landscape of antiviral proteins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Branch-Specific Speciation and Extinction Rates, bioRxiv, 2019-02-21</h4>
          <p>Species richness varies considerably among the tree of life which can only be explained by heterogeneous rates of diversification (speciation and extinction). Previous approaches use phylogenetic trees to estimate branch-specific diversification rates. However, all previous approaches disregard diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages although 99% of species that ever existed are now extinct. Here we describe a lineage-specific birth-death-shift process where lineages, both extant and extinct, may have heterogeneous rates of diversification. To facilitate probability computation we discretize the base distribution on speciation and extinction rates into k rate categories. The fixed number of rate categories allows us to extend the theory of state-dependent speciation and extinction models (e.g., BiSSE and MuSSE) to compute the probability of an observed phylogeny given the set of speciation and extinction rates. To estimate branch-specific diversification rates, we develop two independent and theoretically equivalent approaches numerical integration with stochastic character mapping and data-augmentation with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We validate the implementation of the two approaches in RevBayes using simulated data and an empirical example study of primates. In the empirical example, we show that estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are, unsurprisingly, very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. Instead, branch-specific diversification rate estimates are less sensitive to the assumed prior distribution on the number of diversification-rate shifts and consistently infer an increased rate of diversification for Old World Monkeys. Additionally, we observe that as few as 10 diversification-rate categories are sufficient to approximate a continuous base distribution on diversification rates. In conclusion, our implementation of the lineage-specific birth-death-shift model in RevBayes provides biologists with a method to estimate branch-specific diversification rates under a mathematically consistent model.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pancreas patch-seq links physiologic dysfunction in diabetes to single-cell transcriptomic phenotypes, bioRxiv, 2019-02-21</h4>
          <p>Pancreatic islet cells regulate glucose homeostasis through insulin and glucagon secretion; dysfunction of these cells leads to severe diseases like diabetes. Prior single-cell transcriptome studies have shown heterogeneous gene expression in major islet cell-types; however it remains challenging to reconcile this transcriptomic heterogeneity with observed islet cell functional variation. Here we achieved electrophysiological profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing in the same islet cell (pancreas patch-seq) thereby linking transcriptomic phenotypes to physiologic properties. We collected 1,369 cells from the pancreas of donors with or without diabetes and assessed function-gene expression networks. We identified a set of genes and pathways that drive functional heterogeneity in β-cells and used these to predict β-cell electrophysiology. We also report specific transcriptional programs that correlate with dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and extend this approach to cryopreserved cells from donors with type 1 diabetes (T1D), generating a valuable resource for understanding islet cell heterogeneity in health and disease.</p>
