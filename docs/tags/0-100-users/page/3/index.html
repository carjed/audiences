          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probabilistic Models of Larval Zebrafish Behavior Structure on Many Scales, bioRxiv, 2019-06-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractNervous systems have evolved to combine environmental information with internal state to select and generate adaptive behavioral sequences. To better understand these computations and their implementation in neural circuits, natural behavior must be carefully measured and quantified. Here, we collect high spatial resolution video of single zebrafish larvae swimming in a naturalistic environment and develop models of their action selection across exploration and hunting. Zebrafish larvae swim in punctuated bouts separated by longer periods of rest called interbout intervals. We take advantage of this structure by categorizing bouts into discrete types and representing their behavior as labeled sequences of bout-types emitted over time. We then construct probabilistic models – specifically, marked renewal processes – to evaluate how bout-types and interbout intervals are selected by the fish as a function of its internal hunger state, behavioral history, and the locations and properties of nearby prey. Finally, we evaluate the models by their predictive likelihood and their ability to generate realistic trajectories of virtual fish swimming through simulated environments. Our simulations capture multiple timescales of structure in larval zebrafish behavior and expose many ways in which hunger state influences their action selection to promote food seeking during hunger and safety during satiety.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Teaching R in the undergraduate ecology classroom approaches, lessons learned, and recommendations, bioRxiv, 2019-06-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractEcology requires training in data management and analysis. In this paper, we present data from the last 10 years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor’s degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. We discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field lab, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field lab, focused on analyzing existing data sets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time sink for course preparation; and, there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one’s course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students’ continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Wild pollinator activities negatively related to honey bee colony densities in urban context, bioRxiv, 2019-06-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractAs pollinator decline is increasingly reported in natural and agricultural environments, cities are perceived as shelters for pollinators because of low pesticide exposure and high floral diversity throughout the year. This has led to the development of environmental policies supporting pollinators in urban areas. However, policies are often restricted to the promotion of honey bee colony installations, which resulted in a strong increase in apiary numbers in cities. Recently, competition for floral resources between wild pollinators and honey bees has been highlighted in semi-natural contexts, but whether urban beekeeping could impact wild pollinators remains unknown. Here, we show that in the city of Paris (France), wild pollinator visitation rates is negatively correlated to honey bee colony densities present in the surrounding (500m – slope = −0.614; p = 0.001 – and 1000m – slope = −0.489; p = 0.005). More particularly, large solitary bees and beetles were significantly affected at 500m (respectively slope = −0.425, p = 0.007 and slope = - 0.671, p = 0.002) and bumblebees were significantly affected at 1000m (slope = - 0.451, p = 0.012). Further, lower interaction evenness in plant-pollinator networks was observed with honey bee colony densities within 1000 meter buffers (slope = −0.487, p = 0.008). Finally, honey bees tended to focus their foraging activity on managed rather than spontaneous plant species (student t-test, p = 0.001) whereas wild pollinators equally visited managed and spontaneous species. We advocate responsible practices mitigating the introduction of high density of hives in urban environments. Future studies are needed to deepen our knowledge about the potential negative interactions between wild and domesticated pollinators.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Optogenetic control of Wnt signaling for modeling early embryogenic patterning with human pluripotent stem cells, bioRxiv, 2019-06-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and self-organization during early embryonic development are governed by dynamic, spatially and temporally varying morphogen signals. Analogous tissue patterns emerge spontaneously in embryonic stem cell (ESC) models for gastrulation, but mechanistic insight into this self-organization is limited by a lack of molecular methods to precisely control morphogen signal dynamics. Here we combine optogenetic stimulation and single-cell imaging approaches to study self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells. Precise control of morphogen signal dynamics, achieved through activation of canonical Wntβ-catenin signaling over a broad high dynamic range (&amp;gt;500-fold) using an optoWnt optogenetic system, drove broad transcriptional changes and mesendoderm differentiation of human ESCs at high efficiency (&amp;gt;95% cells). Furthermore, activating Wnt signaling in subpopulations of ESCs in 2D and 3D cultures induced cell self-organization and morphogenesis reminiscent of human gastrulation, including changes in cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our findings thus reveal an instructive role for Wnt in directing cell patterning in this ESC model for gastrulation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Multiparametric phenotyping of compound effects on patient derived organoids, bioRxiv, 2019-06-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractPatient derived organoids (PDOs) closely resemble individual tumor biology and allow testing of small molecules ex vivo. To systematically dissect compound effects on 3D organoids, we developed a high-throughput imaging and quantitative analysis approach. We generated PDOs from colorectal cancer patients, treated them with &amp;gt;500 small molecules and captured &amp;gt;3 million images by confocal microscopy. We developed the software framework SCOPE to measure compound induced re-organization of PDOs. We found diverse, but re-occurring phenotypes that clustered by compound mode-of-action. Complex phenotypes were not congruent with PDO viability and many were specific to subsets of PDO lines or were influenced by recurrent mutations. We further analyzed specific phenotypes induced by compound classes and found GSK3 inhibitors to disassemble PDOs via focal adhesion signaling or that MEK inhibition led to bloating of PDOs by enhancing of stemness. Finally, by viability classification, we show heterogeneous susceptibilities of PDOs to clinical anticancer drugs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Minimum epistasis interpolation for sequence-function relationships, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractMassively parallel phenotyping assays have provided unprecedented insight into how multiple mutations combine to determine biological function. While these assays can measure phenotypes for thousands to millions of genotypes in a single experiment, in practice these measurements are not exhaustive, so that there is a need for techniques to impute values for genotypes whose phenotypes are not directly assayed. Here we present a method based on the idea of inferring the least epistatic possible sequence-function relationship compatible with the data. In particular, we infer the reconstruction in which mutational effects change as little as possible across adjacent genetic backgrounds. Although this method is highly conservative and has no tunable parameters, it also makes no assumptions about the form that genetic interactions take, resulting in predictions that can behave in a very complicated manner where the data require it but which are nearly additive where data is sparse or absent. We apply this method to analyze a fitness landscape for protein G, showing that our technique can provide a substantially less epistatic fit to the landscape than standard methods with little loss in predictive power. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the complex structure of epistasis observed in this dataset can be well-understood in terms of a simple qualitative model consisting of three fitness peaks where the landscape is locally additive in the vicinity of each peak.</p>
