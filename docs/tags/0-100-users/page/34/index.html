          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring and Mitigating PCR Bias in Microbiome Data, bioRxiv, 2019-04-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractPCR amplification plays a central role in the measurement of mixed microbial communities via high-throughput sequencing. Yet PCR is also known to be a common source of bias in microbiome data. Here we present a paired modeling and experimental approach to characterize and mitigate PCR bias in microbiome studies. We use experimental data from mock bacterial communities to validate our approach and human gut microbiota samples to characterize PCR bias under real-world conditions. Our results suggest that PCR can bias estimates of microbial relative abundances by a factor of 2-4 but that this bias can be mitigated using simple Bayesian multinomial logistic-normal linear models.Author summaryHigh-throughput sequencing is often used to profile host-associated microbial communities. Many processing steps are required to transform a community of bacteria into a pool of DNA suitable for sequencing. One important step is amplification where, to create enough DNA for sequencing, DNA from many different bacteria are repeatedly copied using a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, PCR is known to introduce bias as DNA from some bacteria are more efficiently copied than others. Here we introduce an experimental procedure that allows this bias to be measured and computational techniques that allow this bias to be mitigated in sequencing data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Native molecule sequencing by nano-ID reveals synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractEukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use ‘short-read’ sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID), a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling, ‘long-read’ nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pooled-parent exome sequencing to prioritise de novo variants in genetic disease, bioRxiv, 2019-04-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the clinical setting, exome sequencing has become standard-of-care in diagnosing rare genetic disorders, however many patients remain unsolved. Trio sequencing has been demonstrated to produce a higher diagnostic yield than singleton (proband-only) sequencing. Parental sequencing is especially useful when a disease is suspected to be caused by a de novo variant in the proband, because parental data provide a strong filter for the majority of variants that are shared by the proband and their parents. However the additional cost of sequencing the parents makes the trio strategy uneconomical for many clinical situations. With two thirds of the sequencing budget being spent on parents, these are funds that could be used to sequence more probands. For this reason many clinics are reluctant to sequence parents.Here we propose a pooled-parent strategy for exome sequencing of individuals with likely de novo disease. In this strategy, DNA from all the parents of a cohort of unrelated probands is pooled together into a single exome capture and sequencing run. Variants called in the proband can then be filtered if they are also found in the parent pool, resulting in a shorter list of prioritised variants. To evaluate the pooled-parent strategy we performed a series of simulations by combining reads from individual exomes to imitate sample pooling. We assessed the recall and false positive rate and investigated the trade-off between pool size and recall rate. We compared the performance of GATK HaplotypeCaller individual and joint calling, and FreeBayes to genotype pooled samples. Finally, we applied a pooled-parent strategy to a set of real unsolved cases and showed that the parent pool is a powerful filter that is complementary to other commonly used variant filters such as population variant frequencies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Geosmin attracts Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to oviposition sites, bioRxiv, 2019-04-05</h4>
          <p>Geosmin is one of the most recognizable and common microbial smells on the planet. Some insects, like mosquitoes, require microbial-rich environments for their progeny, whereas for other insects such microbes may prove dangerous. In the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, geosmin is decoded in a remarkably precise fashion and induces aversion, presumably signaling the presence of harmful microbes. We have here investigated the effect of geosmin on the behavior of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. In contrast to flies, geosmin is not aversive in mosquitoes but stimulates egg-laying site selection. Female mosquitoes could associate geosmin with microbes, including cyanobacteria consumed by larvae, who also find geosmin – as well as geosmin producing cyanobacteria – attractive. Using in vivo multiphoton imaging from mosquitoes with pan-neural expression of the calcium reporter GCaMP6s, we show that Ae. aegypti code geosmin in a similar fashion to flies, i.e. with extreme sensitivity and with a high degree of selectivity. We further demonstrate that geosmin can be used as bait under field conditions, and finally we show that geosmin, which is both expensive and difficult to obtain, can be substituted by beetroot peel extract, providing a cheap and viable mean of mosquito control and surveillance in developing countries.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inferring the function performed by a recurrent neural network, bioRxiv, 2019-04-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractA central goal in systems neuroscience is to understand the functions performed by neural circuits. Previous top-down models addressed this question by comparing the behaviour of an ideal model circuit, optimised to perform a given function, with neural recordings. However, this requires guessing in advance what function is being performed, which may not be possible for many neural systems. Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses recorded neural responses to directly infer the function performed by a neural network. We assume that the goal of the network can be expressed via a reward function, which describes how desirable each state of the network is for carrying out a given objective. This allows us to frame the problem of optimising each neuron’s responses by viewing neurons as agents in a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm; likewise the problem of inferring the reward function from the observed dynamics can be treated using inverse RL. Our framework encompasses previous influential theories of neural coding, such as efficient coding and attractor network models, as special cases, given specific choices of reward function. Finally, we can use the reward function inferred from recorded neural responses to make testable predictions about how the network dynamics will adapt depending on contextual changes, such as cell death andor varying input statistics, so as to carry out the same underlying function with different constraints.</p>
