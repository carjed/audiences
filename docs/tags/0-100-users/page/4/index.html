          <p>AbstractAuxin-Inducible Degron (AID) technology enables conditional depletion of targeted proteins. However, the applicability of the AID in vertebrate cells has been limited due to cytotoxicity caused by high auxin concentrations. Here, we establish an improved AID system using an engineered orthogonal auxin-TIR1 pair, which exhibits over 1,000 times stronger binding. With ~1,000-fold less auxin concentration, we achieved to generate the AID-based knockout cells in various human and mouse cell lines in a single transfection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Connectomics analysis reveals first, second, and third order thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons in the adult Drosophila brain, bioRxiv, 2020-01-21</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYAnimals exhibit innate and learned preferences for temperature and humidity – conditions critical for their survival and reproduction. Here, we leveraged a whole adult brain electron microscopy volume to study the circuitry associated with antennal thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons, which target specific ventroposterior (VP) glomeruli in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe. We have identified two new VP glomeruli, in addition to the five known ones, and the projection neurons (VP PNs) that relay VP information to higher brain centres, including the mushroom body and lateral horn, seats of learned and innate olfactory behaviours, respectively. Focussing on the mushroom body lateral accessory calyx (lACA), a known thermosensory neuropil, we present a comprehensive connectome by reconstructing neurons downstream of heating- and cooling-responsive VP PNs. We find that a few lACA-associated mushroom body intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) solely receive thermosensory inputs, while most receive additional olfactory and thermo- or hygrosensory PN inputs in the main calyx. Unexpectedly, we find several classes of lACA-associated neurons that form a local network with outputs to other brain neuropils, suggesting that the lACA serves as a general hub for thermosensory circuitry. For example, we find DN1 pacemaker neurons that link the lACA to the accessory medulla, likely mediating temperature-based entrainment of the circadian clock. Finally, we survey strongly connected downstream partners of VP PNs across the protocerebrum; these include a descending neuron that receives input mainly from dry-responsive VP PNs, meaning that just two synapses might separate hygrosensory inputs from motor neurons in the nerve cord.

          <p>AbstractSuper-Resolution (SR) Microscopy based on 3D Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is now well established1,2 and its wide-spread adoption has led to the development of more than 36 software packages, dedicated to quantitative evaluation of the spatial and temporal detection of fluorophore photoswitching3. While the initial emphasis in the 3D SMLM field has clearly been on improving resolution and data quality, there is now a marked absence of 3D visualization approaches that enable the straightforward, high-fidelity exploration of this type of data. Inspired by the horological phosphorescence points that illuminate watch-faces in the dark, we present vLUME (Visualization of the Universe in a Micro Environment, pronounced ‘volume’) a free-for-academic-use immersive virtual reality-based (VR) visualization software package purposefully designed to render large 3D-SMLM data sets. vLUME enables robust visualization, segmentation and quantification of millions of fluorescence puncta from any 3D SMLM technique. vLUME has an intuitive user-interface and is compatible with all commercial VR hardware (Oculus RiftQuest and HTC Vive, Supplementary Video 1). vLUME accelerates the analysis of highly complex 3D point-cloud data and the rapid identification of defects that are otherwise neglected in global quality metrics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Primordial emergence of a nucleic acid binding protein via phase separation and statistical ornithine to arginine conversion, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractDe novo emergence, and emergence of the earliest proteins specifically, demands a transition from disordered polypeptides into structured proteins with well-defined functions. However, can peptides confer evolutionary relevant functions, let alone with minimal abiotic amino acid alphabets? How can such polypeptides evolve into mature proteins? Specifically, while nucleic acids binding is presumed a primordial function, it demands basic amino acids that do not readily form abiotically. To address these questions, we describe an experimentally-validated trajectory from a phase-separating polypeptide to a dsDNA-binding protein. The intermediates comprise sequence-duplicated, functional proteins made of only 10 amino acid types, with ornithine, which can form abiotically, as the only basic amino acid. Statistical, chemical modification of ornithine sidechains to arginine promoted structure and function. The function concomitantly evolved – from phase separation with RNA (coacervates) to avid and specific dsDNA binding – thereby demonstrating a smooth, gradual peptide-to-protein transition with respect to sequence, structure, and function.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rigor and Transparency Index, a new metric of quality for assessing biological and medical science methods, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe reproducibility crisis in science is a multifaceted problem involving practices and incentives, both in the laboratory and in publication. Fortunately, some of the root causes are known and can be addressed by scientists and authors alike. After careful consideration of the available literature, the National Institutes of Health identified several key problems with the way that scientists conduct and report their research and introduced guidelines to improve the rigor and reproducibility of pre-clinical studies. Many journals have implemented policies addressing these same criteria. We currently have, however, no comprehensive data on how these guidelines are impacting the reporting of research. Using SciScore, an automated tool developed to review the methods sections of manuscripts for the presence of criteria associated with the NIH and other reporting guidelines, e.g., ARRIVE, RRIDs, we have analyzed ∼1.6 million PubMed Central papers to determine the degree to which articles were addressing these criteria. The tool scores each paper on a ten point scale identifying sentences that are associated with compliance with criteria associated with increased rigor (5 pts) and those associated with key resource identification and authentication (5 pts). From these data, we have built the Rigor and Transparency Index, which is the average score for analyzed papers in a particular journal. Our analyses show that the average score over all journals has increased since 1997, but remains below five, indicating that less than half of the rigor and reproducibility criteria are routinely addressed by authors. To analyze the data further, we examined the prevalence of individual criteria across the literature, e.g., the reporting of a subject’s sex (21-37% of studies between 1997 and 2019), the inclusion of sample size calculations (2-10%), whether the study addressed blinding (3-9%), or the identifiability of key biological resources such as antibodies (11-43%), transgenic organisms (14-22%), and cell lines (33-39%). The greatest increase in prevalence for rigor criteria was seen in the use of randomization of subjects (10-30%), while software tool identifiability improved the most among key resource types (42-87%). We further analyzed individual journals over time that had implemented specific author guidelines covering rigor criteria, and found that in some journals, they had a big impact, whereas in others they did not. We speculate that unless they are enforced, author guidelines alone do little to improve the number of criteria addressed by authors. Our Rigor and Transparency Index did not correlate with the impact factors of journals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Skd3 (human CLPB) is a potent mitochondrial protein disaggregase that is inactivated by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria-linked mutations, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTCells have evolved specialized protein disaggregases to reverse toxic protein aggregation and restore protein functionality. In nonmetazoan eukaryotes, the AAA&#43; disaggregase Hsp78 resolubilizes and reactivates proteins in mitochondria. Curiously, metazoa lack Hsp78. Hence, whether metazoan mitochondria reactivate aggregated proteins is unknown. Here, we establish that a mitochondrial AAA&#43; protein, Skd3 (human CLPB), couples ATP hydrolysis to protein disaggregation and reactivation. The Skd3 ankyrin-repeat domain combines with conserved AAA&#43; elements to enable stand-alone disaggregase activity. A mitochondrial inner-membrane protease, PARL, removes an autoinhibitory peptide from Skd3 to greatly enhance disaggregase activity. Indeed, PARL-activated Skd3 dissolves α-synuclein fibrils connected to Parkinson’s disease. Human cells lacking Skd3 exhibit reduced solubility of various mitochondrial proteins, including anti-apoptotic Hax1. Importantly, Skd3 variants linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a severe mitochondrial disorder, display diminished disaggregase activity (but not always reduced ATPase activity), which predicts disease severity. Thus, Skd3 is a potent protein disaggregase critical for human health.</p>
