          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale death of retinal astrocytes during normal development mediated by microglia, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04</h4>
          <p>Naturally-occurring cell death is a fundamental developmental mechanism for regulating cell numbers and sculpting developing organs. This is particularly true in the central nervous system, where large numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes are eliminated via apoptosis during normal development. Given the profound impact of death upon these two major cell populations, it is surprising that developmental death of another major cell type – the astrocyte – has rarely been studied. It is presently unclear whether astrocytes are subject to significant amounts of developmental death, or how it occurs. Here we address these questions using mouse retinal astrocytes as our model system. We show that the total number of retinal astrocytes declines by over 3-fold during a death period spanning postnatal days 5-14. Surprisingly, these astrocytes do not die by apoptosis, the canonical mechanism underlying the vast majority of developmental cell death. Instead, we find that microglia kill and engulf astrocytes to mediate their developmental removal. Genetic ablation of microglia inhibits astrocyte death, leading to a larger astrocyte population size at the end of the death period. However, astrocyte death is not completely blocked in the absence of microglia, apparently due to the ability of astrocytes to engulf each other. Nevertheless, mice lacking microglia showed significant anatomical changes to the retinal astrocyte network, with functional consequences for the astrocyte-associated vasculature leading to retinal hemorrhage. These results establish a novel modality for naturally-occurring cell death, and demonstrate its importance for formation and integrity of the retinal gliovascular network.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Suppression of unwanted CRISPRCas9 editing by co-administration of catalytically inactivating truncated guide RNAs, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractCRISPRCas9 nucleases are powerful genome engineering tools, but unwanted cleavage at off-target and previously edited sites remains a major concern. Numerous strategies to reduce unwanted cleavage have been devised, but all are imperfect. Here, we report off-target sites can be shielded from the active Cas9•single guide RNA (sgRNA) complex through the co-administration of dead-RNAs (dRNAs), truncated guide RNAs that direct Cas9 binding but not cleavage. dRNAs can effectively suppress a wide-range of off-targets with minimal optimization while preserving on-target editing, and they can be multiplexed to suppress several off-targets simultaneously. dRNAs can be combined with high-specificity Cas9 variants, which often do not eliminate all unwanted editing. Moreover, dRNAs can prevent cleavage of homology-directed repair (HDR)-corrected sites, facilitating “scarless” editing by eliminating the need for blocking mutations. Thus, we enable precise genome editing by establishing a novel and flexible approach for suppressing unwanted editing of both off-targets and HDR-corrected sites.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Genomics of Selfing in Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) Catching Purging in the Act, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIn plants, self-fertilization is both an important reproductive strategy and a valuable genetic tool. In theory, selfing increases homozygosity at a rate of 0.50 per generation. Increased homozygosity can uncover recessive deleterious variants and lead to inbreeding depression, unless it is countered by the loss of these variants by genetic purging. Here we investigated the dynamics of purging on genomic scale by testing three predictions. The first was that heterozygous, putatively deleterious SNPs were preferentially lost from the genome during continued selfing. The second was that the loss of deleterious SNPs varied as a function of recombination rate, because recombination increases the efficacy of selection by uncoupling linked variants. Finally, we predicted that genome size (GS) decreases during selfing, due to the purging of deleterious transposable element (TE) insertions. We tested these three predictions by following GS and SNP variants in a series of selfed maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) lines over six generations. In these lines, putatively deleterious alleles were purged, and purging was more pronounced in highly recombining regions. Homozygosity increased more slowly than expected; instead of increasing by 50% each generation, it increased by 35% to 40%. Finally, three lines showed dramatic decreases in GS, losing an average of 398 Mb from their genomes over the short timeframe of our experiment. TEs were the principal component of loss, and GS loss was more likely for lineages that began with more TE and more chromosomal knob repeats. Overall, this study documented remarkable GS loss – as much DNA as three Arabidopsis thaliana genomes, on average - in only a few generations of selfing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Allododecaploid yeasts synthetic hybrids of six species, bioRxiv, 2019-04-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractPolyploidy generates diversity by increasing the number of copies of each chromosome. Many plants, animals, fungi, and other eukaryotes are ancient or recent polyploids, including some of the best-known evolutionary radiations, crops, and industrial organisms. Polyploidy facilitates differentiation and adaptation to new environments, but the tools to test its limits are lacking. Here we develop an iterative Hybrid Production (iHyPr) method to produce allododecaploid yeast strains with a base ploidy of 12n. Chromosomal instability increased dramatically as additional copies of the genome were added. These six-species hybrids rapidly improved their fitness during adaptive laboratory evolution. This new method for making synthetic hybrids will enable basic research on polyploidy, cancer, and chromosome biology, as well as more applied research on biofuels, bioproducts, and synthetic biology.One sentence summaryWe constructed six-species synthetic hybrids and showed that they were chromosomally unstable but able to adapt rapidly.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Interactions between the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in cystic fibrosis, bioRxiv, 2019-04-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractCystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to poor hydration of mucus and impairment of the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive organ functions. Advancements in medical care have lead to markedly increased longevity of patients with CF, but new complications have emerged, such as early onset of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although the pathogenesis of CRC in CF remains unclear, altered host-microbe interactions might play a critical role. Here, we characterize the changes in the gut microbiome and host gene expression in colonic mucosa of CF patients relative to healthy controls. We find that CF patients show decreased microbial diversity, decreased abundance of taxa such as Butyricimonas, Sutterella, and Ruminococcaceae, and increased abundance of other taxa, such as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. We find that 1543 genes, including CFTR, show differential expression in the colon of CF patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, we find that these genes are enriched with functions related to gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, such as metastasis of CRC, tumor suppression, cellular dysfunction, p53 and mTOR signaling pathways. Lastly, we modeled associations between relative abundances of specific bacterial taxa in the gut mucosa and host gene expression, and identified CRC-related genes, including LCN2 and DUOX2, for which gene expression is correlated with the abundance of CRC-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae and Veillonella. Our results provide new insight into the role of host-microbe interactions in the etiology of CRC in CF.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A heterochromatin-specific RNA export pathway facilitates piRNA production, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide transposon silencing in animals. The 22-30nt piRNAs are processed in the cytoplasm from long non-coding RNAs. How piRNA precursors, which often lack RNA processing hallmarks of export-competent transcripts, achieve nuclear export is unknown. Here, we uncover the RNA export pathway specific for piRNA precursors in the Drosophila germline. This pathway requires Nxf3-Nxt1, a variant of the hetero-dimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1. Nxf3 interacts with UAP56, a nuclear RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, and CG13741Bootlegger, which recruits Nxf3-Nxt1 and UAP56 to heterochromatic piRNA source loci. Upon RNA cargo binding, Nxf3 achieves nuclear export via the exportin Crm1, and accumulates together with Bootlegger in peri-nuclear nuage, suggesting that after export, Nxf3-Bootlegger delivers precursor transcripts to the piRNA processing sites. Our findings indicate that the piRNA pathway bypasses nuclear RNA surveillance systems to achieve export of heterochromatic, unprocessed transcripts to the cytoplasm, a strategy also exploited by retroviruses.</p>
