          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-06</h4>
          <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe proper staining of the plasma membrane (PM) is critical in bioimaging as it delimits the cell. Herein, we developed MemBright a family of six cyanine-based fluorescent turn-on PM probes that emit from orange to near-infrared when reaching the PM, and enable homogeneous and selective PM staining with excellent contrast in mono and two-photon microscopy. These probes are compatible with long-term live cell imaging and immunostaining. Moreover, MemBright label neurons in a brighter manner than surrounding cells allowing identification of neurons in acute brain tissue section and neuromuscular-junctions without any use of transfection or transgenic animals. At last, MemBright were used in super-resolution imaging to unravel the dendritic spines’ neck. 3D multicolor dSTORM in combination with immunostaining revealed en-passant synapse displaying endogenous glutamate receptors clustered at the axonal-dendritic contact site. MemBright probes thus constitute a universal toolkit for cell biology and neuroscience biomembrane imaging with a variety of microscopy techniques.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clonal evolution and genome stability in a 2,500-year-old fungal individual, bioRxiv, 2018-07-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the late 1980s, a genetic individual of the fungus Armillaria gallica that extended over at least 37 hectares of forest floor and encompassed hundreds of tree root systems was discovered on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Based on observed growth rates, the individual was estimated to be at least 1500 years old with a mass of more than 105 kg. Nearly three decades on, we returned to the site of individual for new sampling. We report here that the same genetic individual of A. gallica is still alive on its original site, but we estimated that it is older and larger than originally estimated, at least 2,500 years and 4 × 105 kg, respectively. We also show that mutation has occurred within the somatic cells of the individual, reflecting its historical pattern of growth from a single point. The overall rate of mutation, however, was extremely low. The large individual of A. gallica has been remarkably resistant to genomic change as it has persisted in place.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A Chromosome-Scale Assembly of the En ormous (32 Gb) Axolotl Genome, bioRxiv, 2018-07-20</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) provides critical models for studying regeneration, evolution and development. However, its large genome (~32 gigabases) presents a formidable barrier to genetic analyses. Recent efforts have yielded genome assemblies consisting of thousands of unordered scaffolds that resolve gene structures, but do not yet permit large scale analyses of genome structure and function. We adapted an established mapping approach to leverage dense SNP typing information and for the first time assemble the axolotl genome into 14 chromosomes. Moreover, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to verify the structure of these 14 scaffolds and assign each to its corresponding physical chromosome. This new assembly covers 27.3 gigabases and encompasses 94% of annotated gene models on chromosomal scaffolds. We show the assembly’s utility by resolving genome-wide orthologies between the axolotl and other vertebrates, identifying the footprints of historical introgression events that occurred during the development of axolotl genetic stocks, and precisely mapping several phenotypes including a large deletion underlying the cardiac mutant. This chromosome-scale assembly will greatly facilitate studies of the axolotl in biological research.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Efficient expression of genes in the Drosophila germline using a UAS-promoter free of interference by Hsp70 piRNAs, bioRxiv, 2018-03-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTControlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years. However, most existing GAL4 expression constructs only function effectively in somatic cells, but not in germ cells during oogenesis, for unknown reasons. A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis. By reducing Hsp70 sequences targeted by piRNAs, we created UASz, which functions better than UASp in the germline and like UASt in somatic cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Stability of association between Arabidopsis thaliana and Pseudomonas pathogens over evolutionary time scales, bioRxiv, 2018-01-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryCrop disease outbreaks are often associated with clonal expansions of single pathogenic lineages. To determine whether similar boom-and-bust scenarios hold for wild plant pathogens, we carried out a multi-year multi-site survey of Pseudomonas in the natural host Arabidopsis thaliana. The most common Pseudomonas lineage corresponded to a pathogenic clade present in all sites. Sequencing of 1,524 Pseudomonas genomes revealed this lineage to have diversified approximately 300,000 years ago, containing dozens of genetically distinct pathogenic sublineages. These sublineages have expanded in parallel within the same populations and are differentiated both at the level of gene content and disease phenotype. Such coexistence of diverse sublineages indicates that in contrast to crop systems, no single strain has been able to overtake these A. thaliana populations in the recent past. Our results suggest that the selective pressures acting on a plant pathogen in wild hosts may be more complex than those in agricultural systems.</p>
