          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sensory cortex is optimised for prediction of future input, bioRxiv, 2017-11-25</h4>
          <p>Neurons in sensory cortex are tuned to diverse features in natural scenes. But what determines which features neurons become selective to? Here we explore the idea that neuronal selectivity is optimised to represent features in the recent past of sensory input that best predict immediate future inputs. We tested this hypothesis using simple feedforward neural networks, which were trained to predict the next few video or audio frames in clips of natural scenes. The networks developed receptive fields that closely matched those of real cortical neurons, including the oriented spatial tuning of primary visual cortex, the frequency selectivity of primary auditory cortex and, most notably, in their temporal tuning properties. Furthermore, the better a network predicted future inputs the more closely its receptive fields tended to resemble those in the brain. This suggests that sensory processing is optimised to extract those features with the most capacity to predict future input.Impact statementPrediction of future input explains diverse neural tuning properties in sensory cortex.</p>

          <p>AbstractExome capture is an effective tool for surveying the genome for loci under selection. However, traditional methods require annotated genomic resources. Here, we present a method for creating cDNA probes from expressed mRNA, which are then used to enrich and capture genomic DNA for exon regions. This approach, called “EecSeq”, eliminates the need for costly probe design and synthesis. We tested EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult oysters were heat shocked at 36° C for 1 hour along with four control oysters kept at 14° C. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared for two individuals from each treatment and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. minor “edge effects”) and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions. We show that EecSeq provides comparable, if not superior, specificity and capture efficiency compared to costly, traditional methods.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Computational haplotype recovery and long-read validation identifies novel isoforms of industrially relevant enzymes from natural microbial communities, bioRxiv, 2017-11-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractPopulation-level diversity of natural microbiomes represent a biotechnological resource for biomining, biorefining and synthetic biology but requires the recovery of the exact DNA sequence (or “haplotype”) of the genes and genomes of every individual present. Computational haplotype reconstruction is extremely difficult, complicated by environmental sequencing data (metagenomics). Current approaches cannot choose between alternative haplotype reconstructions and fail to provide biological evidence of correct predictions. To overcome this, we present Hansel and Gretel a novel probabilistic framework that reconstructs the most likely haplotypes from complex microbiomes, is robust to sequencing error and uses all available evidence from aligned reads, without altering or discarding observed variation. We provide the first formalisation of this problem and propose “metahaplome” as a definition for the set of haplotypes for any genomic region of interest within a metagenomic dataset. Finally, we demonstrate using long-read sequencing, biological evidence of novel haplotypes of industrially important enzymes computationally predicted from a natural microbiome.</p>

          <p>SummaryTools to understand how the spliceosome functions in vivo have lagged behind advances in its structural biology. We describe methods to globally profile spliceosome-bound precursor, intermediates and products at nucleotide resolution. We apply these tools to three divergent yeast species that span 600 million years of evolution. The sensitivity of the approach enables detection of novel cases of non-canonical catalysis including interrupted, recursive and nested splicing. Employing statistical modeling to understand the quantitative relationships between RNA features and the data, we uncover independent roles for intron size, position and number in substrate progression through the two catalytic stages. These include species-specific inputs suggestive of spliceosome-transcriptome coevolution. Further investigations reveal ATP-dependent discard of numerous endogenous substrates at both the precursor and lariat-intermediate stages and connect discard to intron retention, a form of splicing regulation. Spliceosome profiling is a quantitative, generalizable global technology to investigate an RNP central to eukaryotic gene expression.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Measurement of spliceosome-bound precursor and intermediate in three species&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Non-canonical splicing events revealed&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Statistical modeling uncovers substrate features that predict catalytic efficiency&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Discard of suboptimal substrates occurs in vivo and predicts intron-retained mRNAs&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Dynamics of the upper airway microbiome in the pathogenesis of asthma-associated persistent wheeze in preschool children, bioRxiv, 2017-11-21</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTRepeated cycles of infection-associated lower airway inflammation drives the pathogenesis of persistent wheezing disease in children. Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that &amp;gt;80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with “transient wheeze” that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype. This suggests underlying pathogenic interactions between allergic sensitization and antibacterial mechanisms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Eye movement-related confounds in neural decoding of visual working memory representations, bioRxiv, 2017-11-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe study of visual working memory (VWM) has recently seen revitalization with the emergence of new insights and theories regarding its neural underpinnings. One crucial ingredient responsible for this progress is the rise of neural decoding techniques. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. Here, we aimed to contribute to the field by subjecting human volunteers to a combined VWMimagery task, while recording and decoding their neural signals as measured by MEG. At first sight, the results seem to provide evidence for a persistent, stable representation of the memorandum throughout the delay period. However, control analyses revealed that these findings can be explained by subtle, VWM-specific eye movements. As a potential remedy, we demonstrate the use of a functional localizer, which was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements, to train the neural decoders. This analysis revealed a sustained representation for approximately 1 second, but no longer throughout the entire delay period. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.Significance statementVisual working memory is an important aspect of higher cognition and has been subject of much investigation within the field of cognitive neuroscience. Over recent years, these studies have increasingly relied on the use of neural decoding techniques. Here, we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by stimulus-specific eye movements. Such eye movements during working memory have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon. Given the widespread use of neural decoding and the potentially contaminating effects of eye movements, we therefore believe that our results are of significant relevance for the field.</p>
