          <p>High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Alcohol consumption and mate choice in UK Biobank comparing observational and Mendelian randomization estimates, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlcohol use is correlated within spouse-pairs, but it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol consumption on mate-selection from social factors or cohabitation leading to spouses becoming more similar over time. We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection.Therefore, in a sample of over 47,000 spouse-pairs in the UK Biobank we utilised a well-characterised alcohol related variant, rs1229984 in ADH1B, as a genetic proxy for alcohol use. We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individual’s self-reported alcohol use and their partner’s rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.We found strong evidence that both an individual’s self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partner’s self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individual’s weekly alcohol consumption increased their partner’s alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10×10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation. Although the SNP is strongly associated with ancestry, our results suggest that this concordance is unlikely to be explained by population stratification. Overall, our findings suggest that alcohol behaviour directly influences mate selection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The genetic architecture of the human cerebral cortex, bioRxiv, 2018-09-03</h4>
          <p>The cerebral cortex underlies our complex cognitive capabilities, yet we know little about the specific genetic loci influencing human cortical structure. To identify genetic variants, including structural variants, impacting cortical structure, we conducted a genome-wide association meta-analysis of brain MRI data from 51,662 individuals. We analysed the surface area and average thickness of the whole cortex and 34 regions with known functional specialisations. We identified 255 nominally significant loci (P ≤ 5 × 10−8); 199 survived multiple testing correction (P ≤ 8.3 × 10−10; 187 surface area; 12 thickness). We found significant enrichment for loci influencing total surface area within regulatory elements active during prenatal cortical development, supporting the radial unit hypothesis. Loci impacting regional surface area cluster near genes in Wnt signalling pathways, known to influence progenitor expansion and areal identity. Variation in cortical structure is genetically correlated with cognitive function, Parkinson’s disease, insomnia, depression and ADHD.One Sentence SummaryCommon genetic variation is associated with inter-individual variation in the structure of the human cortex, both globally and within specific regions, and is shared with genetic risk factors for some neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Re-Evaluating One-step Generation of Mice Carrying Conditional Alleles by CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing Technology, bioRxiv, 2018-08-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractCRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has considerably facilitated the generation of mouse knockout alleles, relieving many of the cumbersome and time-consuming steps of traditional mouse embryonic stem cell technology. However, the generation of conditional knockout alleles remains an important challenge. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout alleles in mice using 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) (2sgRNA-2ssODN). We re-evaluated this method from a large data set generated from a consortium consisting of 17 transgenic core facilities or laboratories or programs across the world. The dataset constituted 17,887 microinjected or electroporated zygotes and 1,718 live born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice harbored 2 correct LoxP insertions in cis configuration indicating a very low efficiency of the method. To determine the factors required to successfully generate conditional alleles using the 2sgRNA-2ssODN approach, we performed a generalized linear regression model. We show that factors such as the concentration of the sgRNA, Cas9 protein or the distance between the placement of LoxP insertions were not predictive for the success of this technique. The major predictor affecting the method’s success was the probability of simultaneously inserting intact proximal and distal LoxP sequences, without the loss of the DNA segment between the two sgRNA cleavage sites. Our analysis of a large data set indicates that the 2sgRNA–2ssODN method generates a large number of undesired alleles (&amp;gt;99%), and a very small number of desired alleles (&amp;lt;1%) requiring, on average 1,192 zygotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">SABER enables highly multiplexed and amplified detection of DNA and RNA in cells and tissues, bioRxiv, 2018-08-28</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) reveals the abun-dance and positioning of nucleic acid sequences in fixed sam-ples and can be combined with cell segmentation to produce a powerful single cell gene expression assay. However, it re-mains difficult to label more than a few targets and to visu-alize nucleic acids in environments such as thick tissue sam-ples using conventional FISH technologies. Recently, meth-ods have been developed for multiplexed amplification of FISH signals, yet it remains challenging to achieve high lev-els of simultaneous multiplexing combined with high sam-pling efficiency and simple workflows. Here, we introduce signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER), which endows oligo-based FISH probes with long, single-stranded DNA concatemers that serve as targets for sensitive fluores-cent detection. We establish that SABER effectively ampli-fies the signal of probes targeting nucleic acids in fixed cells and tissues, can be deployed against at least 17 targets si-multaneously, and detects mRNAs with high efficiency. As a demonstration of the utility of SABER in assays involv-ing genetic manipulations, we apply multiplexed FISH of reporters and cell type markers to the identification of en-hancers with cell type-specific activity in the mouse retina. SABER represents a simple and versatile molecular toolkit to allow rapid and cost effective multiplexed imaging.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of three diverse Asian populations in Singapore, bioRxiv, 2018-08-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractAsian populations are currently underrepresented in human genetics research. Here we present whole-genome sequencing data of 4,810 Singaporeans from three diverse ethnic groups 2,780 Chinese, 903 Malays, and 1,127 Indians. Despite a medium depth of 13.7×, we achieved essentially perfect (&amp;gt;99.8%) sensitivity and accuracy for detecting common variants and good sensitivity (&amp;gt;89%) for detecting extremely rare variants with &amp;lt;0.1% allele frequency. We found 89.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 9.1 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs), more than half of which have not been cataloged in dbSNP. In particular, we found 126 common deleterious mutations (MAF&amp;gt;0.01) that were absent in the existing public databases, highlighting the importance of local population reference for genetic diagnosis. We describe fine-scale genetic structure of Singapore populations and their relationship to worldwide populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition to revealing noticeable amounts of admixture among three Singapore populations and a Malay-related novel ancestry component that has not been captured by the 1000 Genomes Project, our analysis also identified some fine-scale features of genetic structure consistent with two waves of prehistoric migration from south China to Southeast Asia. Finally, we demonstrate that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation not only for Singapore populations, but also for populations across Asia and Oceania. These results highlight the genetic diversity in Singapore and the potential impacts of our data as a resource to empower human genetics discovery in a broad geographic region.</p>
