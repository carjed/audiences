          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Re-evaluation of SNP heritability in complex human traits, bioRxiv, 2016-09-10</h4>
          <p>SNP heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by SNPs, has been reported for many hundreds of traits. Its estimation requires strong prior assumptions about the distribution of heritability across the genome, but the assumptions in current use have not been thoroughly tested. By analyzing imputed data for a large number of human traits, we empirically derive a model that more accurately describes how heritability varies with minor allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium and genotype certainty. Across 19 traits, our improved model leads to estimates of common SNP heritability on average 43% (SD 3) higher than those obtained from the widely-used software GCTA, and 25% (SD 2) higher than those from the recently-proposed extension GCTA-LDMS. Previously, DNaseI hypersensitivity sites were reported to explain 79% of SNP heritability; using our improved heritability model their estimated contribution is only 24%.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phenome-wide Heritability Analysis of the UK Biobank, bioRxiv, 2016-08-19</h4>
          <p>Heritability estimation provides important information about the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to phenotypic variation, and provides an upper bound for the utility of genetic risk prediction models. Recent technological and statistical advances have enabled the estimation of additive heritability attributable to common genetic variants (SNP heritability) across a broad phenotypic spectrum. However, assessing the comparative heritability of multiple traits estimated in different cohorts may be misleading due to the population-specific nature of heritability. Here we report the SNP heritability for 551 complex traits derived from the large-scale, population-based UK Biobank, comprising both quantitative phenotypes and disease codes, and examine the moderating effect of three major demographic variables (age, sex and socioeconomic status) on the heritability estimates. Our study represents the first comprehensive phenome-wide heritability analysis in the UK Biobank, and underscores the importance of considering population characteristics in comparing and interpreting heritability.</p>

          <p>AbstractGenetic clustering algorithms, implemented in popular programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE, have been used extensively in the characterisation of individuals and populations based on genetic data. A successful example is the reconstruction of the genetic history of African Americans who are a product of recent admixture between highly differentiated populations. Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (badMIXTURE, available at github.comdanjlawsonbadMIXTURE) to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry “palettes” estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypotheses allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history based on genetic data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The druggable genome and support for target identification and validation in drug development, bioRxiv, 2016-07-27</h4>
          <p>Target identification (identifying the correct drug targets for each disease) and target validation (demonstrating the effect of target perturbation on disease biomarkers and disease end-points) are essential steps in drug development. We showed previously that biomarker and disease endpoint associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a gene encoding a drug target accurately depict the effect of modifying the same target with a pharmacological agent; others have shown that genomic support for a target is associated with a higher rate of drug development success. To delineate drug development (including repurposing) opportunities arising from this paradigm, we connected complex disease- and biomarker-associated loci from genome wide association studies (GWAS) to an updated set of genes encoding druggable human proteins, to compounds with bioactivity against these targets and, where these were licensed drugs, to clinical indications. We used this set of genes to inform the design of a new genotyping array, to enable druggable genome-wide association studies for drug target selection and validation in human disease.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The genetic structure of the world’s first farmers, bioRxiv, 2016-06-17</h4>
          <p>We report genome-wide ancient DNA from 44 ancient Near Easterners ranging in time between ~12,000-1,400 BCE, from Natufian hunter-gatherers to Bronze Age farmers. We show that the earliest populations of the Near East derived around half their ancestry from a ‘Basal Eurasian’ lineage that had little if any Neanderthal admixture and that separated from other non-African lineages prior to their separation from each other. The first farmers of the southern Levant (Israel and Jordan) and Zagros Mountains (Iran) were strongly genetically differentiated, and each descended from local hunter-gatherers. By the time of the Bronze Age, these two populations and Anatolian-related farmers had mixed with each other and with the hunter-gatherers of Europe to drastically reduce genetic differentiation. The impact of the Near Eastern farmers extended beyond the Near East farmers related to those of Anatolia spread westward into Europe; farmers related to those of the Levant spread southward into East Africa; farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Detection of human adaptation during the past 2,000 years, bioRxiv, 2016-05-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractDetection of recent natural selection is a challenging problem in population genetics, as standard methods generally integrate over long timescales. Here we introduce the Singleton Density Score (SDS), a powerful measure to infer very recent changes in allele frequencies from contemporary genome sequences. When applied to data from the UK10K Project, SDS reflects allele frequency changes in the ancestors of modern Britons during the past 2,000 years. We see strong signals of selection at lactase and HLA, and in favor of blond hair and blue eyes. Turning to signals of polygenic adaptation we find, remarkably, that recent selection for increased height has driven allele frequency shifts across most of the genome. Moreover, we report suggestive new evidence for polygenic shifts affecting many other complex traits. Our results suggest that polygenic adaptation has played a pervasive role in shaping genotypic and phenotypic variation in modern humans.</p>
