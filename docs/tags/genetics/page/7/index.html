          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Research grade marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse is genetically divergent from commercially available Cannabis, bioRxiv, 2019-03-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractPublic comfort with Cannabis (marijuana and hemp) has recently increased, resulting in previously strict Cannabis regulations now allowing hemp cultivation, medical use, and in some states, recreational consumption. There is a growing interest in the potential medical benefits of the various chemical constituents produced by the Cannabis plant. Currently, the University of Mississippi, funded through the National Institutes of HealthNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIHNIDA), is the sole Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) licensed facility to cultivate Cannabis for research purposes. Hence, most federally funded research where participants consume Cannabis for medicinal purposes relies on NIDA-supplied product. Previous research found that cannabinoid levels in research grade marijuana supplied by NIDA did not align with commercially available Cannabis from Colorado, Washington and California. Given NIDA chemotypes were misaligned with commercial Cannabis, we sought to investigate where NIDA’s research grade marijuana falls on the genetic spectrum of Cannabis groups. NIDA research grade marijuana was found to genetically group with Hemp samples along with a small subset of commercial drug-type Cannabis. A majority of commercially available drug-type Cannabis was genetically very distinct from NIDA samples. These results suggest that subjects consuming NIDA research grade marijuana may experience different effects than average consumers.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic structure in the paternal lineages of South East Spain revealed by the analysis of 17 Y-STRs, Scientific Reports, 2019-03-26</h4>
          <p>The genetic data of 17 Y chromosome short tandem repeats in 146 unrelated donor residents in the provinces of Granada, Málaga, and Almería (GMA) were analyzed to determine the genetic legacy of the male inhabitants of the former Kingdom of Granada. A total of 139 unique haplotypes were identified. Observed allele frequencies and haplogroup frequencies were also analyzed. By AMOVA and STRUCTURE analysis, the populations of the 3 provinces could be treated genetically as a single population. The most frequent haplogroup was R1b1b2 (58.22%). By network analysis of all individuals, we observed a distribution according to haplogroup assignment. To improve the characterization of GMA population, it was compared with those of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and southern Europe. In our analysis of allele frequencies and genetic distances, the GMA population lay within the Spanish population group. Further, in the STRUCTURE analysis, there was no African component in the GMA population, confirming that, based on our genetic markers, the GMA population does not reflect any male genetic influence of the North African people. The presence of African haplogroups in the GMA population is irrelevant when their frequency is compared with those in other European populations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Recovery of trait heritability from whole genome sequence data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractHeritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors, can be estimated from pedigree data 1, but such estimates are uninformative with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on unrelated individuals have shown that for human traits and disease, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs 2–5. It is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular if the causal variants are rare, or other reasons such as over-estimation of heritability from pedigree data. Here we show that pedigree heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) appears to be fully recovered from whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on 21,620 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We assigned 47.1 million genetic variants to groups based upon their minor allele frequencies (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants nearby, and estimated and partitioned variation accordingly. The estimated heritability was 0.79 (SE 0.09) for height and 0.40 (SE 0.09) for BMI, consistent with pedigree estimates. Low-MAF variants in low LD with neighbouring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein altering variants, consistent with negative selection thereon. Cumulatively variants in the MAF range of 0.0001 to 0.1 explained 0.54 (SE 0.05) and 0.51 (SE 0.11) of heritability for height and BMI, respectively. Our results imply that the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease is accounted for by rare variants, in particular those in regions of low LD.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence in the case of asserted mtDNA biparental inheritance, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractA breakthrough article published in PNAS by Luo et al. (2018) challenges a central dogma in biology which states that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited exclusively from the mother. By sequencing the mitogenomes of several members of three independent families, the authors inferred an unprecedented pattern of biparental inheritance that requires the participation of an autosomal nuclear factor in the molecular process. However, a comprehensive analysis of their data reveals a number of issues that must be carefully addressed before challenging the current paradigm. Unfortunately, the methods section lacks any description of sample management, validation of their results in independent laboratories was deficient, and the reported findings have been observed at a frequency at complete variance with established evidence. Moreover, the remarkably high (and unusually homogeneous) levels of heteroplasmy reported can be readily detected using classical techniques for DNA sequencing. By reassessing the raw sequencing data with an alternative computational pipeline, we report strong correlation to the NextGENe results provided by the authors on a per sample base. However, the sequencing replicates from the same donors show aberrations in the variants detected that need further investigation to exclude contributions from other sources or methodological artifacts. Finally, applying the principle of reductio ad absurdum, we demonstrate that the nuclear factor invoked by the authors would need to be extraordinarily complex and precise in order to preclude linear accumulation of mtDNA lineages across generations. We discuss alternate scenarios that explain findings of the same nature as reported by Luo et al., in the context of in-vitro fertilization and therapeutic mtDNA replacement ooplasmic transplantation.</p>

          <p>SummaryAn important goal in disease genetics and evolutionary biology is to understand how mutations combine to alter phenotypes and fitness. Non-additive interactions between mutations occur extensively and change across conditions, cell types, and species, making genetic prediction a difficult challenge. To understand the reasons for this, we reduced the problem to a minimal system where we combined mutations in a single protein performing a single function (a transcriptional repressor inhibiting a target gene). Even in this minimal system, a change in gene expression altered both the strength and type of genetic interactions. These seemingly complicated changes could, however, be predicted by a mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype. We show that similar changes will be observed for many genes. These results provide fundamental insights into genotype-phenotype maps and illustrate how changes in genetic interactions can be predicted using hierarchical mechanistic models.One sentence SummaryDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor reveals that changes in gene expression will alter the strength and direction of genetic interactions between mutations in many genes.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Deep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor at two expression levels reveals extensive changes in mutational effects and genetic interactions&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Genetic interactions can switch from positive (suppressive) to negative (enhancing) as the expression of a gene changes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;A mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype accurately predicts changes in mutational effects and interactions&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Changes in expression will alter mutational effects and interactions for many genes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;For some genes, perfect mechanistic models will never be able to predict how mutations of known effect combine without measurements of intermediate phenotypes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population histories of the United States revealed through fine-scale migration and haplotype analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-03-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe population of the United States is shaped by centuries of migration, isolation, growth, and admixture between ancestors of global origins. Here, we assemble a comprehensive view of recent population history by studying the ancestry and population structure of over 32,000 individuals in the US using genetic, ancestral birth origin, and geographic data from the National Geographic Genographic Project. We identify migration routes and barriers that reflect historical demographic events. We also uncover the spatial patterns of relatedness in subpopulations through the combination of haplotype clustering, ancestral birth origin analysis, and local ancestry inference. These patterns include substantial substructure and heterogeneity in HispanicsLatinos, isolation-by-distance in African Americans, elevated levels of relatedness and homozygosity in Asian immigrants, and fine-scale structure in European descents. Taken together, our results provide detailed insights into the genetic structure and demographic history of the diverse US population.</p>
