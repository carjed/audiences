          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Excess significance bias in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation literature for neuropsychiatric disorders, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIntroductionRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely tested and promoted for use in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, but as for many other medical devices, some gaps may exist in the literature and the evidence base for rTMS clinical efficacy remains under debate. We aimed to empirically test for an excess number of statistically significant results in the literature on rTMS therapeutic efficacy across a wide range of meta-analyses and to characterize the power of studies included in these meta-analyses.MethodsBased on power calculations, we computed the expected number of “positive” datasets for a medium effect-size (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.30) and compared it with the number of observed “positive” datasets. Sensitivity analyses considered small (SMD=0.20), modest (SMD=0.50), and large (SMD=0.80) effect sizes.Results14 meta-analyses with 228 datasets (110 for neurological disorders and 118 for psychiatric disorders) were assessed. For SMD=0.3, the number of observed “positive” studies (n=94) was larger than expected (n=35). We found evidence for an excess of significant findings overall (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and in 814 meta-analyses. Evidence for an excess of significant findings was also observed for SMD=0.5 for neurological disorders. 0 (0 %), 0 (0 %), 3 (1 %), and 53 (23 %) of the 228 datasets had power &amp;gt;0.80, respectively for SMDs of 0.30, 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80.ConclusionMost studies in the rTMS literature are underpowered. This results in fragmentation and waste of research efforts. The somewhat high frequency of “positive” results seems spurious and may reflect bias.Trial Registration PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017056694</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Breaking barriers The effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition in academics, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>Lay summaryIn the past decade the scientific community has been trying to tackle the historical underrepresentation of women in science and the fact that gender can constitute a barrier to career success. However, other characteristics, such as being of an ethnic minority or coming from an under-privileged background, have received less attention. In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier. Our data suggest we need to widen the discussion regarding diversity and equality in science to incorporate potential barriers to career success in addition to gender.AbstractThe academic disciplines of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have long suffered from a lack of diversity. While in recent years there has been some progress in addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM subjects, other protected characteristics have received less attention. In this study, we survey early career scientists in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, behaviour, and related disciplines. We (i) quantitatively examine the effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition, and (ii) provide practical suggestions, based on the qualitative responses of those surveyed, for overcoming some of the barriers we identified. We found that socioeconomic background and ethnicity impacted negatively on the quantitative measures of career progression we examined. Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression. This may reflect the fact that these characteristics have received less attention, and are therefore deemed more sensitive. We hope that this study will stimulate wider discussion, and help to inform strategies to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM subjects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">PlotsOfDifferences – a web app for the quantitative comparison of unpaired data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe quantitative comparison of data acquired under different conditions is an important aspect of experimental science. The most widely used statistic for quantitative comparisons is the p-value. However, p-values suffer from several shortcomings. The most prominent shortcoming that is relevant for quantitative comparisons is that p-values fail to convey the magnitude of differences. The differences between conditions are best quantified by the determination of effect size. To democratize the calculation of effect size, we have developed a web-based tool. The tool uses bootstrapping to resample mean or median values for each of the conditions and these values are used to calculate the effect size and their compatibility interval. The web tool generates a graphical output, showing the bootstrap distribution of the difference next to the actual data for optimal interpretation. A tabular output with statistics and effect sizes is also generated and the table can be supplemented with p-values that are calculated with a randomization test. The app that we report here is dubbed PlotsOfDifferences and is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpshuygens.science.uva.nlPlotsOfDifferences&gt;httpshuygens.science.uva.nlPlotsOfDifferences&lt;jatsext-link&gt;&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float fig-type=figure orientation=portrait&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=578575_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The life of P.I. Transitions to Independence in Academia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>The data in this report summarises the responses gathered from 365 principal investigators of academic laboratories, who started their independent positions in the UK within the last 6 years up to 2018. We find that too many new investigators express frustration and poor optimism for the future. These data also reveal, that many of these individuals lack the support required to make a successful transition to independence and that simple measures could be put in place by both funders and universities in order to better support these early career researchers. We use these data to make both recommendations of good practice and for changes to policies that would make significant improvements to those currently finding independence challenging. We find that some new investigators face significant obstacles when building momentum and hiring a research team. In particular, access to PhD students. We also find some important areas such as starting salaries where significant gender differences persist, which cannot be explained by seniority. Our data also underlines the importance of support networks, within and outside the department, and the positive influence of good mentorship through this difficult career stage.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Where do our graduates go? A toolkit for retrospective and ongoing career outcomes data collection for biomedical PhD students and postdoctoral scholars, bioRxiv, 2019-02-09</h4>
          <p>Universities are at long last undertaking efforts to collect and disseminate information about student career outcomes, after decades of calls to action. Organizations such as Rescuing Biomedical Research and Future of Research brought this issue to the forefront of graduate education, and the second Future of Biomedical Graduate and Postdoctoral Training conference (FOBGAPT2) featured the collection of career outcomes data in its final recommendations, published in this journal (Hitchcock et al., 2017). More recently, 26 institutions assembled as the Coalition for Next Generation Life Science, committing to ongoing collection and dissemination of career data for both graduate and postdoc alumni. A few individual institutions have shared snapshots of the data in peer-reviewed publications (Mathur et al., 2018; Silva, des Jarlais, Lindstaedt, Rotman, Watkins, 2016) and on websites. As more and more institutions take up this call to action, they will now be looking for tools, protocols, and best practices for ongoing career outcomes data collection, management, and dissemination. Here, we describe UCSF&#39;s experiences in conducting a retrospective study, and in institutionalizing a methodology for annual data collection and dissemination. We describe and share all tools we have developed, and we provide calculations of the time and resources required to accomplish both retrospective studies and annual updates. We also include broader recommendations for implementation at your own institutions, increasing the feasibility of this endeavor.</p>

          <p>1.Executive SummaryThis survey and data analysis were conducted by the European Network of Postdoctoral Associations (ENPA) with the aim of assessing the current research and work conditions, aspirations and support received by postdoctoral researchers working in Europe.The Results section is structured into three main parts. The first one describes the study sample of European postdoctoral researchers, including participants’ demographics, funding sources and income, research outputs, and teaching opportunities. The second section focuses on their professional aspirations and institutional support provided. The third part describes the level of engagement of postdoctoral researchers and their institutions in working towards better research conditions and career development, and what initiatives are emerging within this community.Our Conclusions section pulls together this comprehensive analysis, highlighting some of the most concerning issues currently affecting postdoctoral researchers in Europe. We also make a number of recommendations that would significantly improve the career expectations and aspirations of postdoctoral researchers. These are listed below.Conclusions and recommendations&lt;jatslist list-type=order&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Longer postdoctoral periods in Southern Europe despite higher publication metricsRecommendation Institutions in Southern Europe should develop clear criteria to support postdoctoral researchers’ career progression.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Southern and Eastern Europe pay the lowest salaries and have the lowest number of foreign postdoctoral researchersRecommendation The salary differences across European countries should be addressed as this could be a barrier to mobility and knowledge exchange from higher to lower pay regions.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Lack of access to funding is a significant concern of postdoctoral researchersRecommendation Discrepancies in access to funding should be minimized across the different European areas.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Postdoctoral researchers in Europe work longer hours than required by contractRecommendation The culture of overwork in the research environment should be addressed in order to protect researchers against the risks associated with long hours at work.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;The majority of full-time postdoctoral work contracts includes an exclusivity clauseRecommendation Inclusion of exclusivity clauses in contracts for postdoctoral researchers should be optional in order to allow them to enhance their employability outside academia.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Postdoctoral researchers’ career development is poorly supported by their institutionsRecommendation Postdoctoral researchers’ career prospects and career management should be much more supported by institutions in coordination with postdoctoral associations.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Lack of postdoctoral representation in governance is linked to unclear institutional duties and rightsRecommendation Institutional governance bodies should include postdoctoral researcher representatives. This would ensure that the views of this vital staff group are heard, as well as making postdoctoral researchers feel more engaged with their own institutions. A flexible and proactive communication strategy at the institution and research group level should be developed, taking into account the sometimes transient nature of postdoctoral researchers’ posts.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Researchers show higher engagement with their local postdoctoral associations than with workers’ unionsRecommendation Postdoctoral associations are an essential way to advocate for postdoctoral researchers at the governance level. Institutions should engage with, promote and support the work of postdoctoral associations.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>
