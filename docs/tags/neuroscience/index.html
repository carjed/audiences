          <p>AbstractMiniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) have been instrumental to monitor neural activity during unrestrained behavior and their open-source versions have helped to distribute them at an affordable cost. Generally, the footprint and weight of open-source miniscopes is sacrificed for added functionality. Here, we present NINscope a light-weight, small footprint, open-source miniscope that incorporates a high-sensitivity image sensor, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and an LED driver for an external optogenetic probe. We highlight the advantages of NINscope by performing the first simultaneous cellular resolution (dual scope) recordings from cerebellum and cerebral cortex in unrestrained mice, revealing that the activity of both regions generally precedes the onset of behavioral acceleration. We further demonstrate the optogenetic stimulation capabilities of NINscope and show that cerebral cortical activity can be driven strongly by cerebellar stimulation. To validate the performance of our miniscope to image from deep-brain regions, we recorded in the dorsal striatum and, using the IMU to assess turning movements, replicate previous studies that show encoding of action space in this subcortical region. Finally, we combine optogenetic stimulation of distinct cortical regions projecting to the dorsal striatum, to probe functional connectivity. In combination with cross-platform control software, NINscope is a versatile addition to the expanding toolbox of open-source miniscopes and will aid multi-region circuit investigations during unrestrained behavior.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An individual interneuron participates in many kinds of inhibition and spans much of the mouse visual thalamus, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYIn principle, one way to define the functional role of a neuron would be to identify all the synaptic input it receives and all synaptic output it confers onto its targets. With serial electron microscopy we annotated all the input synapses (862) and output synapses (626) associated with one inhibitory interneuron in the visual thalamus of the mouse. This neuron’s neurites covered a broad swath of lateral geniculate nucleus and spanned multiple functionally distinct regions. Every one of its neurites formed synapses onto hundreds of thalamocortical cells of several different types. All but one small neurite also had dendrite-like properties and received input from retinal ganglion cell axons. Pre- and postsynaptic associations with other inhibitory interneurons were also distributed throughout the interneuron’s territory. We observed a diverse array of local synaptic motifs and three fundamentally different types of inhibitory neurites. Many thalamocortical cells were innervated weakly by this interneuron by single en passant shaft synapses. But a subset of the interneuron’s thalamocortical cell targets received multiple synaptic inputs from targeted inhibitory neurites that climbed along the thalamocortical cell’s dendrite with an assemblage of fasciculated retinal ganglion cell axons. Because of the diverse range of synaptic relationships exhibited by this one neuron, this cell defies a single functional label and seems rather to be using extremely local synaptic processing to participate in many different functions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Astrocytes Contribute to Remote Memory Formation by Modulating Hippocampal-Cortical Communication During Learning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe consolidation and retrieval of remote memories depend on the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and frontal cortices. However, the exact time at which these regions are recruited to support memory and the interactions between them are still debated. Astrocytes can sense and modify neuronal activity with great precision, but their role in cognitive function has not been extensively explored. To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying remote memory involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating neuronal activity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Poor test-retest reliability of task-fMRI New empirical evidence and a meta-analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractIdentifying brain biomarkers of disease risk and treatment response is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is fundamentally limited by measurement reliability; measures that do not yield reliable values are unsuitable as biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments with 1,088 participants reporting 1,146 ICCs for task-fMRI revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC = .397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 commonly used fMRI tasks collected in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Longitudinal Study were poor (ICCs = .067 - .485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that commonly used task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience (i.e., brain-behavior mapping). We review how this state of affairs came to be and consider several avenues for improving the reliability of task-fMRI.Significance StatementA biomarker with the potential to be useful in predicting clinical outcomes must yield values that are repeatable. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the test-retest reliability of task-fMRI measures, which are widely adopted for biomarker discovery in neuroscience. We found that the meta-analytic reliability of task-fMRI was poor. We also investigated the reliability of many of the most commonly used task-fMRI measures in two datasets recently collected with cutting-edge scanners and methods. We found generally poor reliability for these task-fMRI measures. These findings indicate that many task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience.</p>

          <p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory entails brain-wide switching between activity states. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Schizophrenia patients show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High precision coding in mouse visual cortex, bioRxiv, 2019-06-22</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTSingle neurons in visual cortex provide unreliable measurements of visual features due to their high trial-to-trial variability. It is not known if this “noise” extends its effects over large neural populations to impair the global encoding of sensory stimuli. We recorded simultaneously from ∼20,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex and found that the neural population had discrimination thresholds of 0.3° in an orientation decoding task. These thresholds are ∼100 times smaller than those reported behaviorally in mice. The discrepancy between neural and behavioral discrimination could not be explained by the types of stimuli we used, by behavioral states or by the sequential nature of trial-by-trial perceptual learning tasks. These results imply that the limits of sensory perception in mice are not set by neural noise in sensory cortex, but by the limitations of downstream decoders.</p>
