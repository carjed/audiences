          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reconciling persistent and dynamic hypotheses of working memory coding in prefrontal cortex, bioRxiv, 2017-12-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractCompeting accounts propose that working memory (WM) is subserved either by persistent activity in single neurons or by dynamic (time-varying) activity across a neural population. Here we compare these hypotheses across four regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a spatial WM task, where an intervening distractor indicated the reward available for a correct saccade. WM representations were strongest in ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) neurons with higher intrinsic temporal stability (time-constant). At the population-level, although a stable mnemonic state was reached during the delay, this tuning geometry was reversed relative to cue-period selectivity, and was disrupted by the distractor. Single-neuron analysis revealed many neurons switched to coding reward, rather than maintaining task-relevant spatial selectivity until saccade. These results imply WM is fulfilled by dynamic, population-level activity within high time-constant neurons. Rather than persistent activity supporting stable mnemonic representations that bridge distraction, PFC neurons may stabilise a dynamic population-level process that supports WM.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A Quantitative Assessment of Prefrontal Cortex in Humans Relative to Nonhuman Primates, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractHumans have the largest cerebral cortex among primates. A long-standing controversy is whether association cortex, particularly prefrontal cortex (PFC), is disproportionately larger in humans compared to nonhuman primates, as some studies report that human PFC is relatively expanded whereas others report uniform PFC scaling. We address this controversy using MRI-derived cortical surfaces of many individual humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. We present two parcellation-based PFC delineations based on cytoarchitecture and function and show that a previously used morphological surrogate (cortex anterior to the genu of the corpus callosum) substantially underestimates PFC extent, especially in humans. We find that the proportion of cortical gray matter occupied by PFC in humans is up to 86% larger than in macaques and 24% larger than in chimpanzees. The disparity is even greater for PFC white matter volume, which is 140% larger in humans compared to macaques and 71% larger than in chimpanzees.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Estimating the functional dimensionality of neural representations, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent advances in multivariate fMRI analysis stress the importance of information inherent to voxel patterns. Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signal’s functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTDopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) and are proposed to mediate error-driven learning. However the learning strategy engaged by DA-RPEs remains controversial. Model-free associations imbue cueactions with pure value, independently of representations of their associated outcome. In contrast, model-based associations support detailed representation of anticipated outcomes. Here we show that although both VTA and SNc DA neuron activation reinforces instrumental responding, only VTA DA neuron activation during consumption of expected sucrose reward restores error-driven learning and promotes formation of a new cue→sucrose association. Critically, expression of VTA DA-dependent Pavlovian associations is abolished following sucrose devaluation, a signature of model-based learning. These findings reveal that activation of VTA-or SNc-DA neurons engages largely dissociable learning processes with VTA-DA neurons capable of participating in model-based predictive learning, while the role of SNc-DA neurons appears limited to reinforcement of instrumental responses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ultrafast glutamate sensors resolve high-frequency release at Schaffer collateral synapses, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTGlutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to ∼10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 μM and 600 μM, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitationdepression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.Significance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Optogenetic dissection of descending behavioral control in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2017-12-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how these neurons control an insect’s movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a population of descending neurons, we found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</p>
