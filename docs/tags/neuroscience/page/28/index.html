          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Non-invasive laminar inference with MEG Comparison of methods and source inversion algorithms, bioRxiv, 2017-06-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is a direct measure of neuronal current flow; its anatomical resolution is therefore not constrained by physiology but rather by data quality and the models used to explain these data. Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms. This possibility can now be achieved using recent developments in high precision MEG, most notably the use of subject-specific head-casts, which allow for significant increases in data quality and therefore anatomically precise MEG recordings.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distinct neuronal activity patterns induce different gene expression programs, bioRxiv, 2017-06-06</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYBrief and sustained neuronal activity patterns can have opposite effects on synaptic strength that both require activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression. However, whether distinct patterns of activity induce different sets of ARGs is unknown. In genome-scale experiments, we reveal that a neuron’s activity-pattern history can be predicted from the ARGs it expresses. Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPKERK signaling for their induction. MAPKERK mediates rapid RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters, as well as enhancer RNA induction but not histone acetylation at enhancers. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of ARG induction also enable different sets of genes to be induced by distinct activity patterns.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sex differences in the adult human brain Evidence from 5,216 UK Biobank participants, bioRxiv, 2017-04-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractSex differences in the human brain are of interest, for example because of sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits. We report the largest single-sample study of structural and functional sex differences in the human brain (2,750 female, 2,466 male participants; 44-77 years). Males had higher volumes, surface areas, and white matter fractional anisotropy; females had thicker cortices and higher white matter tract complexity. There was considerable distributional overlap between the sexes. Subregional differences were not fully attributable to differences in total volume or height. There was generally greater male variance across structural measures. Functional connectome organization showed stronger connectivity for males in unimodal sensorimotor cortices, and stronger connectivity for females in the default mode network. This large-scale study provides a foundation for attempts to understand the causes and consequences of sex differences in adult brain structure and function.</p>

          <p>AbstractHere we establish that, contrary to expectations, Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms possess a color discrimination system despite lacking any opsin or other known visible light photoreceptor genes. We found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. Absorption of amber light by this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance. By combining narrow-band blue and amber light sources, we demonstrated that detection of the specific blueamber ratio by the worm guides its foraging decision. These behavioral and psychophysical studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Empirical assessment of published effect sizes and power in the recent cognitive neuroscience and psychology literature, bioRxiv, 2016-08-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe have empirically assessed the distribution of published effect sizes and estimated power by extracting more than 100,000 statistical records from about 10,000 cognitive neuroscience and psychology papers published during the past 5 years. The reported median effect size was d=0.93 (inter-quartile range 0.64-1.46) for nominally statistically significant results and d=0.24 (0.11-0.42) for non-significant results. Median power to detect small, medium and large effects was 0.12, 0.44 and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. Power was lowest for cognitive neuroscience journals. 14% of papers reported some statistically significant results, although the respective F statistic and degrees of freedom proved that these were non-significant; p value errors positively correlated with journal impact factors. False report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature. In light of our findings the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cytoarchitectonic similarity is a wiring principle of the human connectome, bioRxiv, 2016-08-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding the wiring diagram of the human cerebral cortex is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Elemental aspects of its organization remain elusive. Here we examine which structural traits of cortical regions, particularly their cytoarchitecture and thickness, relate to the existence and strength of inter-regional connections. We use the architecture data from the classic work of von Economo and Koskinas and state-of-the-art diffusion-based connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results reveal a prominent role of the cytoarchitectonic similarity of supragranular layers for predicting the existence and strength of connections. In contrast, cortical thickness similarity was not related to the existence or strength of connections. These results are in line with findings for non-human mammalian cerebral cortices, suggesting overarching wiring principles of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The results invite hypotheses about evolutionary conserved neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to the relation of cytoarchitecture and connectivity in the human cerebral cortex.</p>
