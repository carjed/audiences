          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A theory of multineuronal dimensionality, dynamics and measurement, bioRxiv, 2017-11-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn many experiments, neuroscientists tightly control behavior, record many trials, and obtain trial-averaged firing rates from hundreds of neurons in circuits containing billions of behaviorally relevant neurons. Di-mensionality reduction methods reveal a striking simplicity underlying such multi-neuronal data they can be reduced to a low-dimensional space, and the resulting neural trajectories in this space yield a remarkably insightful dynamical portrait of circuit computation. This simplicity raises profound and timely conceptual questions. What are its origins and its implications for the complexity of neural dynamics? How would the situation change if we recorded more neurons? When, if at all, can we trust dynamical portraits obtained from measuring an infinitesimal fraction of task relevant neurons? We present a theory that answers these questions, and test it using physiological recordings from reaching monkeys. This theory reveals conceptual insights into how task complexity governs both neural dimensionality and accurate recovery of dynamic portraits, thereby providing quantitative guidelines for future large-scale experimental design.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Unsupervised discovery of demixed, low-dimensional neural dynamics across multiple timescales through tensor components analysis, bioRxiv, 2017-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractPerceptions, thoughts and actions unfold over millisecond timescales, while learned behaviors can require many days to mature. While recent experimental advances enable large-scale and long-term neural recordings with high temporal fidelity, it remains a formidable challenge to extract unbiased and interpretable descriptions of how rapid single-trial circuit dynamics change slowly over many trials to mediate learning. We demonstrate a simple tensor components analysis (TCA) can meet this challenge by extracting three interconnected low dimensional descriptions of neural data neuron factors, reflecting cell assemblies; temporal factors, reflecting rapid circuit dynamics mediating perceptions, thoughts, and actions within each trial; and trial factors, describing both long-term learning and trial-to-trial changes in cognitive state. We demonstrate the broad applicability of TCA by revealing insights into diverse datasets derived from artificial neural networks, large-scale calcium imaging of rodent prefrontal cortex during maze navigation, and multielectrode recordings of macaque motor cortex during brain machine interface learning.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Mapping the human brain&#39;s cortical-subcortical functional network organization, bioRxiv, 2017-10-20</h4>
          <p>Understanding complex systems such as the human brain requires characterization of the system&#39;s architecture across multiple levels of organization - from neurons, to local circuits, to brain regions, and ultimately large-scale brain networks. Here we focus on characterizing the human brain&#39;s large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems, calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions, we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently-identified networks, including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 358 highly-organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably, the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels (360). This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework, with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Discrete attractor dynamics underlying selective persistent activity in frontal cortex, bioRxiv, 2017-10-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractShort-term memories link events separated in time, such as past sensation and future actions. Short-term memories are correlated with selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this persistent activity we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modeling. During the delay epoch, both membrane potential and population activity of ALM neurons funneled towards discrete endpoints related to specific movement directions. These endpoints were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other endpoint, followed by incorrect actions. Our results are consistent with discrete attractor dynamics underlying short-term memory related to motor planning.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-Precision Automated Reconstruction of Neurons with Flood-filling Networks, bioRxiv, 2017-10-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractReconstruction of neural circuits from volume electron microscopy data requires the tracing of complete cells including all their neurites. Automated approaches have been developed to perform the tracing, but without costly human proofreading their error rates are too high to obtain reliable circuit diagrams. We present a method for automated segmentation that, like the majority of previous efforts, employs convolutional neural networks, but contains in addition a recurrent pathway that allows the iterative optimization and extension of the reconstructed shape of individual neural processes. We used this technique, which we call flood-filling networks, to trace neurons in a data set obtained by serial block-face electron microscopy from a male zebra finch brain. Our method achieved a mean error-free neurite path length of 1.1 mm, an order of magnitude better than previously published approaches applied to the same dataset. Only 4 mergers were observed in a neurite test set of 97 mm path length.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Predictive Coding of Novel versus Familiar Stimuli in the Primary Visual Cortex, bioRxiv, 2017-10-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo explore theories of predictive coding, we presented mice with repeated sequences of images with novel images sparsely substituted. Under these conditions, mice could be rapidly trained to lick in response to a novel image, demonstrating a high level of performance on the first day of testing. Using 2-photon calcium imaging to record from layer 23 neurons in the primary visual cortex, we found that novel images evoked excess activity in the majority of neurons. When a new stimulus sequence was repeatedly presented, a majority of neurons had similarly elevated activity for the first few presentations, which then decayed to almost zero activity. The decay time of these transient responses was not fixed, but instead scaled with the length of the stimulus sequence. However, at the same time, we also found a small fraction of the neurons within the population (∼2%) that continued to respond strongly and periodically to the repeated stimulus. Decoding analysis demonstrated that both the transient and sustained responses encoded information about stimulus identity. We conclude that the layer 23 population uses a two-channel predictive code a dense transient code for novel stimuli and a sparse sustained code for familiar stimuli. These results extend and unify existing theories about the nature of predictive neural codes.</p>
