          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modulation of visual cortex by hippocampal signals, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25</h4>
          <p>Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are influenced by the animal’s position in the environment and encode positions that correlate with those encoded by hippocampus (CA1). Might V1’s encoding of spatial positions be inherited from hippocampal regions? If so, it should depend on non-visual factors that affect the encoding of position in hippocampus, such as the physical distance traveled and the phase of theta oscillations. We recorded V1 and CA1 neurons while mice ran through a virtual corridor and confirmed these predictions. Spatial representations in V1 and CA1 were correlated even in the absence of visual cues. Moreover, similar to CA1 place cells, the spatial responses of V1 neurons were influenced by the physical distance traveled and the phase of hippocampal theta oscillations. These results reveal a modulation of cortical sensory processing by non-sensory estimates of position that might originate in hippocampal regions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Relationship between cardiac cycle and the timing of actions during action execution and observation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractPrevious research suggests that there may be a relationship between the timing of motor events and phases of the cardiac cycle. However, this relationship has thus far only been researched using simple isolated movements such as key-presses in reaction-time tasks and only in a single subject acting alone. Here, we investigated how the cardiac cycle relates to ongoing self-paced movements in both action execution and observation using a novel dyadic paradigm. We recorded electrocardiography (ECG) in 26 subjects who formed 13 dyads containing an action executioner and observer as they performed a self-paced sequence of movements. We demonstrated that heartbeats are timed to movements during both action execution and observation. Specifically, movements were more likely to culminate between heartbeats than simultaneously with the heartbeat. The same pattern was observed for action observation, with the observer’s heartbeats occurring off-phase with movement culmination. These findings demonstrate that there is synchronicity between an action executioner’s cardiac cycle and the timing of their movements, and that the same relationship is mirrored in an observer. This suggests that interpersonal synchronicity may be caused by the mirroring of a phasic relationship between movement and the heart.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A Critique of Pure Learning What Artificial Neural Networks can Learn from Animal Brains, bioRxiv, 2019-03-20</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTOver the last decade, artificial neural networks (ANNs), have undergone a revolution, catalyzed in large part by better tools for supervised learning. However, training such networks requires enormous data sets of labeled examples, whereas young animals (including humans) typically learn with few or no labeled examples. This stark contrast with biological learning has led many in the ANN community posit that instead of supervised paradigms, animals must rely instead primarily on unsupervised learning, leading the search for better unsupervised algorithms. Here we argue that much of an animal’s behavioral repertoire is not the result of clever learning algorithms—supervised or unsupervised—but arises instead from behavior programs already present at birth. These programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly. Recognizing the importance of the highly structured connectivity suggests a path toward building ANNs capable of rapid learning.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Variations in Structural MRI Quality Impact Measures of Brain Anatomy Relations with Age and Other Sociodemographic Variables, bioRxiv, 2019-03-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn-scanner head movements can introduce artifacts to MRI images and increase errors in brain-behavior studies. The magnitude of in-scanner head movements varies widely across developmental and clinical samples, making it increasingly difficult to parse out “true signal” from motion related noise. Yet, the quantification of structural imaging quality is typically limited to subjective visual assessments andor proxy measures of motion. It is, however, unknown how direct measures of image quality relate to developmental and behavioral variables, as well as measures of brain morphometrics. To begin to answer this question, we leverage a multi-site dataset of structural MRI images, which includes a range of children and adolescents with varying degrees of psychopathology. We first find that a composite of structural image quality relates to important developmental and behavioral variables (e.g., IQ; clinical diagnoses). Additionally, we demonstrate that even among T1-weighted images which pass visual inspection, variations in image quality impact volumetric derivations of regional gray matter. Image quality was associated with wide-spread variations in gray matter, including in portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the cerebellum. Further, our image quality composite partially mediated the relationship between age and total gray matter volume, explaining 23% of this relationship. Collectively, the effects underscore the need for volumetric studies to model or mitigate the effect of image quality when investigating brain-behavior relations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The “sewing machine” for minimally invasive neural recording, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe present a system for scalable and customizable recording and stimulation of neural activity. In large animals and humans, the current benchmark for high spatial and temporal resolution neural interfaces are fixed arrays of wire or silicon electrodes inserted into the parenchyma of the brain. However, probes that are large and stiff enough to penetrate the brain have been shown to cause acute and chronic damage and inflammation, which limits their longevity, stability, and yield. One approach to this problem is to separate the requirements of the insertion device, which should to be as stiff as possible, with the implanted device, which should be as small and flexible as possible. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach with a system incorporating fine and flexible thin-film polymer probes, a fine and stiff insertion needle, and a robotic insertion machine. Together the system permits rapid and precise implantation of probes, each individually targeted to avoid observable vasculature and to attain diverse anatomical targets. As an initial demonstration of this system, we implanted arrays of electrodes in rat somatosensory cortex, recorded extracellular action potentials from them, and obtained histological images of the tissue response. This approach points the way toward a new generation of scaleable, stable, and safe neural interfaces, both for the basic scientific study of brain function and for clinical applications.</p>
