          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomic decoding of neuronal depolarization by stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers, bioRxiv, 2019-03-04</h4>
          <p>Cells regulate gene expression in response to salient external stimuli. In neurons, depolarization leads to the expression of inducible transcription factors (ITFs) that direct subsequent gene regulation. Depolarization encodes both neuronal action potential (AP) output and synaptic inputs, via excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). However, it is unclear if different types of depolarizing signals can be transformed by an ITF into distinct modes of genomic regulation. Here, we show that APs and EPSPs in the murine hippocampus trigger two spatially segregated and molecularly distinct mechanisms that lead to the expression of the ITF NPAS4. These two pathways culminate in the assembly of unique, stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers that exhibit distinctive DNA binding patterns. Thus, NPAS4 independently communicates increases in neuronal spiking output and synaptic inputs to the nucleus, enabling gene regulation to be tailored to the type of depolarizing activity experienced by a neuron.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Brain Aging in Major Depressive Disorder Results from the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder working group, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an increased risk of brain atrophy, aging-related diseases, and mortality. We examined potential advanced brain aging in MDD patients, and whether this process is associated with clinical characteristics in a large multi-center international dataset. Methods We performed a mega-analysis by pooling brain measures derived from T1-weighted MRI scans from 29 samples worldwide. Normative brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age (10-75 years) from 7 subcortical volumes, 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area, lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 1,147 male and 1,386 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group. The learned model parameters were applied to 1,089 male controls and 1,167 depressed males, and 1,326 female controls and 2,044 depressed females to obtain independent unbiased brain-based age predictions. The difference between predicted brain age and chronological age was calculated to indicate brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD). Findings On average, MDD patients showed a higher brain-PAD of &#43;0.90 (SE 0.21) years (Cohen&#39;s d=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.17) compared to controls. Relative to controls, first-episode and currently depressed patients showed higher brain-PAD (&#43;1.2 [0.3] years), and the largest effect was observed in those with late-onset depression (&#43;1.7 [0.7] years). In addition, higher brain-PAD was associated with higher self-reported depressive symptomatology (b=0.05, p=0.004). Interpretation This highly powered collaborative effort showed subtle patterns of abnormal structural brain aging in MDD. Substantial within-group variance and overlap between groups were observed. Longitudinal studies of MDD and somatic health outcomes are needed to further assess the predictive value of these brain-PAD estimates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability in large-scale brain systems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Many studies of large-scale neural systems have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations (functional connectivity) during task states relative to resting state. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations&#39; dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Global Signal Regression Strengthens Association between Resting-State Functional Connectivity and Behavior, bioRxiv, 2019-02-14</h4>
          <p>Global signal regression (GSR) is one of the most debated preprocessing strategies for resting-state functional MRI. GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures. Code for the variance component model and ridge regression can be found here httpsgithub.comThomasYeoLabCBIGtreemasterstable_projectspreprocessingLi2019_GSR.</p>
