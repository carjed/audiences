          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ultrafast glutamate sensors resolve high-frequency release at Schaffer collateral synapses, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTGlutamatergic synapses display a rich repertoire of plasticity mechanisms on many different time scales, involving dynamic changes in the efficacy of transmitter release as well as changes in the number and function of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to ∼10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 μM and 600 μM, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitationdepression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.Significance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.</p>

          <p>AbstractIn most animals, the brain makes behavioral decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how these neurons control an insect’s movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial D. melanogaster. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a population of descending neurons, we found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Generative adversarial networks for reconstructing natural images from brain activity, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe explore a method for reconstructing visual stimuli from brain activity. Using large databases of natural images we trained a deep convolutional generative adversarial network capable of generating gray scale photos, similar to stimUli presented during two functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments. Using a linear model we learned to predict the generative model’s latent space from measured brain activity. The objective was to create an image similar to the presented stimulus image through the previously trained generator. Using this approach we were able to reconstruct structural and some semantic features of a proportion of the natural images sets. A behavioral test showed that subjects were capable of identifying a reconstruction of the original stimuhis in 67.2% and 66.4% of the cases in a pairwise comparison for the two natural image datasets respectively. our approach does not require end-to-end training of a large generative model on limited neuroimaging data. Rapid advances in generative modeling promise further improvements in reconstruction performance.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractOptogenetic silencing allows time-resolved functional interrogation of defined neuronal populations. However, the limitations of inhibitory optogenetic tools impose stringent constraints on experimental paradigms. The high light power requirement of light-driven ion pumps and their effects on intracellular ion homeostasis pose unique challenges, particularly in experiments that demand inhibition of a widespread neuronal population in vivo. Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (GtACRs) are promising in this regard, due to their high single-channel conductance and favorable photon-ion stoichiometry. However, GtACRs show poor membrane targeting in mammalian cells, and the activity of such channels can cause transient excitation in the axon due to an excitatory chloride reversal potential in this compartment. Here we address both problems by enhancing membrane targeting and subcellular compartmentalization of GtACRs. The resulting GtACR-based optogenetic tools show improved photocurrents, greatly reduced axonal excitation, high light sensitivity and rapid kinetics, allowing highly efficient inhibition of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas, bioRxiv, 2017-12-07</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTNeocortex contains a multitude of cell types segregated into layers and functionally distinct regions. To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the primary visual cortex (VISp), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) by deep single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic types were found in either VISp or ALM, with only three present in both. By combining single cell RNA-seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.</p>
