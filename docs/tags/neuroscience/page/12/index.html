          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Does testosterone impair mens&#39; cognitive empathy? Evidence from two large-scale randomized controlled trials Supplementary material, bioRxiv, 2019-01-13</h4>
          <p>The capacity to infer the mental states of others (known as cognitive empathy) is essential for social interactions, and a well-known theory proposes that it is negatively affected by intrauterine testosterone exposure. Furthermore, previous studies reported that testosterone administration impaired cognitive empathy in healthy adults, and that a biomarker of prenatal testosterone exposure (finger digit ratios) moderated the effect. However, empirical support for the relationship has relied on small-sample studies with mixed evidence. We investigate the reliability and generalizability of the relationship in two large-scale double-blind placebo-controlled experiments in young men (N=243 and N=400), using two different testosterone administration protocols. We find no evidence that cognitive empathy is impaired by testosterone administration or associated with digit ratios. With an unprecedented combined sample size, these results counter current theories and previous high-profile reports, and demonstrate that previous investigations of this topic have been statistically underpowered.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Insulin enhances presynaptic glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens via opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>Insulin influences learning and cognition and activity in brain centers that mediate reward and motivation in humans. However, very little is known about how insulin influences excitatory transmission within brain reward centers such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Further, insulin dysregulation that accompanies obesity is linked to cognitive decline, depression, anxiety, and aberrant motivation that also rely on excitatory transmission in the NAc, but potential mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that insulin receptor activation increases presynaptic glutamate release via a previously unidentified form of opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, whereas activation of IGF receptors by insulin decreases presynaptic glutamate release in the NAc. Furthermore, obesity results in a loss of the insulin receptor-mediated increases and a reduction in NAc insulin receptor surface expression, while preserving reductions in excitatory transmission mediated by IGF receptors. These results provide the first insights into how insulin influences excitatory transmission in the adult brain and have broad implications for the regulation of motivation and reward related processes by peripheral hormones.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Individual-Specific fMRI-Subspaces Improve Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior Supplemental, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10</h4>
          <p>There is significant interest in using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) to predict human behavior. Good behavioral prediction should in theory require RSFC to be sufficiently distinct across participants; if RSFC were the same across participants, then behavioral prediction would obviously be poor. Therefore, we hypothesize that removing common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals that are shared across participants would improve behavioral prediction. Here, we considered 803 participants from the human connectome project (HCP) with four rs-fMRI runs. We applied the common and orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) technique to decompose each HCP run into two subspaces a common (group-level) subspace shared across all participants and a subject-specific subspace. We found that the first common COBE component of the first HCP run was localized to the visual cortex and was unique to the run. On the other hand, the second common COBE component of the first HCP run and the first common COBE component of the remaining HCP runs were highly similar and localized to regions within the default network, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Overall, this suggests the presence of run-specific (state-specific) effects that were shared across participants. By removing the first and second common COBE components from the first HCP run, and the first common COBE component from the remaining HCP runs, the resulting RSFC improves behavioral prediction by an average of 11.7% across 58 behavioral measures spanning cognition, emotion and personality.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The population dynamics of a canonical cognitive circuit Supplementary Information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10</h4>
          <p>The brain constructs distributed representations of key low-dimensional variables. These variables may be external stimuli or internal constructs of quantities relevant for survival, such as a sense of one&#39;s location in the world. We consider that the high-dimensional population-level activity vectors are the fundamental representational currency of a neural circuit, and these vectors trace out a low-dimensional manifold whose dimension and topology matches those of the represented variable. This manifold perspective -- applied to the mammalian head direction circuit across rich waking behaviors and sleep -- enables powerful inferences about circuit representation and mechanism, including Direct visualization and blind discovery that the network represents a one-dimensional circular variable across waking and REM sleep; fully unsupervised decoding of the coded variable; stability and attractor dynamics in the representation; the discovery of new dynamical trajectories during sleep; the limiting role of external rather than internal noise in the fidelity of memory states; and the conclusion that the circuit is set up to integrate velocity inputs according to classical continuous attractor models.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">False-positive neuroimaging Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding, bioRxiv, 2019-01-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractHypothesis testing in neuroimaging studies relies heavily on treating named anatomical regions (e.g., “the amygdala”) as unitary entities. Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on “amygdala activity” does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as “model degrees of freedom.” From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the ‘replicated’ findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the ‘original’ findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings. Techniques reviewed here include permutation tests on peak distance, Bayesian MANOVA, and a priori multivariate pattern-based models. These practices will help researchers to establish precise and falsifiable spatial hypotheses, promoting a cumulative science of neuroimaging.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Optical clearing of living brains with MAGICAL to extend in vivo imaging, bioRxiv, 2019-01-09</h4>
          <p>To understand brain functions, it is important to observe directly how multiple neural circuits are performing in living brains. However, due to tissue opaqueness, observable depth and spatiotemporal resolution are severely degraded in vivo. Here, we propose an optical brain clearing method for in vivo fluorescence microscopy, termed MAGICAL (Magical Additive Glycerol Improves Clear Alive Luminance). MAGICAL enabled two-photon microscopy to capture vivid images with fast speed, at cortical layer V and hippocampal CA1 in vivo. Moreover, MAGICAL promoted conventional confocal microscopy to visualize finer neuronal structures including synaptic boutons and spines in unprecedented deep regions, without intensive illumination leading to phototoxic effects. Fluorescence Emission Spectrum Transmissive Analysis (FESTA) showed that MAGICAL improved in vivo transmittance of shorter wavelength light, which is vulnerable to optical scattering thus unsuited for in vivo microscopy. These results suggest that MAGICAL would transparentize living brains via scattering reduction.</p>
