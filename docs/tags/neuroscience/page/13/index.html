          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Associations between vascular risk factors and brain MRI indices in UK Biobank Supplementary Material, bioRxiv, 2019-01-04</h4>
          <p>Aims Several factors are known to increase risk for cerebrovascular disease and dementia, but there is limited evidence on associations between multiple vascular risk factors (VRFs) and detailed aspects of brain macro- and microstructure in large community-dwelling populations across middle- and older age. Methods and Results Associations between VRFs (smoking, hypertension, pulse pressure, diabetes, hypercholersterolaemia, BMI, and waist-hip ratio) and both global and regional brain structural and diffusion MRI markers were examined in UK Biobank (N = 9722, age range 44-77 years). A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R2 ≤ 1.8%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker. Conclusion Higher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macro- and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres. Though effect sizes were small, these results emphasise the vulnerability of brain health to vascular factors even in relatively healthy middle and older age, and the potential to partly ameliorate cognitive decline by addressing these malleable risk factors.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Enjoy The Violence Is appreciation for extreme music the result of cognitive control over the threat response system?, bioRxiv, 2019-01-03</h4>
          <p>Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesn&#39;t for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans&#39; appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">General visual and contingent thermal cues interact to elicit attraction in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, bioRxiv, 2019-01-03</h4>
          <p>Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes use multiple sensory modalities to hunt human hosts to obtain a blood-meal for egg production. Attractive cues include carbon dioxide (CO2), a major component of exhaled breath [1, 2]; heat elevated above ambient temperature, signifying warm-blooded skin [3, 4]; and dark visual contrast [5, 6], proposed to bridge long-range olfactory and short-range thermal cues [7]. Any of these sensory cues in isolation is an incomplete signal of a human host, and so a mosquito must integrate multi-modal sensory information before committing to approaching and biting a person [8]. Here, we study the interaction of visual cues, heat, and CO2 to investigate the contributions of human-associated stimuli to host-seeking decisions. We show that tethered flying mosquitoes strongly orient toward dark visual contrast regardless of CO2 stimulation and internal host-seeking status. This suggests that attraction to visual contrast is general, and not contingent on other host cues. In free-flight experiments with CO2, adding a dark contrasting visual cue to a warmed surface enhanced host-seeking. Moderate warmth became more attractive to mosquitoes, and mosquitoes aggregated on the cue at all non-noxious temperatures. Gr3 mutants, unable to detect CO2, were lured to the visual cue at ambient temperatures, but fled and did not return when the surface was warmed to host-like temperatures. This suggests that attraction to thermal cues is contingent on the presence of the additional human sensory cue CO2. Our results illustrate that mosquitoes integrate general attractive visual stimuli with the context-dependent thermal stimuli to seek promising sites for blood-feeding.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fundamental bounds on learning performance in neural circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-01-01</h4>
          <p>How does the size of a neural circuit influence its learning performance? Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size, the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and intrinsic noise in neural circuits.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Loud music and the specific sound stress open the blood-brain barrier new fundamental, biomedical, and social aspects, bioRxiv, 2019-01-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for drug brain delivery. The limitation of our knowledge about the nature of BBB explains the slow progress in the therapy of brain diseases and absence of methods for drug brain delivery in the clinical practice.Here we show that BBB opens for lowhigh weight molecules and nanocarriers after exposure of loud musicsound of 90 dB and 100 dB (regardless its frequency) as being easily produced by MP3MP4 players, kitchen appliances, loudspeakers at concerts. The role of sound, sound-induced stress and molecular mechanisms behind is discussed in the framework of BBB opening as an informative platform for a novel fundamental knowledge about the nature of BBB and for the development of a non-invasive brain drug delivery technology.Social aspects of musicsound-induced opening of BBB provide completely new information about noise and healthy life conditions that will stimulate new research in this field.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inception in visual cortex in vivo-silico loops reveal most exciting images, bioRxiv, 2018-12-29</h4>
          <p>Much of our knowledge about sensory processing in the brain is based on quasi-linear models and the stimuli that optimally drive them. However, sensory information processing is nonlinear, even in primary sensory areas, and optimizing sensory input is difficult due to the high-dimensional input space. We developed inception loops, a closed-loop experimental paradigm that combines in vivo recordings with in silico nonlinear response modeling to identify the Most Exciting Images (MEIs) for neurons in mouse V1. When presented back to the brain, MEIs indeed drove their target cells significantly better than the best stimuli identified by linear models. The MEIs exhibited complex spatial features that deviated from the textbook ideal of V1 as a bank of Gabor filters. Inception loops represent a widely applicable new approach to dissect the neural mechanisms of sensation.</p>
