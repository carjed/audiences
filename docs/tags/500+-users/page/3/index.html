          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single Cortical Neurons as Deep Artificial Neural Networks, bioRxiv, 2019-04-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe propose a novel approach based on modern deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) for understanding how the morpho-electrical complexity of neurons shapes their inputoutput (IO) properties at the millisecond resolution in response to massive synaptic input. The IO of integrate and fire point neuron is accurately captured by a DNN with a single unit and one hidden layer. A fully connected DNN with one hidden layer faithfully replicated the IO relationship of a detailed model of Layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell (L5PC) receiving AMPA and GABAA synapses. However, when adding voltage-gated NMDA-conductances, a temporally-convolutional DNN with seven layers was required. Analysis of the DNN filters provides new insights into dendritic processing shaping the IO properties of neurons. This work proposes a systematic approach for characterizing the functional “depth” of a biological neurons, suggesting that cortical pyramidal neurons and the networks they form are computationally much more powerful than previously assumed.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic compensation triggered by mutant mRNA degradation, Nature, 2019-04-03</h4>
          <p>Genetic robustness, or the ability of an organism to maintain fitness in the presence of harmful mutations, can be achieved via protein feedback loops. Previous work has suggested that organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional adaptation, a process by which related gene(s) are upregulated independently of protein feedback loops. However, the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, by analysing several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse, we uncover a requirement for mutant mRNA degradation. Alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional adaptation, and these alleles give rise to more severe phenotypes than alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay reveals the upregulation of a substantial proportion of the genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene&#39;s mRNA, suggesting a sequence-dependent mechanism. These findings have implications for our understanding of disease-causing mutations, and will help in the design of mutant alleles with minimal transcriptional adaptation-derived compensation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clinical use of current polygenic risk scores may exacerbate health disparities, Nature Genetics, 2019-03-29</h4>
          <p>Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that—unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations—clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, greater diversity must be prioritized in genetic studies, and summary statistics must be publically disseminated to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those individuals already most underserved.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Recovery of trait heritability from whole genome sequence data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractHeritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors, can be estimated from pedigree data 1, but such estimates are uninformative with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on unrelated individuals have shown that for human traits and disease, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs 2–5. It is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular if the causal variants are rare, or other reasons such as over-estimation of heritability from pedigree data. Here we show that pedigree heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) appears to be fully recovered from whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on 21,620 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We assigned 47.1 million genetic variants to groups based upon their minor allele frequencies (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants nearby, and estimated and partitioned variation accordingly. The estimated heritability was 0.79 (SE 0.09) for height and 0.40 (SE 0.09) for BMI, consistent with pedigree estimates. Low-MAF variants in low LD with neighbouring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein altering variants, consistent with negative selection thereon. Cumulatively variants in the MAF range of 0.0001 to 0.1 explained 0.54 (SE 0.05) and 0.51 (SE 0.11) of heritability for height and BMI, respectively. Our results imply that the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease is accounted for by rare variants, in particular those in regions of low LD.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The life of P.I. Transitions to Independence in Academia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>The data in this report summarises the responses gathered from 365 principal investigators of academic laboratories, who started their independent positions in the UK within the last 6 years up to 2018. We find that too many new investigators express frustration and poor optimism for the future. These data also reveal, that many of these individuals lack the support required to make a successful transition to independence and that simple measures could be put in place by both funders and universities in order to better support these early career researchers. We use these data to make both recommendations of good practice and for changes to policies that would make significant improvements to those currently finding independence challenging. We find that some new investigators face significant obstacles when building momentum and hiring a research team. In particular, access to PhD students. We also find some important areas such as starting salaries where significant gender differences persist, which cannot be explained by seniority. Our data also underlines the importance of support networks, within and outside the department, and the positive influence of good mentorship through this difficult career stage.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Slide-seq A Scalable Technology for Measuring Genome-Wide Expression at High Spatial Resolution, bioRxiv, 2019-03-01</h4>
          <p>The spatial organization of cells in tissue has a profound influence on their function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. Here, we introduce Slide-seq, a highly scalable method that enables facile generation of large volumes of unbiased spatial transcriptomes with 10 micron spatial resolution, comparable to the size of individual cells. In Slide-seq, RNA is transferred from freshly frozen tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the spatial locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. To demonstrate Slide-seq&#39;s utility, we localized cell types identified by large-scale scRNA-seq datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus. We next systematically characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, identifying new axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. Finally, we used Slide-seq to define the temporal evolution of cell-type-specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. Slide-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine, high-resolution spatial mapping of gene expression.</p>
