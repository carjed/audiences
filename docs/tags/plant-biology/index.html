          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Design of a biosensor for direct visualisation of auxin, bioRxiv, 2020-01-20</h4>
          <p>In plants, one of the most important regulative small molecules is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) known as auxin. Its dynamic redistribution plays an essential role in virtually every aspect of plant life, ranging from cell shape and division to organogenesis and responses to light and gravity1,2. So far, the spatial and temporal distribution of auxin at cellular resolution could not be determined directly. Instead it has been inferred from visualisation of irreversible processes involving the endogenous auxin response machinery3-7. This detection system failed to record transient changes. Here we report on a genetically encoded biosensor for quantitative in vivo visualisation of auxin distributions. The sensor is based on the E. coli tryptophan repressor (TrpR)8 whose binding pocket was engineered for specific IAA binding and coupled to fluorescent proteins to employ FRET as readout. This sensor, unlike previous systems, enables direct monitoring of the fast uptake and clearance of auxin by individual cells in the plant as well as the graded spatial distribution along the root axis and its perturbation by transport inhibitors. Thus, our auxin sensor enables mapping of auxin concentrations at (sub)cellular resolution and their changes in time and space during plant life.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate and Versatile 3D Segmentation of Plant Tissues at Cellular Resolution, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTQuantitative analysis of plant and animal morphogenesis requires accurate segmentation of individual cells in volumetric images of growing organs. In the last years, deep learning has provided robust automated algorithms that approach human performance, with applications to bio-image analysis now starting to emerge. Here, we present PlantSeg, a pipeline for volumetric segmentation of plant tissues into cells. PlantSeg employs a convolutional neural network to predict cell boundaries and graph partitioning to segment cells based on the neural network predictions. PlantSeg was trained on fixed and live plant organs imaged with confocal and light sheet microscopes. PlantSeg delivers accurate results and generalizes well across different tissues, scales, and acquisition settings. We present results of PlantSeg applications in diverse developmental contexts. PlantSeg is free and open-source, with both a command line and a user-friendly graphical interface.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Plant Small RNA Species Direct Gene Silencing in Pathogenic Bacteria as well as Disease Protection, bioRxiv, 2019-12-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractPlant small RNAs (sRNAs) andor double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) trigger RNA interference (RNAi) in interacting eukaryotic pathogens or parasites. However, it is unknown whether this phenomenon could operate in bacterial phytopathogens, which lack a eukaryotic-like RNAi machinery. Here, we first show that Arabidopsis-encoded inverted repeat transgenes trigger silencing of Pseudomonas syringae heterologous reporter and endogenous virulence-associated genes during infection. Antibacterial Gene Silencing (AGS) of the latter was associated with a reduced pathogenesis, which was also observed upon application of corresponding plant-derived RNAs onto wild-type plants prior to infection. We additionally demonstrate that sRNAs directed against virulence factor transcripts were causal for silencing and pathogenesis reduction, while cognate long dsRNAs were inactive. Overall, this study provides the first evidence that plant sRNAs can directly reprogram gene expression in a phytopathogenic bacterium and may have wider implications in the understanding of how plants regulate transcriptome, community composition and genome evolution of associated bacteria.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A simple method for spray-on gene editing in planta, bioRxiv, 2019-10-26</h4>
          <p>Potential innovation in Plant research using gene-edited and genetically modified plants is currently being hindered by inefficient and costly plant transformation. We show that carbon dots formed from natural materials (quasi-spherical, &amp;lt;10nm nanoparticles) can act as a fast vehicle for carrying plasmids into mature plant cells, resulting in transient plant transformation in a number of important crop species with no negative impacts on photosynthesis or growth. We further show that GFP, Cas9, and gRNA introduced into wheat via foliar application (spraying on) of plasmid coated carbon dots are expressed and, in the case of Cas9, make genome edits in SPO11 genes. Therefore, we present a protocol for spray-on gene editing that is simple, inexpensive, fast, transforms in planta, and is applicable to multiple crop species. We believe this technique creates many opportunities for the future of plant transformation in research and shows great promise for plant protein production systems.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Plants with self-sustained luminescence, bioRxiv, 2019-10-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn contrast to fluorescent proteins, light emission from luciferase reporters requires exogenous addition of a luciferin substrate. Bacterial bioluminescence has been the single exception, where an operon of five genes is sufficient to produce light autonomously. Although commonly used in prokaryotic hosts, toxicity of the aldehyde substrate has limited its use in eukaryotes1. Here we demonstrate autonomous luminescence in a multicellular eukaryotic organism by incorporating a recently discovered fungal bioluminescent system2 into tobacco plants. We monitored these light-emitting plants from germination to flowering, observing temporal and spatial patterns of luminescence across time scales from seconds to months. The dynamic patterns of luminescence reflected progression through developmental stages, circadian oscillations, transport, and response to injuries. As with other fluorescent and luminescent reporters, we anticipate that this system will be further engineered for varied purposes, especially where exogenous addition of substrate is undesirable.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High molecular weight DNA isolation method from diverse plant species for use with Oxford Nanopore sequencing, bioRxiv, 2019-09-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe ability to generate long reads on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform is dependent on the isolation of high molecular weight DNA free of impurities. For some taxa, this is relatively straightforward; however, for plants, the presence of cell walls and a diverse set of specialized metabolites such as lignin, phenolics, alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids present significant challenges in the generation of DNA suitable for production of long reads. Success in generating long read lengths and genome assemblies of plants has been reported using diverse DNA isolation methods, some of which were tailored to the target species andor required extensive labor. To avoid the need to optimize DNA isolation for each species, we developed a taxa-independent DNA isolation method that is relatively simple and efficient. This method expands on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies high molecular weight genomic DNA protocol from plant leaves and utilizes a conventional cetyl trimethylammonium bromide extraction followed by removal of impurities and short DNA fragments using commercially available kits that yielded robust N50 read lengths and yield on Oxford Nanopore Technologies flow cells.</p>
