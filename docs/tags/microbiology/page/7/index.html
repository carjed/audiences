          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Epigenetic suppression of interferon lambda receptor expression leads to enhanced HuNoV replication in vitro, bioRxiv, 2019-01-17</h4>
          <p>Human norovirus (HuNoV) is the main cause of gastroenteritis worldwide yet no therapeutics are currently available. Here, we utilize a human norovirus replicon in human gastric tumor (HGT) cells to identify host factors involved in promoting or inhibiting HuNoV replication. We observed that an IFN-cured population of replicon-harboring HGT cells (HGT-cured) was enhanced in their ability to replicate transfected HuNoV RNA compared to parental HGT cells, suggesting that differential gene expression in HGT-cured cells created an environment favouring norovirus replication. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially regulated in HGT-NV and HGT-cured compared to parental HGT cells. We found that the IFN lambda receptor alpha (IFNLR1) expression was highly reduced in HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells. All three cell lines responded to exogenous IFN-β by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), however, HGT-NV and HGT-cured failed to respond to exogenous IFN-λ. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity with 5-aza-2&#39;-deoxycytidine partially reactivated IFNLR1 expression in HGT-NV and IFN-cured cells suggesting that host adaptation occurred via epigenetic reprogramming. In line with this, ectopic expression of the IFN-λ receptor alpha rescued HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells response to IFN-λ. We conclude that type III IFN is important in inhibiting HuNoV replication in vitro and that the loss of IFNLR1 enhances replication of HuNoV. This study unravels for the first time epigenetic reprogramming of the interferon lambda receptor as a new mechanism of cellular adaptation during long-term RNA virus replication and shows that an endogenous level of interferon lambda signalling is able to control human norovirus replication.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale analyses of human microbiomes reveal thousands of small, novel genes and their predicted functions, bioRxiv, 2018-12-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractSmall proteins likely abound in prokaryotes, and may mediate much of the communication that occurs between organisms within a microbiome and their host. Unfortunately, small proteins are traditionally overlooked in biology, in part due to the computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify novel small proteins, we carried out a large comparative genomics study on 1,773 HMP human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites (mouth, gut, skin and vagina). We describe more than four thousand conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ~30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain, and almost half are not represented in reference genomes, emphasizing the incompleteness of knowledge in this space. Our analysis exposes putative novel ‘housekeeping’ small protein families, including a potential novel ribosomally associated protein, as well as ‘mammalian-specific’ or ‘human-specific’ protein families. By analyzing the genomic neighborhood of small genes, we pinpoint a subset of families that are potentially associated with defense against bacteriophage. Finally, we identify families that may be subject to horizontal transfer and are thus potentially involved in adaptation of bacteria to the changing human environment. Our study suggest that small proteins are highly abundant and that those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Real-time capture of horizontal gene transfers from gut microbiota by engineered CRISPR-Cas acquisition, bioRxiv, 2018-12-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is central to the adaptation and evolution of bacteria. However, our knowledge about the flow of genetic material within complex microbiomes is lacking; most studies of HGT rely on bioinformatic analyses of genetic elements maintained on evolutionary timescales or experimental measurements of phenotypically trackable markers (e.g. antibiotic resistance). Consequently, our knowledge of the capacity and dynamics of HGT in complex communities is limited. Here, we utilize the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process to detect HGT events from complex microbiota in real-time and at nucleotide resolution. In this system, a recording strain is exposed to a microbial sample, spacers are acquired from foreign transferred elements and permanently stored in genomic CRISPR arrays. Subsequently, sequencing and analysis of these spacers enables identification of the transferred elements. This approach allowed us to quantify transfer frequencies of individual mobile elements without the need for phenotypic markers or post-transfer replication. We show that HGT in human clinical fecal samples can be extensive and rapid, often involving multiple different plasmid types, with the IncX type being the most actively transferred. Importantly, the vast majority of transferred elements did not carry readily selectable phenotypic markers, highlighting the utility of our approach to reveal previously hidden real-time dynamics of mobile gene pools within complex microbiomes.</p>

          <p>AbstractRuminants provide essential nutrition for billions of people worldwide. The rumen is a specialised stomach adapted to the breakdown of plant-derived complex polysaccharides, and collectively the rumen microbiota encode the thousands of enzymes responsible. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of over 6.5 terabytes of Illumina and Nanopore sequence data, including assembly of 4941 metagenome-assembled genomes, and several single-contig, whole-chromosome assemblies of novel rumen bacteria. We also present the largest dataset of predicted proteins from the rumen, and provide rich annotation against public datasets. Together these data will form an essential part of future studies of rumen microbiome structure and function.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Insights from Bacillus anthracis strains isolated from permafrost in the tundra zone of Russia, bioRxiv, 2018-12-04</h4>
          <p>This article describes Bacillus anthracis strains isolated during an outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal Peninsula in the summer of 2016 and independently in Yakutia in 2015. A common feature of these strains is their conservation in permafrost, from which they were extracted either due to the thawing of permafrost (Yamal strains) or as the result of paleontological excavations (Yakut strains). All strains isolated on the Yamal share an identical genotype belonging to lineage B.Br.001002, pointing to a common source of infection in a territory over 250 km in length. In contrast, during the excavations in Yakutia, three genetically different strains were recovered from a single pit. One strain belongs to B.Br.001002, as the Yamal strains. Despite the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the B.Br.001002 strains are very closely related. The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in B. anthracis population. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to this polytomy is suggesting that this polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe. We propose an evolutionary model for B. anthracis recent evolution in which the B lineage spread throughout Eurasia and was subsequently replaced by the A lineage except in some geographically isolated areas.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quantitative PCR provides a simple and accessible method for quantitative microbiome profiling, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe use of relative next generation sequencing (NGS) abundance data can lead to misinterpretations of microbial community structures as the increase of one taxon leads to concurrent decrease of the other(s). To overcome compositionality, we provide a quantitative NGS solution, which is achieved by adjusting the relative 16S rRNA gene amplicon NGS data with quantitative PCR (qPCR-based) total bacterial counts. By comparing the enumeration of dominant bacterial groups on different taxonomic levels in human fecal samples using taxon-specific 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR we show that quantitative NGS is able to estimate absolute bacterial abundances accurately. We also observed a higher degree of correspondence in the estimated microbe-metabolite relationship when quantitative NGS was applied. Being conceptually and methodologically analogous to amplicon-based NGS, our qPCR-based method can be readily incorporated into the standard, high-throughput NGS sample processing pipeline for more accurate description of interactions within and between the microbes and host.</p>
