          <p>AbstractEnteroBase is an integrated software environment which supports the identification of global population structures within several bacterial genera including pathogens. It currently contains more than 300,000 genomes that have been assembled from Illumina short reads from the genera Salmonella, Escherichia, Yersinia, Clostridiodes, Helicobacter, Vibrio, and Moraxella. With the recent introduction of hierarchical clustering of core genome MLST sequence types, EnteroBase now facilitates the identification of close relatives of bacteria within those genera inside of a few hours of uploading their short reads. It also supports private collaborations between groups of users, and the comparison of genomic data that were assembled from short reads with SNP calls that were extracted from metagenomic sequences. Here we provide an overview for its users on how EnteroBase works, what it can do, and its future prospects. This user’s guide is illustrated by three case studies ranging in scale from the miniscule (local transmission of Salmonella between neighboring social groups of badgers) through pandemic transmission of plague and microevolution of Yersinia pestis over the last 5,000 years to a novel, global overview of the population structure of all of Escherichia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Antibiotics select for novel pathways of resistance in biofilms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractMost bacteria in nature exist in aggregated communities known as biofilms. Bacteria within biofilms are inherently highly resistant to antibiotics. Current understanding of the evolution and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is largely derived from work from cells in liquid culture and it is unclear whether biofilms adapt and evolve in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of drugs. Here we used a biofilm evolution model to show that biofilms of a model food borne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium rapidly evolve in response to exposure to three clinically important antibiotics. Whilst the model strongly selected for improved biofilm formation in the absence of any drug, once antibiotics were introduced the need to adapt to the drug was more important than the selection for improved biofilm formation. Adaptation to antibiotic stress imposed a marked cost in biofilm formation, particularly evident for populations exposed to cefotaxime and azithromycin. We identified distinct resistance phenotypes in biofilms compared to corresponding planktonic control cultures and characterised new mechanisms of resistance to cefotaxime and azithromycin. Novel substitutions within the multidrug efflux transporter, AcrB were identified and validated as impacting drug export as well as changes in regulators of this efflux system. There were clear fitness costs identified and associated with different evolutionary trajectories. Our results demonstrate that biofilms adapt rapidly to low concentrations of antibiotics and the mechanisms of adaptation are novel. This work will be a starting point for studies to further examine biofilm specific pathways of adaptation which inform future antibiotic use.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Mitigating Pandemic Risk with Influenza A Virus Field Surveillance at a Swine-Human Interface, bioRxiv, 2019-03-22</h4>
          <p>Working overnight at a large swine exhibition, we identified an influenza A virus (IAV) outbreak in swine, nanopore-sequenced 13 IAV genomes from samples collected, and in real-time, determined that these viruses posed a novel risk to humans due to genetic mismatches between the viruses and current pre-pandemic candidate vaccine viruses (CVV). We developed and used a portable IAV sequencing and analysis platform called Mia (Mobile Influenza Analysis) to complete and characterize full-length consensus genomes approximately 18 hours after unpacking the mobile lab. Swine are important animal IAV reservoirs that have given rise to pandemic viruses via zoonotic transmission. Genomic analyses of IAV in swine are critical to understanding pandemic risk of viruses in this reservoir, and characterization of viruses circulating in exhibition swine enables rapid comparison to current seasonal influenza vaccines and CVVs. The Mia system rapidly identified three genetically distinct swine IAV lineages from three subtypes A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and A(H1N2). Additional analysis of the HA protein sequences of the A(H1N2) viruses identified &amp;gt;30 amino acid differences between the HA1 portion of the hemagglutinin of these viruses and the most closely related pre-2009 CVV. All virus sequences were emailed to colleagues at CDC who initiated development of a synthetically derived CVV designed to provide an optimal antigenic match with the viruses detected in the exhibition. In subsequent months, this virus caused 13 infections in humans, and was the dominant variant virus in the US detected in 2018. Had this virus caused a severe outbreak or pandemic, our proactive surveillance efforts and CVV derivation would have provided an approximate 8 week time advantage for vaccine manufacturing. This is the first report of the use of field-derived nanopore sequencing data to initiate a real-time, actionable public health countermeasure.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolutionary pathways to antibiotic resistance are dependent upon environmental structure and bacterial lifestyle, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractBacterial populations vary in their stress tolerance and population structure depending upon whether growth occurs in well-mixed or structured environments. We hypothesized that evolution in biofilms would generate greater genetic diversity than well-mixed environments and lead to different pathways of antibiotic resistance. We used experimental evolution and whole genome sequencing to test how the biofilm lifestyle influenced the rate, genetic mechanisms, and pleiotropic effects of resistance to ciprofloxacin in Acinetobacter baumannii populations. Both evolutionary dynamics and the identities of mutations differed between lifestyle. Planktonic populations experienced selective sweeps of mutations including the primary topoisomerase drug targets, whereas biofilm-adapted populations acquired mutations in regulators of efflux pumps. An overall trade-off between fitness and resistance level emerged, wherein biofilm-adapted clones were less resistant than planktonic but more fit in the absence of drug. However, biofilm populations developed collateral sensitivity to cephalosporins, demonstrating the clinical relevance of lifestyle on the evolution of resistance.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clades of huge phage from across Earth’s ecosystems, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11</h4>
          <p>Phage typically have small genomes and depend on their bacterial hosts for replication. DNA sequenced from many diverse ecosystems revealed hundreds of huge phage genomes, between 200 kbp and 716 kbp in length. Thirty-four genomes were manually curated to completion, including the largest phage genomes yet reported. Expanded genetic repertoires include diverse and new CRISPR-Cas systems, tRNAs, tRNA synthetases, tRNA modification enzymes, translation initiation and elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins. Phage CRISPR-Cas systems have the capacity to silence host transcription factors and translational genes, potentially as part of a larger interaction network that intercepts translation to redirect biosynthesis to phage-encoded functions. In addition, some phage may repurpose bacterial CRISPR-Cas systems to eliminate competing phage. We phylogenetically define major clades of huge phage from human and other animal microbiomes, oceans, lakes, sediments, soils and the built environment. We conclude that their large gene inventories reflect a conserved biological strategy, observed over a broad bacterial host range and across Earth’s ecosystems.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Noroviruses subvert the core stress granule component G3BP1 to promote viral VPg-dependent translation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractKnowledge of the host factors required for norovirus replication has been hindered by the challenges associated with culturing human noroviruses. We have combined proteomic analysis of the viral translation and replication complexes with a CRISPR screen, to identify host factors required for norovirus infection. The core stress granule component G3BP1 was identified as a host factor essential for efficient human and murine norovirus infection, demonstrating a conserved function across the Norovirus genus. Furthermore, we show that G3BP1 functions in the novel paradigm of viral VPg-dependent translation initiation, contributing to the assembly of translation complexes on the VPg-linked viral positive sense RNA genome by facilitating 40S recruitment. Our data suggest that G3BP1 functions by providing viral RNA a competitive advantage over capped cellular RNAs, uncovering a novel function for G3BP1 in the life cycle of positive sense RNA viruses and identifying the first host factor with pan-norovirus pro-viral activity.</p>
