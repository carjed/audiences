          <p>Background Profiling microbiome on low biomass samples is challenging for metagenomics since these samples are prone to present DNA from other sources, such as the host or the environment. The usual approach is sequencing specific hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, which fails to assign taxonomy to genus and species level. Here, we aim to assess long-amplicon PCR-based approaches for assigning taxonomy at the genus and species level. We use Nanopore sequencing with two different markers full-length 16S rRNA (~1,500 bp) and the whole rrn operon (16S rRNA gene - ITS - 23S rRNA gene; 4,500 bp).Methods We sequenced a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, two mock communities (HM-783D, Bei Resources; D6306, ZymoBIOMICS) and two pools of low-biomass samples (dog skin). Nanopore sequencing was performed on MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) using 1D PCR barcoding kit. Sequences were pre-processed, and data were analyzed using WIMP workflow on EPI2ME (ONT) or Minimap2 software with rrn database.Results Full-length 16S rRNA and the rrn operon retrieved the microbiota composition from the bacterial isolate, the mock communities and the complex skin samples, even at the genus and species level. For Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate, when using EPI2ME, the amplicons were assigned to the correct bacterial species in ~98% of the cases with rrn operon as the marker, and ~68% of the cases with 16S rRNA gene respectively. In both skin microbiota samples, we detected many species with an environmental origin. In chin, we found different Pseudomonas species in high abundance, whereas in the dorsal skin there were more taxa with lower abundances.Conclusions Both full-length 16S rRNA and the rrn operon retrieved the microbiota composition of simple and complex microbial communities, even from the low-biomass samples such as dog skin. For an increased resolution at the species level, rrn operon would be the best choice.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Origins and Evolution of the Global RNA Virome, bioRxiv, 2018-10-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractViruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (&#43;) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from &#43;RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of &#43;RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.IMPORTANCEThe majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than what was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore Classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Adding function to the genome of African Salmonella ST313, bioRxiv, 2018-10-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractSalmonella Typhimurium ST313 causes invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa, targeting susceptible HIV&#43;, malarial or malnourished individuals. An in-depth genomic comparison between the ST313 isolate D23580, and the well-characterized ST19 isolate 474 that causes gastroenteritis across the globe, revealed extensive synteny. To understand how the 856 nucleotide variations generated phenotypic differences, we devised a large-scale experimental approach that involved the global gene expression analysis of strains D23580 and 474 grown in sixteen infection-relevant growth conditions. Comparison of transcriptional patterns identified virulence and metabolic genes that were differentially expressed between D23580 versus 474, many of which were validated by proteomics. We also uncovered the S. Typhimurium D23580 and 474 genes that showed expression differences during infection of murine macrophages. Our comparative transcriptomic data are presented in a new enhanced version of the Salmonella expression compendium SalComD23580 &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpbioinf.gen.tcd.iecgi-binsalcom_v2.pl&gt;bioinf.gen.tcd.iecgi-binsalcom_v2.pl&lt;jatsext-link&gt;. We discovered that the ablation of melibiose utilization was caused by 3 independent SNP mutations in D23580 that are shared across ST313 lineage 2, suggesting that the ability to catabolise this carbon source has been negatively selected during ST313 evolution. The data revealed a novel plasmid maintenance system involving a plasmid-encoded CysS cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase, highlighting the power of large-scale comparative multi-condition analyses to pinpoint key phenotypic differences between bacterial pathovariants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A membrane-depolarising toxin substrate of the Staphylococcus aureus Type VII protein secretion system targets eukaryotes and bacteria, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryThe type VII protein secretion system (T7SS) is conserved across Staphylococcus aureus strains and plays important roles in virulence and interbacterial competition. To date only one T7SS substrate protein, encoded in a subset of strains, has been functionally characterized. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we identify TspA as a further T7SS substrate. TspA, encoded distantly from the T7SS gene cluster, is found across all S. aureus strains. Heterologous expression of TspA indicates that it has a toxic C-terminal domain that depolarizes membranes. The membrane depolarizing activity is alleviated by co-production of the TsaI immunity protein. Using a zebrafish hindbrain ventricle infection model, we demonstrate that the T7SS of strain RN6390 contributes to zebrafish mortality, and deletion of tspA leads to increased bacterial clearance in vivo. The toxin domain of TspA is highly polymorphic and S. aureus strains encode multiple tsaI homologues at the tspA locus, suggestive of additional roles in intra-species competition. In agreement, we demonstrate TspA-dependent growth inhibition of RN6390 by strain COL in the zebrafish infection model, that is alleviated by the presence of TsaI homologues. This is the first T7SS substrate protein shown to have activity against both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">In situ and high-resolution Cryo-EM structure of the Type VI secretion membrane complex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractBacteria have evolved macromolecular machineries that secrete effectors and toxins to survive and thrive in diverse environments. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile machine that is related to Myoviridae phages. The T6SS is composed of a baseplate that contains a spike onto which an inner tube is built, surrounded by a contractile sheath. Unlike phages that are released to and act in the extracellular medium, the T6SS is an intracellular machine inserted in the bacterial membranes by a trans-envelope complex. This membrane complex (MC) comprises three proteins TssJ, TssL and TssM. We previously reported the low-resolution negative stain electron microscopy structure of the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli MC and proposed a rotational 5-fold symmetry with a TssJTssLTssM stoichiometry of 222. Here, cryo-electron tomography analysis of the T6SS MC confirmed the 5-fold symmetry in situ and identified the regions of the structure that insert into the bacterial membranes. A high resolution model obtained by single particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals its global architecture and highlights new features five additional copies of TssJ, yielding a TssJTssLTssM stoichiometry of 322, a 11-residue loop in TssM, protruding inside the lumen of the MC and constituting a functionally important periplasmic gate, and hinge regions. Based on these data, we revisit the model on the mechanism of action of the MC during T6SS assembly and function.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell virus sequencing of influenza infections that trigger innate immunity, bioRxiv, 2018-10-07</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYThe outcome of viral infection is extremely heterogeneous, with infected cells only sometimes activating innate immunity. Here we develop a new approach to assess how the genetic variation inherent in viral populations contributes to this heterogeneity. We do this by determining both the transcriptome and full-length sequences of all viral genes in single influenza-infected cells. Most cells are infected by virions with defects such as amino-acid mutations, internal deletions, or failure to express a gene. We identify instances of each type of defect that increase the likelihood that a cell activates an innate-immune response. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects, and sometimes occurs even when a cell is infected by a virion that expresses unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that viral genetic variation substantially contributes to but does not fully explain the heterogeneity in single influenza-infected cells.</p>
