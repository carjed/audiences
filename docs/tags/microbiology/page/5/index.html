          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A single bacterial genus maintains root development in a complex microbiome, bioRxiv, 2019-05-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractPlants grow within a complex web of species interacting with each other and with the plant. Many of these interactions are governed by a wide repertoire of chemical signals, and the resulting chemical landscape of the rhizosphere can strongly affect root health and development. To understand how microbe-microbe interactions influence root development in Arabidopsis, we established a model system for plant-microbe-microbe-environment interactions. We inoculated seedlings with a 185-member bacterial synthetic community (SynCom), manipulated the abiotic environment, and measured bacterial colonization of the plant. This enabled classification of the SynCom into four modules of co-occurring strains. We deconstructed the SynCom based on these modules, identifying microbe-microbe interactions that determine root phenotypes. These interactions primarily involve a single bacterial genus, Variovorax, which completely reverts severe root growth inhibition (RGI) induced by a wide diversity of bacterial strains as well as by the entire 185-member community. We demonstrate that Variovorax manipulate plant hormone levels to balance this ecologically realistic root community’s effects on root development. We identify a novel auxin degradation operon in the Variovorax genome that is necessary and sufficient for RGI reversion. Therefore, metabolic signal interference shapes bacteria-plant communication networks and is essential for maintaining the root’s developmental program. Optimizing the feedbacks that shape chemical interaction networks in the rhizosphere provides a promising new ecological strategy towards the development of more resilient and productive crops.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Allelic polymorphism shapes community function in evolving Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations, bioRxiv, 2019-05-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) by forming antibiotic resistant biofilms. Emergence of phenotypically diverse isolates within CF P. aeruginosa populations has previously been reported, however, the impact of heterogeneity on social behaviors and community function is poorly understood. Here we describe how this heterogeneity impacts on behavioral traits by evolving the strain PAO1 in biofilms grown in a synthetic sputum medium for 50 days. We measured social trait production and antibiotic resistance, and used a metagenomic approach to analyze and assess genomic changes over the duration of the evolution experiment. We found that (i) evolutionary trajectories were reproducible in independently evolving populations; (ii) over 60% of genomic diversity occurred within the first 10 days of selection. We then focused on quorum sensing (QS), a well-studied P. aeruginosa trait that is commonly mutated in strains isolated from CF lungs. We found that at the population level (i) evolution in sputum medium selected for decreased production of QS and QS-dependent traits; (ii) there was a significant correlation between lasR mutant frequency, the loss of protease and the 3O-C12-HSL signal, and an increase in resistance to clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics, despite no previous antibiotic exposure. Overall, our findings provide insights into the impact of allelic polymorphism on community functions in diverse P. aeruginosa populations. Further, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa population and evolutionary dynamics can impact on traits important for virulence and can lead to increased tolerance to β-lactam antibiotics.SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of chronic infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others in the lung and become phenotypically and genotypically diverse over time. How this heterogeneity impacts on clinically relevant traits such as virulence or antibiotic resistance has received little attention. Here we demonstrate that the accumulation of genetic variants within heterogenous P. aeruginosa populations, results in population level changes in important traits including quorum sensing and antimicrobial resistance. Our work suggests that in the future, we should consider metagenomic and metaphenotypic assessments of P. aeruginosa populations collected from CF patients, rather than focusing on single random colonies isolated from infection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Next-generation sequencing of double stranded RNA is greatly improved by treatment with the inexpensive denaturing reagent DMSO, bioRxiv, 2019-05-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractDouble stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the genetic material of important viruses and a key component of RNA interference-based immunity in eukaryotes. Previous studies have noted difficulties in determining the sequence of dsRNA molecules that have affected studies of immune function and estimates of viral diversity in nature. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been used to denature dsRNA prior to the reverse transcription stage to improve RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. We systematically tested the utility of DMSO to improve sequencing yield of a dsRNA virus (Φ6) in a short-read next generation sequencing platform. DMSO treatment improved sequencing read recovery by over two orders of magnitude, even when RNA and cDNA concentrations were below the limit of detection. We also tested the effects of DMSO on a mock eukaryotic viral community and found that dsRNA virus reads increased with DMSO treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DMSO treatment does not adversely affect recovery of reads from a single-stranded RNA viral genome (Influenza ACalifornia072009). We suggest that up to 50% DMSO treatment be used prior to cDNA synthesis when samples of interest are composed of or may contain dsRNA.Data SummarySequence data was deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession numbers PRJNA527100, PRJNA527101, PRJNA527098).

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rare microbes from diverse Earth biomes dominate community activity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractMicrobes are the Earth’s most numerous organisms and are instrumental in driving major global biological and chemical processes. Microbial activity is a crucial component of all ecosystems, as microbes have the potential to control any major biochemical process. In recent years, considerable strides have been made in describing the community structure, i.e. diversity and abundance, of microbes from the Earth’s major biomes. In virtually all environments studied, a few highly abundant taxa dominate the structure of microbial communities. Still, microbial diversity is high and is concentrated in the less abundant, or rare, fractions of the community, i.e. the “long tail” of the abundance distribution. The relationship between microbial community structure and activity, specifically the role of rare microbes, and its connection to ecosystem function, is not fully understood. We analyzed 12.3 million metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence assemblies and their genes from environmental, human, and engineered microbiomes, and show that microbial activity is dominated by rare microbes (96% of total activity) across all measured biomes. Further, rare microbial activity was comprised of traits that are fundamental to ecosystem and organismal health, e.g. biogeochemical cycling and infectious disease. The activity of rare microbes was also tightly coupled to temperature, revealing a link between basic biological processes, e.g. reaction rates, and community activity. Our study provides a broadly applicable and predictable paradigm that implicates rare microbes as the main microbial drivers of ecosystem function and organismal health.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A megaplasmid family responsible for dissemination of multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas, bioRxiv, 2019-05-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractMultidrug resistance (MDR) represents a global threat to health. Although plasmids can play an important role in the dissemination of MDR, they have not been commonly linked to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We used whole genome sequencing to characterize a collection of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from a hospital in Thailand. Using long-read sequence data we obtained complete sequences of two closely related megaplasmids (&amp;gt;420 kb) carrying large arrays of antibiotic resistance genes located in discrete, complex and dynamic resistance regions, and revealing evidence of extensive duplication and recombination events. A comprehensive pangenomic and phylogenomic analysis indicated that 1) these large plasmids comprise a family present in different members of the Pseudomonas genus and associated with multiple sources (geographical, clinical or environmental); 2) the megaplasmids encode diverse niche-adaptive accessory traits, including multidrug resistance; 3) the pangenome of the megaplasmid family is highly flexible and diverse, comprising a substantial core genome (average of 48% of plasmid genes), but with individual members carrying large numbers of unique genes. The history of the megaplasmid family, inferred from our analysis of the available database, suggests that members carrying multiple resistance genes date back to at least the 1970s.FundingThis work was supported by the International Pseudomonas Genomics Consortium, funded by Cystic Fibrosis Canada [RCL]; and the Secretaría de Educación, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (SECTEI), Mexico [AC].</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Long metabarcoding of the eukaryotic rDNA operon to phylogenetically and taxonomically resolve environmental diversity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractHigh-throughput environmental DNA metabarcoding has revolutionized the analysis of microbial diversity, but this approach is generally restricted to amplicon sizes below 500 base pairs. These short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. However, new long-read sequencing technologies such as the Pacific Biosciences platform may provide sufficiently large sequence lengths to overcome the poor phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain a ~4500 bp region of the eukaryotic rDNA operon spanning most of the small (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA genes. The CCS reads were first treated with a novel curation workflow that generated 650 high-quality OTUs containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions of the long amplicons. In order to assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based and phylogenetic placement-based methods using shorter reads. The taxonomically-annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58%) corresponded to the new long environmental CCS reads. Comparisons to the 18S-only region of our amplicons revealed that the combined 18S-28S genes globally increased the phylogenetic resolution, recovering specific groupings otherwise missing. The long-reads also allowed to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Altogether, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.</p>
