          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An RNA-binding region regulates CTCF clustering and chromatin looping, bioRxiv, 2018-12-13</h4>
          <p>Mammalian genomes are folded into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), consisting of cell-type specific chromatin loops anchored by CTCF and cohesin. Since CTCF and cohesin are expressed ubiquitously, how cell-type specific CTCF-mediated loops are formed poses a paradox. Here we show RNase-sensitive CTCF self-association in vitro and that an RNA-binding region (RBR) mediates CTCF clustering in vivo. Intriguingly, deleting the RBR abolishes or impairs almost half of all chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells. Disrupted loop formation correlates with abrogated clustering and diminished chromatin binding of the RBR mutant CTCF protein, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least 2 classes RBR-independent and RBR-dependent loops. We suggest that evidence for distinct classes of RBR-dependent loops may provide a mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops regulated by RNAs and other RBR partner.</p>

          <p>AbstractInferences derived from large multiple alignments of biological sequences are critical to many areas of biology, including evolution, genomics, biochemistry, and structural biology. However, the complexity of the alignment problem imposes the use of approximate solutions. The most common is the progressive algorithm, which starts by aligning the most similar sequences, incorporating the remaining ones following the order imposed by a guide-tree. We developed and validated on protein sequences a regressive algorithm that works the other way around, aligning first the most dissimilar sequences. Our algorithm produces more accurate alignments than non-regressive methods, especially on datasets larger than 10,000 sequences. By design, it can run any existing alignment method in linear time thus allowing the scale-up required for extremely large genomic analyses.One Sentence SummaryInitiating alignments with the most dissimilar sequences allows slow and accurate methods to be used on large datasets</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale exome sequencing study implicates both developmental and functional changes in the neurobiology of autism, bioRxiv, 2018-12-01</h4>
          <p>SummaryWe present the largest exome sequencing study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to date (n=35,584 total samples, 11,986 with ASD). Using an enhanced Bayesian framework to integrate de novo and case-control rare variation, we identify 102 risk genes at a false discovery rate ≤ 0.1. Of these genes, 49 show higher frequencies of disruptive de novo variants in individuals ascertained for severe neurodevelopmental delay, while 53 show higher frequencies in individuals ascertained for ASD; comparing ASD cases with mutations in these groups reveals phenotypic differences. Expressed early in brain development, most of the risk genes have roles in regulation of gene expression or neuronal communication (i.e., mutations effect neurodevelopmental and neurophysiological changes), and 13 fall within loci recurrently hit by copy number variants. In human cortex single-cell gene expression data, expression of risk genes is enriched in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple paths to an excitatoryinhibitory imbalance underlying ASD.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Intelligible speech synthesis from neural decoding of spoken sentences, bioRxiv, 2018-11-30</h4>
          <p>The ability to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity has significant practical and scientific implications. For example, technology that translates cortical activity into speech would be transformative for people unable to communicate as a result of neurological impairment. Decoding speech from neural activity is challenging because speaking requires extremely precise and dynamic control of multiple vocal tract articulators on the order of milliseconds. Here, we designed a neural decoder that explicitly leverages the continuous kinematic and sound representations encoded in cortical activity to generate fluent and intelligible speech. A recurrent neural network first decoded vocal tract physiological signals from direct cortical recordings, and then transformed them to acoustic speech output. Robust decoding performance was achieved with as little as 25 minutes of training data. Naive listeners were able to accurately identify these decoded sentences. Additionally, speech decoding was not only effective for audibly produced speech, but also when participants silently mimed speech. These results advance the development of speech neuroprosthetic technology to restore spoken communication in patients with disabling neurological disorders.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sex differences in gene expression in the human fetal brain, bioRxiv, 2018-11-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWidespread structural, chemical and molecular differences have been reported between the male and female human brain. Although several neurodevelopmental disorders are more commonly diagnosed in males, little is known regarding sex differences in early human brain development. Here, we used RNA sequencing data from a large collection of human brain samples from the second trimester of gestation (N = 120) to assess sex biases in gene expression within the human fetal brain. In addition to 43 genes (102 Ensembl transcripts) transcribed from the Y-chromosome in males, we detected sex differences in the expression of 2558 autosomal genes (2723 Ensembl transcripts) and 155 genes on the X-chromosome (207 Ensembl transcripts) at a false discovery rate (FDR) &amp;lt; 0.1. Genes exhibiting sex-biased expression in human fetal brain are enriched for high-confidence risk genes for autism and other developmental disorders. Male-biased genes are enriched for expression in neural progenitor cells, whereas female-biased genes are enriched for expression in Cajal-Retzius cells and glia. All gene- and transcript-level data are provided as an online resource (available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpfgen.psycm.cf.ac.ukFBSeq1&gt;httpfgen.psycm.cf.ac.ukFBSeq1&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) through which researchers can search, download and visualize data pertaining to sex biases in gene expression during early human brain development.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Carbs versus fat does it really matter for maintaining lost weight?, bioRxiv, 2018-11-28</h4>
          <p>The most read article of 2018 published in The BMJ (httpsdoi.org10.1136bmj.k4583) claimed that restricting dietary carbohydrates offers a metabolic advantage to burn more calories and thereby help patients maintain lost weight. However, analyzing the data according to the original pre-registered statistical plan resulted in no statistically significant effects of diet composition on energy expenditure. The large reported diet effects on energy expenditure calculated using the revised analysis plan depended on data from subjects with excessive amounts of unaccounted energy. Adjusting the data to be commensurate with energy conservation resulted in a diet effect that was less than half the value reported in The BMJ paper. Furthermore, the measured daily average CO2 production rates were not significantly different between the diets and the reported expenditure differences were due to inaccurate calculations based on false assumptions about diet adherence.</p>
