          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reduced signal for polygenic adaptation of height in UK Biobank, bioRxiv, 2018-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractSeveral recent papers have reported strong signals of selection on European polygenic height scores. These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect-size estimates for height are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single cell RNA-seq denoising using a deep count autoencoder, bioRxiv, 2018-04-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at a cellular resolution. However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNAseq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Recovering signals of ghost archaic admixture in the genomes of present-day Africans, bioRxiv, 2018-03-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractAnalyses of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes have characterized multiple interbreeding events between archaic and modern human populations. While several studies have suggested the presence of deeply diverged lineages in present-day African populations, we lack methods to precisely characterize these introgression events without access to reference archaic genomes. We present a novel reference-free method that combines diverse population genetic summary statistics to identify segments of archaic ancestry in present-day individuals. Using this method, we find that 7.97 ±0.6% of the genetic ancestry from the West African Yoruba population traces its origin to an unidentified, archaic population (FDR ≤20%). We find several loci that harbor archaic ancestry at elevated frequencies and that the archaic ancestry in the Yoruba is reduced near selectively constrained regions of the genome suggesting that archaic admixture has had a systematic impact on the fitness of modern human populations both within and outside of Africa.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exploring the Impact of Analysis Software on Task fMRI Results, bioRxiv, 2018-03-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractA wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this ‘methodological plurality’ comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software packages, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. Neuroimaging is currently experiencing a surge in initiatives to improve research practices and ensure that all conclusions inferred from an fMRI study are replicable.In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publically shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyze, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 - 0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our own efforts to make this research reproducible.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Widespread transcriptional scanning in the testis modulates gene evolution rates, bioRxiv, 2018-03-14</h4>
          <p>The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Analyzing our single-cell transcriptomic maps of human and mouse spermatogenesis, we provide evidence that this widespread transcription serves to maintain DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through &#39;transcriptional scanning&#39;. Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary time-scales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning modulates germline mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for fast evolution in a specific subset.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Intellectual Synthesis in Mentorship Determines Success in Academic Careers, bioRxiv, 2018-03-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractAs academic careers become more competitive, junior scientists need to understand the value that mentorship brings to their success in academia. Previous research has found that, unsurprisingly, successful mentors tend to train successful students. But what characteristics of this relationship predict success, and how? We analyzed an open-access database of about 20,000 researchers who have undergone both graduate and postdoctoral training, compiled across several fields of biomedical science. Our results show that postdoctoral mentors were more instrumental to trainees’ success compared to graduate mentors. A trainee’s success in academia was predicted by the degree of intellectual synthesis with their mentors, resulting from fusing the influence of disparate advisors. This suggests that junior scientists should have increased chances of success by training with and linking the ideas of mentors from different fields. We discuss the implications of these results for choosing mentors and determining the duration of postdoctoral training.</p>
