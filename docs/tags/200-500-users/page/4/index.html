          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Species-specific oscillation periods of human and mouse segmentation clocks are due to cell autonomous differences in biochemical reaction parameters, bioRxiv, 2019-05-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractWhile the mechanisms of embryonic development are similar between mouse and human, the tempo is in general slower in human. The cause of interspecies differences in developmental time remains a mystery partly due to lack of an appropriate model system1. Since murine and human embryos differ in their sizes, geometries, and nutrients, we use in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to compare the same type of cells between the species in similar culture conditions. As an example of well-defined developmental time, we focus on the segmentation clock, oscillatory gene expression that regulates the timing of sequential formation of body segments2–4. In this way we recapitulate the murine and human segmentation clocks in vitro, showing that the species-specific oscillation periods are derived from cell autonomous differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions. Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)-like cells induced from murine and human PSCs displayed the oscillatory expression of HES7, the core gene of the segmentation clock5,6, with oscillation periods of 2-3 hours (mouse PSM) and 5-6 hours (human PSM). Swapping HES7 loci between murine and human genomes did not change the oscillation periods dramatically, denying the possibility that interspecies differences in the sequences of HES7 loci might be the cause of the observed period difference. Instead, we found that the biochemical reactions that determine the oscillation period, such as the degradation of HES7 and delays in its expression, are slower in human PSM compared with those in mouse PSM. With the measured biochemical parameters, our mathematical model successfully accounted for the 2-3-fold period difference between mouse and human. We further demonstrate that the concept of slower biochemical reactions in human cells is generalizable to several other genes, as well as to another cell type. These results collectively indicate that differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions between murine and human cells give rise to the interspecies period difference of the segmentation clock and may contribute to other interspecies differences in developmental time.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A rationally designed and highly versatile epitope tag for nanobody-based purification, detection and manipulation of proteins, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecialized epitope tags are widely used for detecting, manipulating or purifying proteins, but often their versatility is limited. Here, we introduce the ALFA-tag, a novel, rationally designed epitope tag that serves an exceptionally broad spectrum of applications in life sciences while outperforming established tags like the HA, FLAG or myc tags. The ALFA-tag forms a small and stable α-helix that is functional irrespective of its position on the target protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. We developed a nanobody (NbALFA) binding ALFA-tagged proteins from native or fixed specimen with low picomolar affinity. It is ideally suited for super-resolution microscopy, immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, and also allows in-vivo detection of proteins. By solving the crystal structure of the complex we were able to design a nanobody mutant (NbALFAPE) that permits efficient one-step purifications of native ALFA-tagged proteins, complexes and even entire living cells using peptide elution under physiological conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Precise tuning of cortical contractility regulates cell shape during cytokinesis, bioRxiv, 2019-05-13</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe mechanical properties of the cellular cortex regulate shape changes during cell division, cell migration and tissue morphogenesis. During cell division, contractile force generated by the molecular motor myosin II (MII) at the equatorial cortex drives cleavage furrow ingression. Cleavage furrow ingression in turn increases stresses at the polar cortex, where contractility must be regulated to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis. How polar cortex contractility controls cell shape is poorly understood. We show a balance between MII paralogs allows a fine-tuning of cortex tension at the polar cortex to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis, with MIIA driving cleavage furrow ingression and bleb formation, and MIIB serving as a stabilizing motor and mediating completion of cytokinesis. As the majority of non-muscle contractile systems are cortical, this tuning mechanism will likely be applicable to numerous processes driven by MII contractility.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ultrastructure of the axonal periodic scaffold reveals a braid-like organization of actin rings, bioRxiv, 2019-05-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent super-resolution microscopy studies have unveiled a periodic scaffold of actin rings regularly spaced by spectrins under the plasma membrane of axons. However, ultrastructural details are unknown, limiting a molecular and mechanistic understanding of these enigmatic structures. Here, we combine platinum-replica electron and optical super-resolution micros-copy to investigate the cortical cytoskeleton of axons at the ultrastructural level. We resolve actin rings as braids made of two long, intertwined actin filaments connected by a dense mesh of aligned spectrins. This molecular arrangement contrasts with the currently assumed model of actin rings made of short, capped actin filaments. We propose that braided rings explain the stability of the actin-spectrin scaffold and ultimately help preserving the axon integrity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A comparison of eDNA to camera trapping for assessment of terrestrial mammal diversity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) is one of the most promising approaches to meet the demand for the fast and frequent monitoring of ecosystems needed to tackle the current decline in biodiversity. However, before eDNA can establish itself as a robust alternative for mammal monitoring, comparison with existing approaches is necessary, yet has not been done. Moreover, much is unknown regarding the nature, spread and persistence of DNA shed by animals into terrestrial environments, or the optimal experimental design for understanding these potential biases.To address some of these challenges, we compared the detection of terrestrial mammals using eDNA analysis of soil samples against confirmed species observations from a long-term (∼9-yr) camera trapping study. At the same time, we considered multiple experimental parameters, including two sampling designs, two DNA extraction kits and two metabarcodes of different sizes.All mammals consistently recorded with cameras were detected in eDNA. In addition, eDNA reported many small mammals not recorded by camera traps, but whose presence in the study area is otherwise documented. A long metabarcode (≈220bp) offering a high taxonomic resolution, achieved a similar efficiency as a shorter one (≈70bp) and a phosphate buffer-based extraction gave similar results as a total DNA extraction method for a fraction of the price. Our results support that eDNA-based monitoring should become a valuable part of terrestrial mammal surveys. Yet, the lack of coverage of mammal mitochondrial genomes in public databases must be addressed before eDNA can be used to its full potential.</p>
