          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Polygenic Adaptation has Impacted Multiple Anthropometric Traits, bioRxiv, 2017-07-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractOur understanding of the genetic basis of human adaptation is biased toward loci of large pheno-typic effect. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) now enable the study of genetic adaptation in polygenic phenotypes. We test for polygenic adaptation among 187 world-wide human populations using polygenic scores constructed from GWAS of 34 complex traits. We identify signals of polygenic adaptation for anthropometric traits including height, infant head circumference (IHC), hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Analysis of ancient DNA samples indicates that a north-south cline of height within Europe and and a west-east cline across Eurasia can be traced to selection for increased height in two late Pleistocene hunter gatherer populations living in western and west-central Eurasia. Our observation that IHC and WHR follow a latitudinal cline in Western Eurasia support the role of natural selection driving Bergmann’s Rule in humans, consistent with thermoregulatory adaptation in response to latitudinal temperature variation.Author’s Note on Failure to ReplicateAfter this preprint was posted, the UK Biobank dataset was released, providing a new and open GWAS resource. When attempting to replicate the height selection results from this preprint using GWAS data from the UK Biobank, we discovered that we could not. In subsequent analyses, we determined that both the GIANT consortium height GWAS data, as well as another dataset that was used for replication, were impacted by stratification issues that created or at a minimum substantially inflated the height selection signals reported here. The results of this second investigation, written together with additional coauthors, have now been published (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpselifesciences.orgarticles39725&gt;httpselifesciences.orgarticles39725&lt;jatsext-link&gt; along with another paper by a separate group of authors, showing similar issues &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpselifesciences.orgarticles39702&gt;httpselifesciences.orgarticles39702&lt;jatsext-link&gt;). A preliminary investigation shows that the other non-height based results may suffer from similar issues. We stand by the theory and statistical methods reported in this paper, and the paper can be cited for these results. However, we have shown that the data on which the major empirical results were based are not sound, and so should be treated with caution until replicated.</p>

          <p>To increase our understanding of cells, there is a need for specific markers to identify biomolecules, cellular structures and compartments. One type of markers comprises genetically encoded fluorescent probes that are linked with protein domains, peptides andor signal sequences. These markers are encoded on a plasmid and they allow straightforward, convenient labeling of cultured mammalian cells by introducing the plasmid into the cells. Ideally, the fluorescent marker combines favorable spectroscopic properties (brightness, photostability) with specific labeling of the structure or compartment of interest. Here, we report on our ongoing efforts to generate robust and bright genetically encoded fluorescent markers for highlighting structures and compartments in living cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Environmental factors dominate over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota composition, bioRxiv, 2017-06-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHuman gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High contiguity Arabidopsis thaliana genome assembly with a single nanopore flow cell, bioRxiv, 2017-06-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractWhile many evolutionary questions can be answered by short read re-sequencing, presenceabsence polymorphisms of genes andor transposons have been largely ignored in large-scale intraspecific evolutionary studies. To enable the rigorous analysis of such variants, multiple high quality and contiguous genome assemblies are essential. Similarly, while genome assemblies based on short reads have made genomics accessible for non-reference species, these assemblies have limitations due to low contiguity. Long-read sequencers and long-read technologies have ushered in a new era of genome sequencing where the lengths of reads exceed those of most repeats. However, because these technologies are not only costly, but also time and compute intensive, it has been unclear how scalable they are. Here we demonstrate a fast and cost effective reference assembly for an Arabidopsis thaliana accession using the USB-sized Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer and typical consumer computing hardware (4 Cores, 16Gb RAM). We assemble the accession KBS-Mac-74 into 62 contigs with an N50 length of 12.3 Mb covering 100% (119 Mb) of the non-repetitive genome. We demonstrate that the polished KBS-Mac-74 assembly is highly contiguous with BioNano optical genome maps, and of high per-base quality against a likewise polished Pacific Biosciences long-read assembly. The approach we implemented took a total of four days at a cost of less than 1,000 USD for sequencing consumables including instrument depreciation.</p>

          <p>Because plants do not possess a proper germline, deleterious somatic mutations can be passed to gametes and a large number of cell divisions separating zygote from gamete formation in long-lived plants may lead to many mutations. We sequenced the genome of two terminal branches of a 234-year-old oak tree and found few fixed somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), whose sequential appearance in the tree could be traced along nested sectors of younger branches. Our data suggest that stem cells of shoot meristems are robustly protected from accumulation of mutations in trees.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ancient genomes from southern Africa pushes modern human divergence beyond 260,000 years ago, bioRxiv, 2017-06-06</h4>
          <p>Southern Africa is consistently placed as one of the potential regions for the evolution of          Homo sapiens          . To examine the region&#39;s human prehistory prior to the arrival of migrants from East and West Africa or Eurasia in the last 1,700 years, we generated and analyzed genome sequence data from seven ancient individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Three Stone Age hunter-gatherers date to ~2,000 years ago, and we show that they were related to current-day southern San groups such as the Karretjie People. Four Iron Age farmers (300-500 years old) have genetic signatures similar to present day Bantu-speakers. The genome sequence (13x coverage) of a juvenile boy from Ballito Bay, who lived ~2,000 years ago, demonstrates that southern African Stone Age hunter-gatherers were not impacted by recent admixture; however, we estimate that all modern-day Khoekhoe and San groups have been influenced by 9-22% genetic admixture from East AfricanEurasian pastoralist groups arriving &amp;gt;1,000 years ago, including the Ju|&#39;hoansi San, previously thought to have very low levels of admixture. Using traditional and new approaches, we estimate the population divergence time between the Ballito Bay boy and other groups to beyond 260,000 years ago. These estimates dramatically increases the deepest divergence amongst modern humans, coincide with the onset of the Middle Stone Age in sub-Saharan Africa, and coincide with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans as represented in the local fossil record. Cumulatively, cross-disciplinary records increasingly point to southern Africa as a potential (not necessarily exclusive) &#39;hot spot&#39; for the evolution of our species.</p>
