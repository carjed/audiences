          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">H3K4me3 is neither instructive for, nor informed by, transcription, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractH3K4me3 is a near-universal histone modification found predominantly at the 5’ region of genes, with a well-documented association with gene activity. H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over. Constitutive genes are generally well-expressed, which may alone explain the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression, while the biological role of H3K4me3 may have more to do with this distinction in gene class.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">ORANGE A CRISPRCas9-based genome editing toolbox for epitope tagging of endogenous proteins in neurons, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe correct subcellular distribution of protein complexes establishes the complex morphology of neurons and is fundamental to their functioning. Thus, determining the dynamic distribution of proteins is essential to understand neuronal processes. Fluorescence imaging, in particular super-resolution microscopy, has become invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution. However, these approaches suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins. We developed ORANGE an Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, that mediates targeted genomic integration of fluorescent tags in neurons. This toolbox includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, and a detailed protocol explaining how knock-in can be developed for novel targets. In combination with super-resolution microscopy, ORANGE revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neuronal signaling molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, ORANGE enables quantitation of expression and distribution for virtually any protein in neurons at high resolution and will significantly further our understanding of neuronal cell biology.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population genomics of the Viking world, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe Viking maritime expansion from Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, and Sweden) marks one of the swiftest and most far-flung cultural transformations in global history. During this time (c. 750 to 1050 CE), the Vikings reached most of western Eurasia, Greenland, and North America, and left a cultural legacy that persists till today. To understand the genetic structure and influence of the Viking expansion, we sequenced the genomes of 442 ancient humans from across Europe and Greenland ranging from the Bronze Age (c. 2400 BC) to the early Modern period (c. 1600 CE), with particular emphasis on the Viking Age. We find that the period preceding the Viking Age was accompanied by foreign gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east spreading from Denmark and eastern Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia. Despite the close linguistic similarities of modern Scandinavian languages, we observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, suggesting that regional population differences were already present 1,000 years ago. We find evidence for a majority of Danish Viking presence in England, Swedish Viking presence in the Baltic, and Norwegian Viking presence in Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial foreign European ancestry entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. We also find that several of the members of the only archaeologically well-attested Viking expedition were close family members. By comparing Viking Scandinavian genomes with present-day Scandinavian genomes, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the last millennia. Finally, we are able to trace the allele frequency dynamics of positively selected loci with unprecedented detail, including the lactase persistence allele and various alleles associated with the immune response. We conclude that the Viking diaspora was characterized by substantial foreign engagement distinct Viking populations influenced the genomic makeup of different regions of Europe, while Scandinavia also experienced increased contact with the rest of the continent.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Releasing a preprint is associated with more attention and citations for the peer-reviewed article, bioRxiv, 2019-07-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractPreprints in biology are gaining popularity, but release of a preprint still precedes only a fraction of peer-reviewed publications. We examined whether having a preprint on bioRxiv was associated with metrics of the corresponding peer-reviewed article. We assembled a dataset of 74,239 articles, 5,405 of which had a preprint, published in 39 journals. Based on log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, articles with a preprint had a 51% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 37% more citations compared to articles without one. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (e.g., scientific subfield and last author publication age) and unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor. This observational study can help researchers and publishers make informed decisions about how to incorporate preprints into their work.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cross-kingdom recognition of bacterial small RNAs induces transgenerational pathogenic avoidance, bioRxiv, 2019-07-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe recently discovered that C. elegans can pass on a learned avoidance of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) to four generations of its progeny. This transgenerational inheritance is bacterial species-specific, but how C. elegans recognizes and distinguishes different bacteria and transmits this information to future generations is not apparent. Here we show that small RNAs purified from pathogenic PA14 are sufficient not only to induce avoidance of pathogens in mothers, but also to confer transgenerational inheritance of this species-specific behavior for four generations, all without direct contact with pathogenic bacteria. This behavior requires the small RNA transporters SID-1 and SID-2, RNA interference pathway components, the piRNA PiwiArgonaute pathway, a functioning germline, and TGF-β ligand daf-7 expression in the ASI sensory neuron. Our results suggest that C. elegans “reads” small RNAs expressed by pathogenic bacteria, and uses this information to induce an escape behavior that lasts for four additional generations. C. elegans may have evolved this trans-kingdom signaling system to avoid pathogens in abundant classes of bacteria in its environment and its microbiome.</p>
