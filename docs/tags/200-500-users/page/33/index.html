          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Maternal gut and breast milk microbiota affect infant gut antibiotic resistome and mobile genetic elements, Nature Communications, 2018-09-18</h4>
          <p>The infant gut microbiota has a high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) compared to adults, even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Here we study potential sources of infant gut ARGs by performing metagenomic sequencing of breast milk, as well as infant and maternal gut microbiomes. We find that fecal ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles of infants are more similar to those of their own mothers than to those of unrelated mothers. MGEs in mothers’ breast milk are also shared with their own infants. Termination of breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers, which have the potential to affect microbial community composition, are associated with higher abundances of specific ARGs, the composition of which is largely shaped by bacterial phylogeny in the infant gut. Our results suggest that infants inherit the legacy of past antibiotic consumption of their mothers via transmission of genes, but microbiota composition still strongly impacts the overall resistance load.</p>

          <p>High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A comprehensive analysis of RNA sequences reveals macroscopic somatic clonal expansion across normal tissues, bioRxiv, 2018-09-14</h4>
          <p>Cancer genome studies have significantly advanced our knowledge of somatic mutations. However, how these mutations accumulate in normal cells and whether they promote pre-cancerous lesions remains poorly understood. Here we perform a comprehensive analysis of normal tissues by utilizing RNA sequencing data from ~6,700 samples across 29 normal tissues collected as part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We identify somatic mutations using a newly developed pipeline, RNA-MuTect, for calling somatic mutations directly from RNA-seq samples and their matched-normal DNA. When applied to the GTEx dataset, we detect multiple variants across different tissues and find that mutation burden is associated with both the age of the individual and tissue proliferation rate. We also detect hotspot cancer mutations that share tissue specificity with their matched cancer type. This study is the first to analyze a large number of samples across multiple normal tissues, identifying clones with genomic aberrations observed in cancer.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Predicting mRNA abundance directly from genomic sequence using deep convolutional neural networks, bioRxiv, 2018-09-14</h4>
          <p>Algorithms that accurately predict gene structure from primary sequence alone were transformative for annotating the human genome. Can we also predict the expression levels of genes based solely on genome sequence? Here we sought to apply deep convolutional neural networks towards this goal. Surprisingly, a model that includes only promoter sequences and features associated with mRNA stability explains 59% and 71% of variation in steady-state mRNA levels in human and mouse, respectively. This model, which we call Xpresso, more than doubles the accuracy of alternative sequence-based models, and isolates rules as predictive as models relying on ChIP-seq data. Xpresso recapitulates genome-wide patterns of transcriptional activity and predicts the influence of enhancers, heterochromatic domains, and microRNAs. Model interpretation reveals that promoter-proximal CpG dinucleotides strongly predict transcriptional activity. Looking forward, we propose the accurate prediction of cell type-specific gene expression based solely on primary sequence as a grand challenge for the field.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bio-On-Magnetic-Beads (BOMB) Open platform for high-throughput nucleic acid extraction and manipulation, bioRxiv, 2018-09-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractCurrent molecular biology laboratories rely heavily on the purification and manipulation of nucleic acids. Yet, commonly used centrifuge-and column-based protocols require specialised equipment, often use toxic reagents and are not economically scalable or practical to use in a high-throughput manner. Although it has been known for some time that magnetic beads can provide an elegant answer to these issues, the development of open-source protocols based on beads has been limited. In this article, we provide step-by-step instructions for an easy synthesis of functionalised magnetic beads, and detailed protocols for their use in the high-throughput purification of plasmids, genomic DNA and total RNA from different sources, as well as environmental TNA and PCR amplicons. We also provide a bead-based protocol for bisulfite conversion, and size selection of DNA and RNA fragments. Comparison to other methods highlights the capability, versatility and extreme cost-effectiveness of using magnetic beads. These open source protocols and the associated webpage (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsbomb.bio&gt;httpsbomb.bio&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) can serve as a platform for further protocol customisation and community engagement.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Brain-Score Which Artificial Neural Network for Object Recognition is most Brain-Like?, bioRxiv, 2018-09-05</h4>
          <p>The internal representations of early deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) were found to be remarkably similar to the internal neural representations measured experimentally in the primate brain. Here we ask, as deep ANNs have continued to evolve, are they becoming more or less brain-like? ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed Brain-Score – a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brain’s mechanisms for core object recognition – and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. (2) There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at ≥ 70% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brain’s network and thus drive next experiments. To facilitate both of these, we release &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpBrain-Score.org&gt;Brain-Score.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt; a platform that hosts the neural and behavioral benchmarks, where ANNs for visual processing can be submitted to receive a Brain-Score and their rank relative to other models, and where new experimental data can be naturally incorporated.</p>
