          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">immuneSIM tunable multi-feature simulation of B- and T-cell receptor repertoires for immunoinformatics benchmarking, bioRxiv, 2019-09-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractSummaryB- and T-cell receptor repertoires of the adaptive immune system have become a key target for diagnostics and therapeutics research. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing number of bioinformatics tools for immune repertoire analysis. Benchmarking of such tools is crucial for ensuring reproducible and generalizable computational analyses. Currently, however, it remains challenging to create standardized ground truth immune receptor repertoires for immunoinformatics tool benchmarking. Therefore, we developed immuneSIM, an R package that allows the simulation of native-like and aberrant synthetic full length variable region immune receptor sequences. ImmuneSIM enables the tuning of the immune receptor features (i) species and chain type (BCR, TCR, single, paired), (ii) germline gene usage, (iii) occurrence of insertions and deletions, (iv) clonal abundance, (v) somatic hypermutation, and (vi) sequence motifs. Each simulated sequence is annotated by the complete set of simulation events that contributed to its in silico generation. immuneSIM permits the benchmarking of key computational tools for immune receptor analysis such as germline gene annotation, diversity and overlap estimation, sequence similarity, network architecture, clustering analysis, and machine learning methods for motif detection.AvailabilityThe package is available via &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comGreiffLabimmuneSIM&gt;httpsgithub.comGreiffLabimmuneSIM&lt;jatsext-link&gt; and will also be available at CRAN (submitted).

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep learning for brains? Different linear and nonlinear scaling in UK Biobank brain images vs. machine-learning datasets, bioRxiv, 2019-09-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn recent years, deep learning has unlocked unprecedented success in various domains, especially in image, text, and speech processing. These breakthroughs may hold promise for neuroscience and especially for brain-imaging investigators who start to analyze thousands of participants. However, deep learning is only beneficial if the data have nonlinear relationships and if they are exploitable at currently available sample sizes. We systematically profiled the performance of deep models, kernel models, and linear models as a function of sample size on UK Biobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improved when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improved when switching to deep-nonlinear models. The more observations were available for model training, the greater the performance gain we saw. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models performed on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in agesex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In fact, linear models kept improving as the sample size approached ∼10,000 participants. Our results indicate that the increase in performance of linear models with additional data does not saturate at the limit of current feasibility. Yet, nonlinearities of common brain scans remain largely inaccessible to both kernel and deep learning methods at any examined scale.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Profiling cellular diversity in sponges informs animal cell type and nervous system evolution, bioRxiv, 2019-09-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe evolutionary origin of metazoan cell types such as neurons, muscles, digestive, and immune cells, remains unsolved. Using whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing in a sponge, an animal without nervous system and musculature, we identify 18 distinct cell types comprising four major families. This includes nitric-oxide sensitive contractile cells, digestive cells active in macropinocytosis, and a family of amoeboid-neuroid cells involved in innate immunity. We uncover ‘presynaptic’ genes in an amoeboid-neuroid cell type, and ‘postsynaptic’ genes in digestive choanocytes, suggesting asymmetric and targeted communication. Corroborating this, long neurite-like extensions from neuroid cells directly contact and enwrap choanocyte microvillar collars. Our data indicate a link between neuroid and immune functions in sponges, and suggest that a primordial neuro-immune system cleared intruders and controlled ciliary beating for feeding.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Stimjim open source hardware for precise electrical stimulation, bioRxiv, 2019-09-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractElectrical stimulation is a simple and powerful tool to perturb and evoke neuronal activity in order to understand the function of neurons and neural circuits. Despite this, devices that can provide precise current or voltage stimulation are expensive and closed-source. Here, we introduce Stimjim, a capable and inexpensive ($200 USD) open-source instrument for electrical stimulation that combines both function generation and electrical isolation. Stimjim provides microsecond temporal resolution with microampere or millivolt scale precision on two electrically isolated output channels. We demonstrate Stimjim’s utility both in vitro by precisely stimulating brain slices, and in vivo by training mice to perform intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) for brain stimulation reward. During ICSS, Stimjim enables the experimenter to smoothly tune the strength of reward-seeking behavior by varying either the output frequency or amplitude. We envision Stimjim will enable new kinds of experiments due to its open-source and scalable nature.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bayesian analysis of GWAS summary data reveals differential signatures of natural selection across human complex traits and functional genomic categories, bioRxiv, 2019-09-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding how natural selection has shaped the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases is of importance in medical and evolutionary genetics. Bayesian methods have been developed using individual-level data to estimate multiple features of genetic architecture, including signatures of natural selection. Here, we present an enhanced method (SBayesS) that only requires GWAS summary statistics and incorporates functional genomic annotations. We analysed GWAS data with large sample sizes for 155 complex traits and detected pervasive signatures of negative selection with diverse estimates of SNP-based heritability and polygenicity. Projecting these estimates onto a map of genetic architecture obtained from evolutionary simulations revealed relatively strong natural selection on genetic variants associated with cardiorespiratory and cognitive traits and relatively small number of mutational targets for diseases. Averaging across traits, the joint distribution of SNP effect size and MAF varied across functional genomic regions (likely to be a consequence of natural selection), with enrichment in both the number of associated variants and the magnitude of effect sizes in regions such as transcriptional start sites, coding regions and 5’- and 3’-UTRs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Robustness and applicability of functional genomics tools on scRNA-seq data, bioRxiv, 2019-09-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractMany tools have been developed to extract functional and mechanistic insight from bulk transcriptome profiling data. With the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is in principle possible to do such an analysis for single cells. However, scRNA-seq data has characteristics such as drop-out events, low library sizes and a comparatively large number of samplescells. It is thus not clear if functional genomics tools established for bulk sequencing can be applied to scRNA-seq in a meaningful way. To address this question, we performed benchmark studies on in silico and in vitro single-cell RNA-seq data. We included the bulk-RNA tools PROGENy, GO enrichment and DoRothEA that estimate pathway and transcription factor (TF) activities, respectively, and compared them against the tools AUCell and metaVIPER, designed for scRNA-seq. For the in silico study we simulated single cells from TFpathway perturbation bulk RNA-seq experiments. Our simulation strategy guarantees that the information of the original perturbation is preserved while resembling the characteristics of scRNA-seq data. We complemented the in silico data with in vitro scRNA-seq data upon CRISPR-mediated knock-out. Our benchmarks on both the simulated and real data revealed comparable performance to the original bulk data. Additionally, we showed that the TF and pathway activities preserve cell-type specific variability by analysing a mixture sample sequenced with 13 scRNA-seq different protocols. Our analyses suggest that bulk functional genomics tools can be applied to scRNA-seq data, outperforming dedicated single cell tools. Furthermore we provide a benchmark for further methods development by the community.</p>
