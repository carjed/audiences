          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Oxford Nanopore Sequencing, Hybrid Error Correction, and de novo Assembly of a Eukaryotic Genome, bioRxiv, 2015-01-15</h4>
          <p>Monitoring the progress of DNA molecules through a membrane pore has been postulated as a method for sequencing DNA for several decades. Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available that we used for sequencing the S. cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr (httpsgithub.comjgurtowskinanocorr) specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, as existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5-50kbp) at such high error rate (between ~5 and 40% error). With this new method we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate the contig N50 length is more than ten-times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678kb versus 59.9kbp), and has greater than 99.88% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assembling Large Genomes with Single-Molecule Sequencing and Locality Sensitive Hashing, bioRxiv, 2014-08-15</h4>
          <p>We report reference-grade de novo assemblies of four model organisms and the human genome from single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Long-read SMRT sequencing is routinely used to finish microbial genomes, but the available assembly methods have not scaled well to larger genomes. Here we introduce the MinHash Alignment Process (MHAP) for efficient overlapping of noisy, long reads using probabilistic, locality-sensitive hashing. Together with Celera Assembler, MHAP was used to reconstruct the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and human from high-coverage SMRT sequencing. The resulting assemblies include fully resolved chromosome arms and close persistent gaps in these important reference genomes, including heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences. For D. melanogaster, MHAP achieved a 600-fold speedup relative to prior methods and a cloud computing cost of a few hundred dollars. These results demonstrate that single-molecule sequencing alone can produce near-complete eukaryotic genomes at modest cost.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reagent contamination can critically impact sequence-based microbiome analyses, bioRxiv, 2014-07-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe study of microbial communities has been revolutionised in recent years by the widespread adoption of culture independent analytical techniques such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomics. One potential confounder of these sequence-based approaches is the presence of contamination in DNA extraction kits and other laboratory reagents. In this study we demonstrate that contaminating DNA is ubiquitous in commonly used DNA extraction kits, varies greatly in composition between different kits and kit batches, and that this contamination critically impacts results obtained from samples containing a low microbial biomass. Contamination impacts both PCR based 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics. These results suggest that caution should be advised when applying sequence-based techniques to the study of microbiota present in low biomass environments. We provide an extensive list of potential contaminating genera, and guidelines on how to mitigate the effects of contamination. Concurrent sequencing of negative control samples is strongly advised.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Illumina TruSeq synthetic long-reads empowerde novoassembly and resolve complex, highly repetitive transposable elements, bioRxiv, 2014-01-22</h4>
          <p>High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized genomic analysis, including thede novoassembly of whole genomes. Nevertheless, assembly of complex genomes remains challenging, in part due to the presence of dispersed repeats which introduce ambiguity during genome reconstruction. Transposable elements (TEs) can be particularly problematic, especially for TE families exhibiting high sequence identity, high copy number, or present in complex genomic arrangements. While TEs strongly affect genome function and evolution, most currentde novoassembly approaches cannot resolve long, identical, and abundant families of TEs. Here, we applied a novel Illumina technology called TruSeq synthetic long-reads, which are generated through highly parallel library preparation and local assembly of short read data and achieve lengths of 1.5-18.5 Kbp with an extremely low error rate (∼0.03% per base). To test the utility of this technology, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the model organismDrosophila melanogaster(reference genome strainy;cn,bw,sp) achieving an N50 contig size of 69.7 Kbp and covering 96.9% of the euchromatic chromosome arms of the current reference genome. TruSeq synthetic long-read technology enables placement of individual TE copies in their proper genomic locations as well as accurate reconstruction of TE sequences. We entirely recovered and accurately placed 4,229 (77.8%) of the 5,434 of annotated transposable elements with perfect identity to the current reference genome. As TEs are ubiquitous features of genomes of many species, TruSeq synthetic long- reads, and likely other methods that generate long reads, offer a powerful approach to improvede novoassemblies of whole genomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans, bioRxiv, 2013-12-24</h4>
          <p>We sequenced genomes from a ~7,000 year old early farmer from Stuttgart in Germany, an ~8,000 year old hunter-gatherer from Luxembourg, and seven ~8,000 year old hunter-gatherers from southern Sweden. We analyzed these data together with other ancient genomes and 2,345 contemporary humans to show that the great majority of present-day Europeans derive from at least three highly differentiated populations West European Hunter-Gatherers (WHG), who contributed ancestry to all Europeans but not to Near Easterners; Ancient North Eurasians (ANE), who were most closely related to Upper Paleolithic Siberians and contributed to both Europeans and Near Easterners; and Early European Farmers (EEF), who were mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harbored WHG-related ancestry. We model these populations&#39; deep relationships and show that EEF had ~44% ancestry from a Basal Eurasian lineage that split prior to the diversification of all other non-African lineages.</p>
