          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phasic Activation of Ventral Tegmental, but not Substantia Nigra, Dopamine Neurons Promotes Model-Based Pavlovian Reward Learning, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTDopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SNc) encode reward prediction errors (RPEs) and are proposed to mediate error-driven learning. However the learning strategy engaged by DA-RPEs remains controversial. Model-free associations imbue cueactions with pure value, independently of representations of their associated outcome. In contrast, model-based associations support detailed representation of anticipated outcomes. Here we show that although both VTA and SNc DA neuron activation reinforces instrumental responding, only VTA DA neuron activation during consumption of expected sucrose reward restores error-driven learning and promotes formation of a new cue→sucrose association. Critically, expression of VTA DA-dependent Pavlovian associations is abolished following sucrose devaluation, a signature of model-based learning. These findings reveal that activation of VTA-or SNc-DA neurons engages largely dissociable learning processes with VTA-DA neurons capable of participating in model-based predictive learning, while the role of SNc-DA neurons appears limited to reinforcement of instrumental responses.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTPathway enrichment analysis helps gain mechanistic insight into large gene lists typically resulting from genome scale (–omics) experiments. It identifies biological pathways that are enriched in the gene list more than expected by chance. We explain pathway enrichment analysis and present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene lists resulting from RNA-seq and genome sequencing experiments. The protocol comprises three major steps define a gene list from genome scale data, determine statistically enriched pathways, and visualize and interpret the results. We focus on differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes, however the described principles can be applied to diverse –omics data. The protocol is designed for biologists with no prior bioinformatics training and uses freely available software including gProfiler, GSEA, Cytoscape and Enrichment Map.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe changes in gene content that preceded the origin of animals can be reconstructed by comparison with their sister group, the choanoflagellates. However, only two choanoflagellate genomes are currently available, providing poor coverage of their diversity. We sequenced transcriptomes of 19 additional choanoflagellate species to produce a comprehensive reconstruction of the gains and losses that shaped the ancestral animal gene repertoire. We find roughly 1,700 gene families with origins on the animal stem lineage, of which only a core set of 36 are conserved across animals. We find more than 350 gene families that were previously thought to be animal-specific actually evolved before the animal-choanoflagellate divergence, including Notch and Delta, Toll-like receptors, and glycosaminoglycan hydrolases that regulate animal extracellular matrix (ECM). In the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca helianthica, we show that a glycosaminoglycan hydrolase modulates rosette colony size, suggesting a link between ECM regulation and morphogenesis in choanoflagellates and animals.Data AvailabilityRaw sequencing reads NCBI BioProject PRJNA419411 (19 choanoflagellate transcriptomes), PRJNA420352 (S. rosetta polyA selection test)Transcriptome assemblies, annotations, and gene families &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsdx.doi.org10.6084m9.figshare.5686984&gt;httpsdx.doi.org10.6084m9.figshare.5686984&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Protocols &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsdx.doi.org10.17504protocols.io.kwscxee&gt;httpsdx.doi.org10.17504protocols.io.kwscxee&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-efficiency optogenetic silencing with soma-targeted anion-conducting channelrhodopsins, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractOptogenetic silencing allows time-resolved functional interrogation of defined neuronal populations. However, the limitations of inhibitory optogenetic tools impose stringent constraints on experimental paradigms. The high light power requirement of light-driven ion pumps and their effects on intracellular ion homeostasis pose unique challenges, particularly in experiments that demand inhibition of a widespread neuronal population in vivo. Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (GtACRs) are promising in this regard, due to their high single-channel conductance and favorable photon-ion stoichiometry. However, GtACRs show poor membrane targeting in mammalian cells, and the activity of such channels can cause transient excitation in the axon due to an excitatory chloride reversal potential in this compartment. Here we address both problems by enhancing membrane targeting and subcellular compartmentalization of GtACRs. The resulting GtACR-based optogenetic tools show improved photocurrents, greatly reduced axonal excitation, high light sensitivity and rapid kinetics, allowing highly efficient inhibition of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractPrevious studies of the genetic landscape of Ireland have suggested homogeneity, with population substructure undetectable using single-marker methods. Here we have harnessed the haplotype-based method fineSTRUCTURE in an Irish genome-wide SNP dataset, identifying 23 discrete genetic clusters which segregate with geographical provenance. Cluster diversity is pronounced in the west of Ireland but reduced in the east where older structure has been eroded by historical migrations. Accordingly, when populations from the neighbouring island of Britain are included, a west-east cline of Celtic-British ancestry is revealed along with a particularly striking correlation between haplotypes and geography across both islands. A strong relationship is revealed between subsets of Northern Irish and Scottish populations, where discordant genetic and geographic affinities reflect major migrations in recent centuries. Additionally, Irish genetic proximity of all Scottish samples likely reflects older strata of communication across the narrowest inter-island crossing. Using GLOBETROTTER we detected Irish admixture signals from Britain and Europe and estimated dates for events consistent with the historical migrations of the Norse-Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and the British Plantations. The influence of the former is greater than previously estimated from Y chromosome haplotypes. In all, we paint a new picture of the genetic landscape of Ireland, revealing structure which should be considered in the design of studies examining rare genetic variation and its association with traits.Author summaryA recent genetic study of the UK (People of the British Isles; PoBI) expanded our understanding of population history of the islands, using newly-developed, powerful techniques that harness the rich information embedded in chunks of genetic code called haplotypes. These methods revealed subtle regional diversity across the UK, and, using genetic data alone, timed key migration events into southeast England and Orkney. We have extended these methods to Ireland, identifying regional differences in genetics across the island that adhere to geography at a resolution not previously reported. Our study reveals relative western diversity and eastern homogeneity in Ireland owing to a history of settlement concentrated on the east coast and longstanding Celtic diversity in the west. We show that Irish Celtic diversity enriches the findings of PoBI; haplotypes mirror geography across Britain and Ireland, with relic Celtic populations contributing greatly to haplotypic diversity. Finally, we used genetic information to date migrations into Ireland from Europe and Britain consistent with historical records of Viking and Norman invasions, demonstrating the signatures of these migrations the on modern Irish genome. Our findings demonstrate that genetic structure exists in even small isolated populations, which has important implications for population-based genetic association studies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTActivity in motor cortex predicts specific movements, seconds before they are initiated. This preparatory activity has been observed in L5 descending ‘pyramidal tract’ (PT) neurons. A key question is how preparatory activity can be maintained without causing movement, and how preparatory activity is eventually converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. We used single cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions to identify two types of PT neuron. Both types share projections to multiple targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex. In a delayed-response task, these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement. The second type projects to motor centers in the medulla and produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two motor cortex output neurons are specialized for distinct roles in motor control.</p>
