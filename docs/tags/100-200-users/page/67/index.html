          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nanotube-mediated cross-feeding couples the metabolism of interacting bacterial cells, bioRxiv, 2017-03-07</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBacteria frequently engage in cross-feeding interactions that involve an exchange of metabolites with other micro- or macroorganisms. The often obligate nature of these associations, however, hampers manipulative experiments, thus limiting our mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiological consequences that result for the organisms involved. Here we address this issue by taking advantage of a well-characterised experimental model system, in which auxotrophic genotypes of E. coli derive essential amino acid from prototrophic donor cells using intercellular nanotubes. Surprisingly, donor-recipient cocultures revealed that the mere presence of auxotrophic genotypes in coculture was sufficient to increase amino acid production levels in donor cells. Subsequent experiments unravelled that this effect was due to the depletion of amino acid concentrations in the cytoplasm of donor cells, which delayed feedback inhibition of the corresponding amino acid biosynthetic pathway. This finding indicates that in newly established mutualistic associations, an intercellular regulation of exchanged metabolites can simply emerge from the architecture of the underlying biosynthetic pathways, rather than through the evolution of new regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our results show that a single loss-of-function mutation can physiologically couple the metabolism of two cross-feeding cells in a source-sink-like relationship.</p>

          <p>Recent high-throughput single-cell sequencing approaches have been transformative for understanding complex cell populations, but are unable to provide additional phenotypic information, such as protein levels of cell-surface markers. Using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies, we integrate measurements of cellular proteins and transcriptomes into an efficient, sequencing-based readout of single cells. This method is compatible with existing single-cell sequencing approaches and will readily scale as the throughput of these methods increase.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">orco mutagenesis causes loss of antennal lobe glomeruli and impaired social behavior in ants, bioRxiv, 2017-03-01</h4>
          <p>Life inside ant colonies is orchestrated with a diverse set of pheromones, but it is not clear how ants perceive these social cues. It has been proposed that pheromone perception in ants evolved via expansions in the numbers of odorant receptors (ORs) and antennal lobe glomeruli. Here we generate the first mutant lines in ants by disrupting orco, a gene required for the function of all ORs. We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, suggesting that they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli found in wild-types. These results illustrate that ORs are essential for ant social organization, and raise the possibility that, similar to mammals, receptor function is required for the development andor maintenance of the highly complex olfactory processing areas in the ant brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A global perspective on bioinformatics training needs, bioRxiv, 2017-02-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the last decade, life-science research has become increasingly data-intensive and computational. Nevertheless, basic bioinformatics and data stewardship are still only rarely taught in life-science degree programmes, creating a widening skills gap that spans educational levels and career roles. To better understand this situation, we ran surveys to determine how the skills dearth is affecting the need for bioinformatics training worldwide. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that respondents wanted more short courses to help boost their expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation. However, it was evident that most respondents appreciated their need for training only after designing their experiments and collecting their data. This is clearly rather late in the research workflow, and suboptimal from a training perspective, as skills acquired to address a specific need at a particular time are seldom retained, engendering a cycle of low confidence in trainees. To ensure that such skill gaps do not continue to create barriers to the progress of research, we argue that universities should strive to bring their life-science curricula into the digital-data era. Meanwhile, the demand for point-of-need training in bioinformatics and data stewardship will grow. While this situation persists, international groups like GOBLET are increasing their efforts to enlarge the community of trainers and quench the global thirst for bioinformatics training.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell epigenomics maps the continuous regulatory landscape of human hematopoietic differentiation, bioRxiv, 2017-02-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractNormal human hematopoiesis involves cellular differentiation of multipotent cells into progressively more lineage-restricted states. While epigenomic landscapes of this process have been explored in immunophenotypically-defined populations, the single-cell regulatory variation that defines hematopoietic differentiation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We generated single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes across 8 populations of immunophenotypically-defined human hematopoietic cell types. Using bulk chromatin accessibility profiles to scaffold our single-cell data analysis, we constructed an epigenomic landscape of human hematopoiesis and characterized epigenomic heterogeneity within phenotypically sorted populations to find epigenomic lineage-bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent stem cell states. We identify and isolate sub-populations within classically-defined granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and use ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to confirm that GMPs are epigenomically and transcriptomically heterogeneous. Furthermore, we identified transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements linked to changes in chromatin accessibility within cellular populations and across a continuous myeloid developmental trajectory, and observe relatively simple TF motif dynamics give rise to a broad diversity of accessibility dynamics at cis-regulatory elements. Overall, this work provides a template for exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in primary human tissues at the ultimate level of granular specificity – the single cell.One Sentence SummarySingle cell chromatin accessibility reveals a high-resolution, continuous landscape of regulatory variation in human hematopoiesis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cas9-Assisted Targeting of CHromosome segments (CATCH) for targeted nanopore sequencing and optical genome mapping, bioRxiv, 2017-02-21</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTVariations in the genetic code, from single point mutations to large structural or copy number alterations, influence susceptibility, onset, and progression of genetic diseases and tumor transformation. Next-generation sequencing analysis is unable to reliably capture aberrations larger than the typical sequencing read length of several hundred bases. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing methods such as SMRT and nanopore sequencing can address larger variations, but require costly whole genome analysis. Here we describe a method for isolation and enrichment of a large genomic region of interest for targeted analysis based on Cas9 excision of two sites flanking the target region and isolation of the excised DNA segment by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The isolated target remains intact and is ideally suited for optical genome mapping and long-read sequencing at high coverage. In addition, analysis is performed directly on native genomic DNA that retains genetic and epigenetic composition without amplification bias. This method enables detection of mutations and structural variants as well as detailed analysis by generation of hybrid scaffolds composed of optical maps and sequencing data at a fraction of the cost of whole genome sequencing.</p>
