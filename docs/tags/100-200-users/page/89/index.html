          <p>AbstractChromosome organization poses a remarkable physical problem with many biological consequences how can molecular interactions between proteins at the nanometer scale organize micron-long chromatinized DNA molecules, insulating or facilitating interactions between specific genomic elements? The mechanism of active loop extrusion holds great promise for explaining interphase and mitotic chromosome folding, yet remains difficult to assay directly. We discuss predictions from our polymer models of loop extrusion with barrier elements, and review recent experimental studies that provide strong support for loop extrusion, focusing on perturbations to CTCF and cohesin assayed via Hi-C in interphase. Finally, we discuss a likely molecular mechanism of loop extrusion by SMC complexes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Motor cortex is an input-driven dynamical system controlling dexterous movement, bioRxiv, 2018-02-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractSkillful control of movement is central to our ability to sense and manipulate the world. A large body of work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated that motor cortex provides flexible, time-varying activity patterns that control the arm during reaching and grasping. Previous studies have suggested that these patterns are generated by strong local recurrent dynamics operating autonomously from inputs during movement execution. An alternative possibility is that motor cortex requires coordination with upstream brain regions throughout the entire movement in order to yield these patterns. Here, we developed an experimental preparation in the mouse to directly test these possibilities using optogenetics and electrophysiology during a skilled reach-to-grab-to-eat task. To validate this preparation, we first established that a specific, time-varying pattern of motor cortical activity was required to produce coordinated movement. Next, in order to disentangle the contribution of local recurrent motor cortical dynamics from external input, we optogenetically held the recurrent contribution constant, then observed how motor cortical activity recovered following the end of this perturbation. Both the neural responses and hand trajectory varied from trial to trial, and this variability reflected variability in external inputs. To directly probe the role of these inputs, we used optogenetics to perturb activity in the thalamus. Thalamic perturbation at the start of the trial prevented movement initiation, and perturbation at any stage of the movement prevented progression of the hand to the target; this demonstrates that input is required throughout the movement. By comparing motor cortical activity with and without thalamic perturbation, we were able to estimate the effects of external inputs on motor cortical population activity. Thus, unlike pattern-generating circuits that are local and autonomous, such as those in the spinal cord that generate left-right alternation during locomotion, the pattern generator for reaching and grasping is distributed across multiple, strongly-interacting brain regions.</p>

          <p>AbstractSingle-cell RNA-Seq makes it possible to characterize the transcriptomes of cell types and identify their transcriptional signatures via differential analysis. We present a fast and accurate method for discriminating cell types that takes advantage of the large numbers of cells that are assayed. When applied to transcript compatibility counts obtained via pseudoalignment, our approach provides a quantification-free analysis of 3’ single-cell RNA-Seq that can identify previously undetectable marker genes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Histology Image Analysis, bioRxiv, 2018-02-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractBreast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. Early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-aided diagnosis systems showed potential for improving the diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we develop the computational approach based on deep convolution neural networks for breast cancer histology image classification. Hematoxylin and eosin stained breast histology microscopy image dataset is provided as a part of the ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology Images. Our approach utilizes several deep neural network architectures and gradient boosted trees classifier. For 4-class classification task, we report 87.2% accuracy. For 2-class classification task to detect carcinomas we report 93.8% accuracy, AUC 97.3%, and sensitivityspecificity 96.588.0% at the high-sensitivity operating point. To our knowledge, this approach outperforms other common methods in automated histopathological image classification. The source code for our approach is made publicly available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comalexander-rakhlinICIAR2018&gt;httpsgithub.comalexander-rakhlinICIAR2018&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Integrating Hi-C links with assembly graphs for chromosome-scale assembly, bioRxiv, 2018-02-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractLong-read sequencing and novel long-range assays have revolutionized de novo genome assembly by automating the reconstruction of reference-quality genomes. In particular, Hi-C sequencing is becoming an economical method for generating chromosome-scale scaffolds. Despite its increasing popularity, there are limited open-source tools available. Errors, particularly inversions and fusions across chromosomes, remain higher than alternate scaffolding technologies. We present a novel open-source Hi-C scaffolder that does not require an a priori estimate of chromosome number and minimizes errors by scaffolding with the assistance of an assembly graph. We demonstrate higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods across a variety of Hi-C library preparations and input assembly sizes. The Python and C&#43;&#43; code for our method is openly available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.commachinegunSALSA&gt;httpsgithub.commachinegunSALSA&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Author summaryHi-C technology was originally proposed to study the 3D organization of a genome. Recently, it has also been applied to assemble large eukaryotic genomes into chromosome-scale scaffolds. Despite this, there are few open source methods to generate these assemblies. Existing methods are also prone to small inversion errors due to noise in the Hi-C data. In this work, we address these challenges and develop a method, named SALSA2. SALSA2 uses sequence overlap information from an assembly graph to correct inversion errors and provide accurate chromosome-scale assemblies.</p>

          <p>AbstractInsomnia is the second-most prevalent mental disorder, with no sufficient treatment available. Despite a substantial role of genetic factors, only a handful of genes have been implicated and insight into the associated neurobiological pathways remains limited. Here, we use an unprecedented large genetic association sample (N=1,331,010) to allow detection of a substantial number of genetic variants and gain insight into biological functions, cell types and tissues involved in insomnia complaints. We identify 202 genome-wide significant loci implicating 956 genes through positional, eQTL and chromatin interaction mapping. We show involvement of the axonal part of neurons, of specific cortical and subcortical tissues, and of two specific cell-types in insomnia striatal medium spiny neurons and hypothalamic neurons. These cell-types have been implicated previously in the regulation of reward processing, sleep and arousal in animal studies, but have never been genetically linked to insomnia in humans. We found weak genetic correlations with other sleep-related traits, but strong genetic correlations with psychiatric and metabolic traits. Mendelian randomization identified causal effects of insomnia on specific psychiatric and metabolic traits. Our findings reveal key brain areas and cells implicated in the neurobiology of insomnia and its related disorders, and provide novel targets for treatment.</p>
