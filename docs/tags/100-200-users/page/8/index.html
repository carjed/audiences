          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell transcriptomics reveals expansion of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells in supercentenarians, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractSupercentenarians, people who have reached 110 years of age, are a great model of healthy aging. Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from seven supercentenarians and five younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells (CD4 CTLs) coupled with a substantial reduction of B-cells as a novel signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing of two supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15% to 35% of the entire CD4 T-cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.SignificanceExceptionally long-lived people such as supercentenarians tend to spend their entire lives in good health, implying that their immune system remains active to protect against infections and tumors. However, their immunological condition has been largely unexplored. We profiled thousands of circulating immune cells from supercentenarians at single-cell resolution, and identified a large number of CD4 T-cells that have cytotoxic features. This characteristic is very unique to supercentenarians, because generally CD4 T-cells have helper, but not cytotoxic, functions under physiological conditions. We further profiled their T-cell receptors, and revealed that the cytotoxic CD4 T-cells were accumulated through clonal expansion. The conversion of helper CD4 T-cells to a cytotoxic variety might be an adaptation to the late stage of aging.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Spatiotemporal limits of optogenetic manipulations in cortical circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractNeuronal inactivation is commonly used to assess the involvement of groups of neurons in specific brain functions. Optogenetic tools allow manipulations of genetically and spatially defined neuronal populations with excellent temporal resolution. However, the targeted neurons are coupled with other neural populations over multiple length scales. As a result, the effects of localized optogenetic manipulations are not limited to the targeted neurons, but produces spatially extended excitation and inhibition with rich dynamics. Here we benchmarked several optogenetic silencers in transgenic mice and with viral gene transduction, with the goal to inactivate excitatory neurons in small regions of neocortex. We analyzed the effects of the perturbations in vivo using electrophysiology. Channelrhodopsin activation of GABAergic neurons produced more effective photoinhibition of pyramidal neurons than direct photoinhibition using light-gated ion pumps. We made transgenic mice expressing the light-dependent chloride channel GtACR under the control of Cre-recombinase. Activation of GtACR produced the most potent photoinhibition. For all methods, localized photostimuli produced photoinhibition that extended substantially beyond the spread of light in tissue, although different methods had slightly different resolution limits (radius of inactivation, 0.5 mm to 1 mm). The spatial profile of photoinhibition was likely shaped by strong coupling between cortical neurons. Over some range of photostimulation, circuits produced the “paradoxical effect”, where excitation of inhibitory neurons reduced activity in these neurons, together with pyramidal neurons, a signature of inhibition-stabilized neural networks. The offset of optogenetic inactivation was followed by rebound excitation in a light dose-dependent manner, which can be mitigated by slowly varying photostimuli, but at the expense of time resolution. Our data offer guidance for the design of in vivo optogenetics experiments and suggest how these experiments can reveal operating principles of neural circuits.</p>

          <p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that exhibit a complex inner architecture. They exhibit a smooth outer membrane and a highly convoluted inner membrane that forms invaginations called cristae. Imaging cristae in living cells poses a formidable challenge for light microscopy. Relying on a cell line stably expressing the mitochondrial protein Cox8A fused to the SNAP-tag and using STED (stimulated emission depletion) super-resolution microscopy, we demonstrate the visualization of cristae dynamics in cultivated human cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Non-replication of functional connectivity differences in ASD a multi-site study, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractA large and rapidly growing number of studies on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have used resting-state fMRI to identify various alterations of functional connectivity (FC), with the hope of identifying clinically useful biomarkers or neural mechanisms underlying ASD. However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing this lack of replicability. Here, we used resting-state (rs-fMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I and II) to investigate two factors thought to strongly influence replicability the use of different denoising methods (i.e., data preprocessing) and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition parameters, etc.). Using four independently acquired datasets and 31 different denoising strategies, we examined the replicability of patterns of both group-averaged functional connectomes and group-level differences (i.e., ASD vs. control). Within datasets, both group-averages and group-comparisons of functional connectomes were highly consistent (r = 0.92 ±0.06  r = 0.80±0.09) across different pipelines, with the largest differences across pipelines reflecting whether global signal regression (GSR) was used. However, across datasets, while group-averages were still highly consistent (r = 0.86±0.02), group differences did not replicate, regardless of denoising strategy indeed, consistency of group differences was so low (r = 0.09±0.05) that differences identified in one dataset had essentially no relationship with those in other datasets. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at the network (as opposed to edge) level. Because there are a number of additional methodological factors that can influence the reliable detection of group differences (e.g., scanner-related differences, subject differences, post-processing analysis, effect sizes of ASD alterations, amount and quality of data), these results cannot completely rule out the existence of replicable resting-state FC differences in ASD. However, they do highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when describing and interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rare microbes from diverse Earth biomes dominate community activity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractMicrobes are the Earth’s most numerous organisms and are instrumental in driving major global biological and chemical processes. Microbial activity is a crucial component of all ecosystems, as microbes have the potential to control any major biochemical process. In recent years, considerable strides have been made in describing the community structure, i.e. diversity and abundance, of microbes from the Earth’s major biomes. In virtually all environments studied, a few highly abundant taxa dominate the structure of microbial communities. Still, microbial diversity is high and is concentrated in the less abundant, or rare, fractions of the community, i.e. the “long tail” of the abundance distribution. The relationship between microbial community structure and activity, specifically the role of rare microbes, and its connection to ecosystem function, is not fully understood. We analyzed 12.3 million metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence assemblies and their genes from environmental, human, and engineered microbiomes, and show that microbial activity is dominated by rare microbes (96% of total activity) across all measured biomes. Further, rare microbial activity was comprised of traits that are fundamental to ecosystem and organismal health, e.g. biogeochemical cycling and infectious disease. The activity of rare microbes was also tightly coupled to temperature, revealing a link between basic biological processes, e.g. reaction rates, and community activity. Our study provides a broadly applicable and predictable paradigm that implicates rare microbes as the main microbial drivers of ecosystem function and organismal health.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Resolving the 3D landscape of transcription-linked mammalian chromatin folding, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTChromatin folding below the scale of topologically associating domains (TADs) remains largely unexplored in mammals. Here, we used a high-resolution 3C-based method, Micro-C, to probe links between 3D-genome organization and transcriptional regulation in mouse stem cells. Combinatorial binding of transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin modifiers spatially segregate TAD regions into “microTADs” with distinct regulatory features. Enhancer-promoter and promoter-promoter interactions extending from the edge of these domains predominantly link co-regulated loci, often independently of CTCFCohesin. Acute inhibition of transcription disrupts the gene-related folding features without altering higher-order chromatin structures. Intriguingly, we detect “two-start” zig-zag 30-nanometer chromatin fibers. Our work uncovers the finer-scale genome organization that establishes novel functional links between chromatin folding and gene regulation.ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYTranscriptional regulatory elements shape 3D genome architecture of microTADs.</p>
