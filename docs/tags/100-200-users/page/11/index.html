          <p>ABSTRACTA multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell andor single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development.</p>

          <p>AbstractRecent developments in stem cell biology have enabled the study of cell fate decisions in early human development that are impossible to study in vivo. However, understanding how development varies across individuals and, in particular, the influence of common genetic variants during this process has not been characterised. Here, we exploit human iPS cell lines from 125 donors, a pooled experimental design, and single-cell RNA-sequencing to study population variation of endoderm differentiation. We identify molecular markers that are predictive of differentiation efficiency, and utilise heterogeneity in the genetic background across individuals to map hundreds of expression quantitative trait loci that influence expression dynamically during differentiation and across cellular contexts.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Levels of Representation in a Deep Learning Model of Categorization, bioRxiv, 2019-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractDeep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) rival humans in object recognition. The layers (or levels of representation) in DCNNs have been successfully aligned with processing stages along the ventral stream for visual processing. Here, we propose a model of concept learning that uses visual representations from these networks to build memory representations of novel categories, which may rely on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our approach opens up two possibilities a) formal investigations can involve photographic stimuli as opposed to stimuli handcrafted and coded by the experimenter; b) model comparison can determine which level of representation within a DCNN a learner is using during categorization decisions. Pursuing the latter point, DCNNs suggest that the shape bias in children relies on representations at more advanced network layers whereas a learner that relied on lower network layers would display a color bias. These results confirm the role of natural statistics in the shape bias (i.e., shape is predictive of category membership) while highlighting that the type of statistics matter, i.e., those from lower or higher levels of representation. We use the same approach to provide evidence that pigeons performing seemingly sophisticated categorization of complex imagery may in fact be relying on representations that are very low-level (i.e., retinotopic). Although complex features, such as shape, relatively predominate at more advanced network layers, even simple features, such as spatial frequency and orientation, are better represented at the more advanced layers, contrary to a standard hierarchical view.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Long metabarcoding of the eukaryotic rDNA operon to phylogenetically and taxonomically resolve environmental diversity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractHigh-throughput environmental DNA metabarcoding has revolutionized the analysis of microbial diversity, but this approach is generally restricted to amplicon sizes below 500 base pairs. These short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. However, new long-read sequencing technologies such as the Pacific Biosciences platform may provide sufficiently large sequence lengths to overcome the poor phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain a ~4500 bp region of the eukaryotic rDNA operon spanning most of the small (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA genes. The CCS reads were first treated with a novel curation workflow that generated 650 high-quality OTUs containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions of the long amplicons. In order to assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based and phylogenetic placement-based methods using shorter reads. The taxonomically-annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58%) corresponded to the new long environmental CCS reads. Comparisons to the 18S-only region of our amplicons revealed that the combined 18S-28S genes globally increased the phylogenetic resolution, recovering specific groupings otherwise missing. The long-reads also allowed to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny. Altogether, our results show that long amplicons can be treated in a full phylogenetic framework to provide greater taxonomic resolution and a robust evolutionary perspective to environmental DNA.</p>

          <p>AbstractMeiosis, while critical for reproduction, is also highly variable and error prone crossover rates vary among humans and individual gametes, and chromosome nondisjunction leads to aneuploidy, a leading cause of miscarriage. To study variation in meiotic outcomes within and across individuals, we developed a way to sequence many individual sperm genomes at once. We used this method to sequence the genomes of 31,228 gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122 crossovers, 787 aneuploid chromosomes, and unexpected genomic anomalies. Different sperm donors varied four-fold in the frequency of aneuploid sperm, and aneuploid chromosomes gained in meiosis I had 36% fewer crossovers than corresponding non-aneuploid chromosomes. Diverse recombination phenotypes were surprisingly coordinated donors with high average crossover rates also made a larger fraction of their crossovers in centromere-proximal regions and placed their crossovers closer together. These same relationships were also evident in the variation among individual gametes from the same donor sperm with more crossovers tended to have made crossovers closer together and in centromere-proximal regions. Variation in the physical compaction of chromosomes could help explain this coordination of meiotic variation across chromosomes, gametes, and individuals.</p>

          <p>AbstractParasites of the genus Plasmodium cause human malaria. Yet nothing is known about the viruses that infect these divergent eukaryotes. We investigated the Plasmodium virome by performing a meta-transcriptomic analysis of blood samples from malaria patients infected with P. vivax, P. falciparum or P. knowlesi. This revealed a novel bi-segmented narna-like RNA virus restricted to P. vivax and named Matryoshka RNA virus 1 (MaRNAV-1) to reflect its “Russian doll” nature a virus, infecting a parasite, infecting an animal. MaRNAV-1 was abundant in geographically diverse P. vivax from humans and mosquitoes. Notably, a related virus (MaRNAV-2) was identified in Australian birds infected with a Leucocytozoon - eukaryotic parasites that group with Plasmodium in the Apicomplexa subclass hematozoa. This is the first report of a Plasmodium virus. As well as broadening our understanding of the eukaryotic virosphere, the restriction to P. vivax may help understand P. vivax-specific biology in humans and mosquitoes.</p>
