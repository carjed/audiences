          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Alignment and mapping methodology influence transcript abundance estimation, bioRxiv, 2019-06-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe accuracy of transcript quantification using RNA-seq data depends on many factors, such as the choice of alignment or mapping method and the quantification model being adopted. While the choice of quantification model has been shown to be important, considerably less attention has been given to comparing the effect of various read alignment approaches on quantification accuracy.We investigate the effect of mapping and alignment on the accuracy of transcript quantification in both simulated and experimental data, as well as the effect on subsequent differential gene expression analysis. We observe that, even when the quantification model itself is held fixed, the effect of choosing a different alignment methodology, or aligning reads using different parameters, on quantification estimates can sometimes be large, and can affect downstream analyses as well. These effects can go unnoticed when assessment is focused too heavily on simulated data, where the alignment task is often simpler than in experimentally-acquired samples. We discuss best practices regarding alignment for the purposes of quantification, and also introduce a new hybrid alignment methodology, called selective alignment (SA), to overcome the shortcomings of lightweight approaches without incurring the computational cost of traditional alignment.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe mammary epithelium is indispensable for the continued survival of more than 5000 mammalian species. For some, the volume of milk ejected in a single day exceeds their entire blood volume. Here, we unveil the spatiotemporal properties of physiological signals that orchestrate milk ejection. Using quantitative, multidimensional imaging of mammary cell ensembles, we reveal how stimulus-evoked Ca2&#43; oscillations couple to contraction in basal epithelial cells. Moreover, we show that Ca2&#43;-dependent contractions generate the requisite force to physically-deform the innermost layer of luminal cells, forcing them to discharge the fluid that they produced and housed. Through the collective action of thousands of these biological positive-displacement pumps, each linked to a contractile ductal network, milk is delivered into the mouth of the dependent neonate, seconds after the command.One Sentence SummaryThis study provides a window into the organization, dynamics and role of epithelial Ca2&#43; responses in the organ principally responsible for sustaining neonatal life in mammals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Minimum epistasis interpolation for sequence-function relationships, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractMassively parallel phenotyping assays have provided unprecedented insight into how multiple mutations combine to determine biological function. While these assays can measure phenotypes for thousands to millions of genotypes in a single experiment, in practice these measurements are not exhaustive, so that there is a need for techniques to impute values for genotypes whose phenotypes are not directly assayed. Here we present a method based on the idea of inferring the least epistatic possible sequence-function relationship compatible with the data. In particular, we infer the reconstruction in which mutational effects change as little as possible across adjacent genetic backgrounds. Although this method is highly conservative and has no tunable parameters, it also makes no assumptions about the form that genetic interactions take, resulting in predictions that can behave in a very complicated manner where the data require it but which are nearly additive where data is sparse or absent. We apply this method to analyze a fitness landscape for protein G, showing that our technique can provide a substantially less epistatic fit to the landscape than standard methods with little loss in predictive power. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the complex structure of epistasis observed in this dataset can be well-understood in terms of a simple qualitative model consisting of three fitness peaks where the landscape is locally additive in the vicinity of each peak.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Neanderthal-Denisovan ancestors interbred with a distantly-related hominin, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02</h4>
          <p>Previous research has shown that modern Eurasians interbred with their Neanderthal and Denisovan predecessors. We show here that hundreds of thousands of years earlier, the ancestors of Neanderthals and Denisovans interbred with their own Eurasian predecessors—members of a “superarchaic” population that separated from other humans about 2 mya. The superarchaic population was large, with an effective size between 20 and 50 thousand individuals. We confirm previous findings that (1) Denisovans also interbred with superarchaics, (2) Neanderthals and Denisovans separated early in the middle Pleistocene, (3) their ancestors endured a bottleneck of population size, and (4) the Neanderthal population was large at first but then declined in size. We provide qualified support for the view that (5) Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of modern humans.One-sentence summaryWe document the earliest known interbreeding between ancient human populations and an expansion out of Africa early in the middle Pleistocene.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics supporting design and evaluation of career-spanning education and training, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractAs the life sciences have become more data intensive, the pressure to incorporate the requisite training into life-science education and training programs has increased. To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework. The KSAs and their PLDs promote scientific problem formulation and problem solving, lending the MR-Bi durability and flexibility. With its explicit developmental trajectory, the tool can be used by developing or practicing scientists to direct their (and their team’s) acquisition of new, or to deepen existing, bioinformatics KSAs. The MR-Bi can thereby contribute to the cultivation of a next generation of bioinformaticians who are able to design reproducible and rigorous research, and to critically analyze results from their own, and others’, work.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Unconventional cell division cycles from marine-derived yeasts, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractFungi have been found in every marine habitat that has been explored, however, the diversity and functions of fungi in the ocean are poorly understood. In this study, fungi were cultured from the marine environment in the vicinity of Woods Hole, MA, USA including from plankton, sponge and coral. Our sampling resulted in 36 unique species across 20 genera. We observed many isolates by time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and analyzed modes of growth and division. Several black yeasts displayed highly unconventional cell division cycles compared to those of traditional model yeast systems. Black yeasts have been found in habitats inhospitable to other life and are known for halotolerance, virulence, and stress-resistance. We find that this group of yeasts also shows remarkable plasticity in terms of cell size control, modes of cell division, and cell polarity. Unexpected behaviors include division through a combination of fission and budding, production of multiple simultaneous buds, and cell division by sequential orthogonal septations. These marine-derived yeasts reveal alternative mechanisms for cell division cycles that seem likely to expand the repertoire of rules established from classic model system yeasts.</p>
