          <p>AbstractSingle cell segmentation is typically one of the first and most crucial tasks of image-based cellular analysis. We present a deep learning approach aiming towards a truly general method for localizing nuclei across a diverse range of assays and light microscopy modalities. We outperform the 739 methods submitted to the 2018 Data Science Bowl on images representing a variety of realistic conditions, some of which were not represented in the training data. The key to our approach is to adapt our model to unseen and unlabeled data using image style transfer to generate augmented training samples. This allows the model to recognize nuclei in new and different experiments without requiring expert annotations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Metabolic activity affects response of single cells to a nutrient switch in structured populations, bioRxiv, 2019-03-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractMicrobes live in ever-changing environments where they need to adapt their metabolism to different nutrient conditions. Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogenous cultures, however in nature microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create metabolic gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity some grow on glucose while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells’ phenotype prior to the switch it is highest for cells crossfeeding on acetate, while it depends in a non-monotonic way on growth rate for cells growing on glucose. Our results suggest that the strong phenotypic variation in spatially structured populations might enhance their ability to cope with fluctuating environments.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">PlotsOfDifferences – a web app for the quantitative comparison of unpaired data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe quantitative comparison of data acquired under different conditions is an important aspect of experimental science. The most widely used statistic for quantitative comparisons is the p-value. However, p-values suffer from several shortcomings. The most prominent shortcoming that is relevant for quantitative comparisons is that p-values fail to convey the magnitude of differences. The differences between conditions are best quantified by the determination of effect size. To democratize the calculation of effect size, we have developed a web-based tool. The tool uses bootstrapping to resample mean or median values for each of the conditions and these values are used to calculate the effect size and their compatibility interval. The web tool generates a graphical output, showing the bootstrap distribution of the difference next to the actual data for optimal interpretation. A tabular output with statistics and effect sizes is also generated and the table can be supplemented with p-values that are calculated with a randomization test. The app that we report here is dubbed PlotsOfDifferences and is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpshuygens.science.uva.nlPlotsOfDifferences&gt;httpshuygens.science.uva.nlPlotsOfDifferences&lt;jatsext-link&gt;&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float fig-type=figure orientation=portrait&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=578575_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;</p>

          <p>AbstractTrainees in medicine are taught to diagnose and administer treatment as needed; time-of-day is rarely considered. Yet accumulating evidence shows that ∼half of human genes and physiologic functions follow daily rhythms. Circadian medicine aims to incorporate knowledge of these rhythms to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Interest in this approach goes back at least six decades, but the path to the clinic has been marked by starts, stops, and ambiguity. How do we move the field forward to impact clinical practice? To gain insight into successful strategies, we studied the results of more than 100 human trials that evaluated time-of-administration of drugs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolutionary dynamics in structured populations under strong population genetic forces, bioRxiv, 2019-03-16</h4>
          <p>High rates of migration between subpopulations result in little population differentiation in the long-term neutral equilibrium. However, in the short-term, even very abundant migration may not be enough for subpopulations to equilibrate immediately. In this study, we investigate dynamical patterns of short-term population differentiation in adapting populations via stochastic and analytical modeling through time. We characterize a regime in which selection and migration interact to create non-monotonic patterns of the population differentiation statistic FST when migration is weaker than selection, but stronger than drift. We demonstrate how these patterns can be leveraged to estimate high migration rates that would lead to panmixia in the long term equilibrium using an approximate Bayesian computation approach. We apply this approach to estimate fast migration in a rapidly adapting intra-host Simian-HIV population sampled from different anatomical locations. Notably, we find differences in estimated migration rates between different compartments, all above  Nem = 1. This work demonstrates how studying demographic processes on the timescale of selective sweeps illuminates processes too fast to leave signatures on neutral timescales.</p>

          <p>SUMMARYStructural variants (SVs) rearrange the linear and three-dimensional organization of the genome, which can have profound consequences in evolution, diversity, and disease. As national biobanks, human disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population references for small variants (i.e., SNVs &amp;amp; indels) in protein-coding genes, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. However, no comparable large-scale reference maps for SVs exist to date. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis, in the general population. The mutation rates and densities of SVs were non-uniform across chromosomes and SV classes. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reflect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. The average genome in gnomAD-SV harbored 8,202 SVs, and approximately eight genes altered by rare SVs. When incorporating these data with pLoF SNVs, we estimate that SVs comprise at least 25% of all rare pLoF events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼132 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental finding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted differences in frequencies across populations and confirmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants. In total, gnomAD-SV includes at least one CNV covering 57% of the genome, while the remaining 43% is significantly enriched for CNVs found in tumors and individuals with developmental disorders. However, current sample sizes remain markedly underpowered to establish estimates of SV constraint on the level of individual genes or noncoding loci. The gnomAD-SV resources have been integrated into the gnomAD browser (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&gt;httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), where users can freely explore this dataset without restrictions on reuse, which will have broad utility in population genetics, disease association, and diagnostic screening.</p>
