          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Towards a gold standard for benchmarking gene set enrichment analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-06-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundAlthough gene set enrichment analysis has become an integral part of high-throughput gene expression data analysis, the assessment of enrichment methods remains rudimentary and ad hoc. In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are commonly restricted to selected data sets and biological reasoning on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. However, this is typically incomplete and biased towards the goals of individual investigations.ResultsWe present a general framework for standardized and structured benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization, and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression data sets investigating 42 different human diseases. The compendium features microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is associated with a precompiled GOKEGG relevance ranking for the corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods on the benchmark compendium, identifying significant differences in (i) runtime and applicability to RNA-seq data, (ii) fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the type of null hypothesis tested, and (iii) recovery of the a priori defined relevance rankings. Based on these findings, we make practical recommendations on (i) how methods originally developed for microarray data can efficiently be applied to RNA-seq data, (ii) how to interpret results depending on the type of gene set test conducted, and (iii) which methods are best suited to effectively prioritize gene sets with high relevance for the phenotype investigated.ConclusionWe carried out a systematic assessment of existing enrichment methods, and identified best performing methods, but also general shortcomings in how gene set analysis is currently conducted. We provide a directly executable benchmark system for straightforward assessment of additional enrichment methods.Availability&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpbioconductor.orgpackagesGSEABenchmarkeR&gt;httpbioconductor.orgpackagesGSEABenchmarkeR&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transcriptome Dynamics Reveals Progressive Transition from Effector to Memory in CD4&#43; T cells, bioRxiv, 2019-06-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractCD4&#43; T cells are repositories of immune memory, conferring enhanced immunity to many infectious agents. Studies of acute viral and bacterial infection suggest that memory CD4&#43; T cells develop directly from effectors. However, delineating these dynamic developmental pathways has been challenging. Here, we used high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq and temporal mixture modelling to examine the fate of Th1 and Tfh effector cells during non-lethal Plasmodium infection in mice. We observed linear Th1 and Tfh pathways towards memory, characterized by progressive halving in the numbers of genes expressed, and partial transcriptomic coalescence. Low-level persisting infection diverted but did not block these pathways. We observed in the Th1-pathway a linear transition from Th1 through a Tr1 state to TEM cells, which were then poised for Th1 re-call. The Tfh-pathway exhibited a modest Th1-signature throughout, with little evidence of Tr1 development, and co-expression of TCM and memory Tfh markers. Thus, we present a high-resolution atlas of transcriptome dynamics for naïve to memory transitions in CD4&#43; T cells. We also defined a subset of memory-associated genes, including transcription factors Id2 and Maf, whose expression increased progressively against the background of transcriptomic quiescence. Single-cell ATAC-seq revealed substantial heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility in single effectors, which was extensively, though incompletely reset and homogenized in memory. Our data reveal that linear transitions from effector to memory occur in a progressive manner over several weeks, suggesting opportunities for manipulating CD4&#43; T cell memory after primary infection.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;scRNA-seq reveals progressive transition from effector to memory in CD4&#43; T cells.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Transcriptome dynamics suggest linear not branching models for memory development.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;A subset of genes associates with gradual onset of CD4&#43; T cell memory.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Th1Tfh predisposition varies among clonotypes with identical antigen-specificity.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;scATAC-seq uncovers non-coding “memory” elements in the genome.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comprehensive ecosystem-specific 16S rRNA gene databases with automated taxonomy assignment (AutoTax) provide species-level resolution in microbial ecology, bioRxiv, 2019-06-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractHigh-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing is an indispensable method for studying the diversity and dynamics of microbial communities. However, this method is presently hampered by the lack of high-identity reference sequences for many environmental microbes in the public 16S rRNA gene reference databases, and by the lack of a systematic and comprehensive taxonomic classification for most environmental bacteria. Here we combine high-quality and high-throughput full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing with a novel sequence identity-based approach for automated taxonomy assignment (AutoTax) to create robust, near-complete 16S rRNA gene databases for complex environmental ecosystems. To demonstrate the benefit of the approach, we created an ecosystem-specific database for wastewater treatment systems and anaerobic digesters. The novel approach allows consistent species-level classification of 16S rRNA amplicons sequence variants (ASVs) and the design of highly specific oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization, which can reveal in situ properties of microbes at unprecedented taxonomic resolution.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modular and efficient pre-processing of single-cell RNA-seq, bioRxiv, 2019-06-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractAnalysis of single-cell RNA-seq data begins with the pre-processing of reads to generate count matrices. We investigate algorithm choices for the challenges of pre-processing, and describe a workflow that balances efficiency and accuracy. Our workflow is based on the kallisto and bustools programs, and is near-optimal in speed and memory. The workflow is modular, and we demonstrate its flexibility by showing how it can be used for RNA velocity analyses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probabilistic Models of Larval Zebrafish Behavior Structure on Many Scales, bioRxiv, 2019-06-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractNervous systems have evolved to combine environmental information with internal state to select and generate adaptive behavioral sequences. To better understand these computations and their implementation in neural circuits, natural behavior must be carefully measured and quantified. Here, we collect high spatial resolution video of single zebrafish larvae swimming in a naturalistic environment and develop models of their action selection across exploration and hunting. Zebrafish larvae swim in punctuated bouts separated by longer periods of rest called interbout intervals. We take advantage of this structure by categorizing bouts into discrete types and representing their behavior as labeled sequences of bout-types emitted over time. We then construct probabilistic models – specifically, marked renewal processes – to evaluate how bout-types and interbout intervals are selected by the fish as a function of its internal hunger state, behavioral history, and the locations and properties of nearby prey. Finally, we evaluate the models by their predictive likelihood and their ability to generate realistic trajectories of virtual fish swimming through simulated environments. Our simulations capture multiple timescales of structure in larval zebrafish behavior and expose many ways in which hunger state influences their action selection to promote food seeking during hunger and safety during satiety.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTBackgroundA growing body of literature suggests etiological overlap between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) and some cases of autism, although this relationship is poorly delineated. In addition, immune, autonomic, and endocrine dysregulation are reported in both conditions and may be relevant to their respective etiologies.AimsTo study symptom overlap in these two comorbid spectrum conditions.Methods and ProceduresWe surveyed 702 adults aged 25&#43; years on a variety of EDSHSD-related health topics, comparing individuals with EDSHSD, autism, and unaffected controls.Outcomes and ResultsThe autism group reported similar though less severe symptomology as the EDSHSD group, especially in areas of immuneautonomicendocrine dysregulation, connective tissue abnormalities (i.e., skin, bruisingbleeding), and chronic pain. EDSHSD mothers with autistic children reported more immune symptoms than EDSHSD mothers without, suggesting the maternal immune system could play a heritable role in these conditions (p = 0.0119).Conclusions and ImplicationsThese data suggest that EDSHSD and autism share aspects of immuneautonomicendocrine dysregulation, pain, and some tissue fragility, which is typically more severe in the former. This overlap, as well as documented comorbidity, suggests some forms of autism may be hereditary connective tissue disorders (HCTD).</p>
