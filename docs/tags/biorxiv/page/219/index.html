          <p>ABSTRACTWe recently developed novel AAV capsids for efficient and noninvasive gene transfer across the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this protocol, we describe how to produce and systemically administer AAV-PHP viruses to label andor genetically manipulate cells in the mouse nervous system and organs including the heart. The procedure comprises three separate stages AAV production, intravenous delivery, and evaluation of transgene expression. The protocol spans eight days, excluding the time required to assess gene expression, and can be readily adopted by laboratories with standard molecular and cell culture capabilities. We provide guidelines for experimental design and choosing the capsid, cargo, and viral dose appropriate for the experimental aims. The procedures outlined here are adaptable to diverse biomedical applications, from anatomical and functional mapping to gene expression, silencing, and editing.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing interest in studying the mammalian genome organization, it is still challenging to map the DNA contacts genome-wide. Here we present easy Hi-C (eHi-C), a highly efficient method for unbiased mapping of 3D genome architecture. The eHi-C protocol only involves a series of enzymatic reactions and maximizes the recovery of DNA products from proximity ligation. We show that eHi-C can be performed with 0.1 million cells and yields high quality libraries comparable to Hi-C.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A metaproteomics method to determine carbon sources and assimilation pathways of species in microbial communities, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractMeasurements of the carbon stable isotope ratio (δ13C) are widely used in biology to address major questions regarding food sources and metabolic pathways used by organisms. Measurement of these so called stable carbon isotope fingerprints (SIFs) for microbes involved in biogeochemical cycling and microbiota of plants and animals have led to major discoveries in environmental microbiology. Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide limited taxonomic resolution, such as with the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as NanoSIMS imaging of single cells.Here we present “direct Protein-SIF” and the Calis-p software package (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p&gt;httpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), which enable high-throughput measurements of accurate δ13C values for individual species within a microbial community. We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Using mock community samples, we show that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community. Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteria-animal symbiosis showed that direct Protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected new insights into the symbionts’ metabolism. This confirms the usefulness of this new approach to accurately determine δ13C values for different species in microbial community samples.&lt;jatssec id=s1&gt;SignificanceTo understand the roles that microorganisms play in diverse environments such as the open ocean and the human intestinal tract, we need an understanding of their metabolism and physiology. A variety of methods such as metagenomics and metaproteomics exist to assess the metabolism of environmental microorganisms based on gene content and gene expression. These methods often only provide indirect evidence for which substrates are used by a microorganism in a community. The direct Protein-SIF method that we developed allows linking microbial species in communities to the environmental carbon sources they consume by determining their stable carbon isotope signature. Direct Protein-SIF also allows assessing which carbon fixation pathway is used by autotrophic microorganisms that directly assimilate CO2.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Heterochromatin drives organization of conventional and inverted nuclei, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe mammalian cell nucleus displays a remarkable spatial segregation of active euchromatic from inactive heterochromatic genomic regions. In conventional nuclei, euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei, with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and may relate to the absence of particular proteins that tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic regions are central to phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, while interactions with the lamina are essential for building the conventional architecture from these segregated phases. Ultimately our data suggest that an inverted organization constitutes the default state of nuclear architecture.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Insect wings and body wall evolved from ancient leg segments, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the leg’s epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.One Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments</p>

          <p>Cannabis use is a heritable trait [1] that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes. To identify risk variants and improve our knowledge of the genetic etiology of cannabis use, we performed the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for lifetime cannabis use (N=184,765) to date. We identified 4 independent loci containing genome-wide significant SNP associations. Gene-based tests revealed 29 genome-wide significant genes located in these 4 loci and 8 additional regions. All SNPs combined explained 10% of the variance in lifetime cannabis use. The most significantly associated gene, CADM2, has previously been associated with substance use and risk-taking phenotypes [2–4]. We used S-PrediXcan to explore gene expression levels and found 11 unique eGenes. LD-score regression uncovered genetic correlations with smoking, alcohol use and mental health outcomes, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Mendelian randomisation analysis provided evidence for a causal positive influence of schizophrenia risk on lifetime cannabis use.</p>
