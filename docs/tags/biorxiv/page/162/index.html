          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics improves data denoising and pattern discovery, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies have shed light on the role of cellular diversity in human pathophysiology1–3, the resulting data remains noisy and sparse, making reliable quantification of gene expression challenging. Here, we show that a deep autoencoder coupled to a Bayesian model remarkably improves UMI-based scRNA-seq data quality by transfer learning across datasets. This new technology, SAVER-X, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The deep learning model in SAVER-X extracts transferable gene expression features across data from different labs, generated by varying technologies, and obtained from divergent species. Through this framework, we explore the limits of transfer learning in a diverse testbed and demonstrate that future human sequencing projects will unequivocally benefit from the accumulation of publicly available data. We further show, through examples in immunology and neurodevelopment, that SAVER-X can harness existing public data to enhance downstream analysis of new data, such as those collected in clinical settings.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Charting a tissue from single-cell transcriptomes, bioRxiv, 2018-10-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractMassively multiplexed sequencing of RNA in individual cells is transforming basic and clinical life sciences. However, in standard experiments, tissues must first be dissociated. Thus, after sequencing, information about the spatial relationships between cells is lost although this knowledge is crucial for understanding cellular and tissue-level function. Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We first show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efficiently. We apply our approach successfully to reconstruct the mammalian liver and intestinal epithelium as well as fly and zebrafish embryos. Our results demonstrate a simple spatial expression organization principle and that this principle (or future refined principles) can be used to infer, for individual cells, meaningful spatial position probabilities from the sequencing data alone.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic Consequences of Social Stratification in Great Britain, bioRxiv, 2018-10-30</h4>
          <p>Human DNA varies across geographic regions, with most variation observed so far reflecting distant ancestry differences. Here, we investigate the geographic clustering of genetic variants that influence complex traits and disease risk in a sample of ~450,000 individuals from Great Britain. Out of 30 traits analyzed, 16 show significant geographic clustering at the genetic level after controlling for ancestry, likely reflecting recent migration driven by socio-economic status (SES). Alleles associated with educational attainment (EA) show most clustering, with EA-decreasing alleles clustering in lower SES areas such as coal mining areas. Individuals that leave coal mining areas carry more EA-increasing alleles on average than the rest of Great Britain. In addition, we leveraged the geographic clustering of complex trait variation to further disentangle regional differences in socio-economic and cultural outcomes through genome-wide association studies on publicly available regional measures, namely coal mining, religiousness, 19702015 general election outcomes, and Brexit referendum results.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Retinotopic maps of visual space in the human cerebellum, bioRxiv, 2018-10-29</h4>
          <p>While the cerebellum is instrumental for motor control, it is not traditionally implicated in vision. Here, we report the existence of 5 ipsilateral visual field maps in the human cerebellum. These maps are located within the oculomotor vermis and cerebellar nodes of the dorsal attention and visual networks. These findings imply that the cerebellum is closely involved in visuospatial cognition, and that its contributions are anchored in sensory coordinates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Specialized and spatially organized coding of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables in midbrain dopamine neurons, bioRxiv, 2018-10-29</h4>
          <p>There is increased appreciation that dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain respond not only to reward 1,2 and reward-predicting cues 1,3,4, but also to other variables such as distance to reward 5, movements 6–11 and behavioral choices 12–15. Based on these findings, a major open question is how the responses to these diverse variables are organized across the population of DA neurons. In other words, do individual DA neurons multiplex multiple variables, or are subsets of neurons specialized in encoding specific behavioral variables? The reason that this fundamental question has been difficult to resolve is that recordings from large populations of individual DA neurons have not been performed in a behavioral task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we used 2-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record activity of &amp;gt;300 midbrain DA neurons in the VTA during a complex decision-making task. As mice navigated in a virtual reality (VR) environment, DA neurons encoded an array of sensory, motor, and cognitive variables. These responses were functionally clustered, such that subpopulations of neurons transmitted information about a subset of behavioral variables, in addition to encoding reward. These functional clusters were spatially organized, such that neighboring neurons were more likely to be part of the same cluster. Taken together with the topography between DA neurons and their projections, this specialization and anatomical organization may aid downstream circuits in correctly interpreting the wide range of signals transmitted by DA neurons.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The architecture of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes, bioRxiv, 2018-10-29</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYCollar cells are ancient animal cell types which are conserved across the animal kingdom [1] and their closest relatives, the choanoflagellates [2]. However, little is known about their ancestry, their subcellular architecture, or how they differentiate. The choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta [3] expresses genes necessary for animal multicellularity and development [4] and can alternate between unicellular and multicellular states [3,5], making it a powerful model to investigate the origin of animal multicellularity and mechanisms underlying cell differentiation [6,7]. To compare the subcellular architecture of solitary collar cells in S. rosetta with that of multicellular “rosettes” and collar cells in sponges, we reconstructed entire cells in 3D through transmission electron microscopy on serial ultrathin sections. Structural analysis of our 3D reconstructions revealed important differences between single and colonial choanoflagellate cells, with colonial cells exhibiting a more amoeboid morphology consistent with relatively high levels of macropinocytotic activity. Comparison of multiple reconstructed rosette colonies highlighted the variable nature of cell sizes, cell-cell contact networks and colony arrangement. Importantly, we uncovered the presence of elongated cells in some rosette colonies that likely represent a distinct and differentiated cell type. Intercellular bridges within choanoflagellate colonies displayed a variety of morphologies and connected some, but not all, neighbouring cells. Reconstruction of sponge choanocytes revealed both ultrastructural commonalities and differences in comparison to choanoflagellates. Choanocytes and colonial choanoflagellates are typified by high amoeboid cell activity. In both, the number of microvilli and volumetric proportion of the Golgi apparatus are comparable, whereas choanocytes devote less of their cell volume to the nucleus and mitochondria than choanoflagellates and more of their volume to food vacuoles. Together, our comparative reconstructions uncover the architecture of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes and constitute an important step in reconstructing the cell biology of the last common ancestor of the animal kingdom.</p>
