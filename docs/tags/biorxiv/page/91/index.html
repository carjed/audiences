          <p>AbstractDetailed functional analyses of many fundamentally-important plant genes via conventional loss-of-function approaches are impeded by severe pleiotropic phenotypes. In particular, mutations in genes that are required for basic cellular functions andor reproduction often interfere with the generation of homozygous mutant plants, precluding further functional studies. To overcome this limitation, we devised a CRISPR-based tissue-specific knockout system, CRISPR-TSKO, enabling the generation of somatic mutations in particular plant cell types, tissues, and organs. In Arabidopsis, CRISPR-TSKO mutations in essential genes caused well-defined, localized phenotypes in the root cap, stomatal lineage, or entire lateral roots. The underlying modular cloning system allows for efficient selection, identification, and functional analysis of mutant lines directly in the first transgenic generation. The efficacy of CRISPR-TSKO opens new avenues to discover and analyze gene functions in spatial and temporal contexts of plant life while avoiding pleiotropic effects of system-wide loss of gene function.</p>

          <p>1AbstractOffspring size is a fundamental trait in disparate biological fields of study. This trait can be measured as the size of plant seeds, animal eggs, or live young, and it influences ecological interactions, organism fitness, maternal investment, and embryonic development. Although multiple evolutionary processes have been predicted to drive the evolution of offspring size, the phylogenetic distribution of this trait remains poorly understood, due to the difficulty of reliably collecting and comparing offspring size data from many species. Here we present a database of 10,449 morphological descriptions of insect eggs, with records for 6,706 unique insect species and representatives from every extant hexapod order. The dataset includes eggs whose volumes span more than eight orders of magnitude. We created this database by partially automating the extraction of egg traits from the primary literature. In the process, we overcame challenges associated with large-scale phenotyping by designing and employing custom bioinformatic solutions to common problems. We matched the taxa in this database to the currently accepted scientific names in taxonomic and genetic databases, which will facilitate the use of this data for testing pressing evolutionary hypotheses in offspring size evolution.</p>

          <p>AbstractElaboration of Bayesian phylogenetic inference methods has continued at pace in recent years with major new advances in nearly all aspects of the joint modelling of evolutionary data. It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments.Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe a series of major new developments in the BEAST 2 core platform and model hierarchy that have occurred since the first release of the software, culminating in the recent 2.5 release.Author summaryBayesian phylogenetic inference methods have undergone considerable development in recent years, and joint modelling of rich evolutionary data, including genomes, phenotypes and fossil occurrences is increasingly common. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments. Developing scientific software is increasingly crucial to advancement in many fields of biology. The challenges range from practical software development and engineering, distributed team coordination, conceptual development and statistical modelling, to validation and testing. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform for phylogenetics, population genetics and phylodynamics, and was first announced over 4 years ago. Here we describe the full range of new tools and models available on the BEAST 2.5 platform, which expand joint evolutionary inference in many new directions, especially for joint inference over multiple data types, non-tree models and complex phylodynamics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep Neural Networks and Kernel Regression Achieve Comparable Accuracies for Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior and Demographics, bioRxiv, 2018-11-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is significant interest in the development and application of deep neural networks (DNNs) to neuroimaging data. A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distributed correlates of visually-guided behavior across the mouse brain, bioRxiv, 2018-11-20</h4>
          <p>Behavior arises from neuronal activity, but it is not known how the active neurons are distributed across brain regions and how their activity unfolds in time. Here, we used high-density Neuropixels probes to record from ~30,000 neurons in mice performing a visual contrast discrimination task. The task activated 60% of the neurons, involving nearly all 42 recorded brain regions, well beyond the regions activated by passive visual stimulation. However, neurons selective for choice (left vs. right) were rare, and found mostly in midbrain, striatum, and frontal cortex. Those in midbrain were typically activated prior to contralateral choices and suppressed prior to ipsilateral choices, consistent with a competitive midbrain circuit for adjudicating the subject’s choice. A brain-wide state shift distinguished trials in which visual stimuli led to movement. These results reveal concurrent representations of movement and choice in neurons widely distributed across the brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Factors associated with sharing email information and mental health survey participation in large population cohorts, bioRxiv, 2018-11-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractPeople who opt to participate in scientific studies tend to be healthier, wealthier, and more educated than the broader population. While selection bias does not always pose a problem for analysing the relationships between exposures and diseases or other outcomes, it can lead to biased effect size estimates. Biased estimates may weaken the utility of genetic findings because the goal is often to make inferences in a new sample (such as in polygenic risk score analysis). We used data from UK Biobank and Generation Scotland and conducted phenotypic and genome-wide association analyses on two phenotypes that reflected mental health data availability (1) whether participants were contactable by email for follow-up) and (2) whether participants responded to a follow-up surveys of mental health. We identified nine genetic loci associated with email contact and 25 loci associated with mental health survey completion. Both phenotypes were positively genetically correlated with higher educational attainment and better health and negatively genetically correlated with psychological distress and schizophrenia. Recontact availability and follow-up participation can act as further genetic filters for data on mental health phenotypes.</p>
