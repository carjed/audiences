          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transcriptome analysis in whole blood reveals increased microbial diversity in schizophrenia, bioRxiv, 2016-06-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe role of the human microbiome in health and disease is increasingly appreciated. We studied the composition of microbial communities present in blood across 192 individuals, including healthy controls and patients with three disorders affecting the brain schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and bipolar disorder. By using high quality unmapped RNA sequencing reads as candidate microbial reads, we performed profiling of microbial transcripts detected in whole blood. We were able to detect a wide range of bacterial and archaeal phyla in blood. Interestingly, we observed an increased microbial diversity in schizophrenia patients compared to the three other groups. We replicated this finding in an independent schizophrenia case-control cohort. This increased diversity is inversely correlated with estimated cell abundance of a subpopulation of CD8&#43; memory T cells in healthy controls, supporting a link between microbial products found in blood, immunity and schizophrenia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phased Diploid Genome Assembly with Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing, bioRxiv, 2016-06-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractWhile genome assembly projects have been successful in a number of haploid or inbred species, one of the current main challenges is assembling non-inbred or rearranged heterozygous genomes. To address this critical need, we introduce the open-source FALCON and FALCON-Unzip algorithms (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comPacificBiosciencesFALCON&gt;httpsgithub.comPacificBiosciencesFALCON&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) to assemble Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT®) Sequencing data into highly accurate, contiguous, and correctly phased diploid genomes. We demonstrate the quality of this approach by assembling new reference sequences for three heterozygous samples, including an F1 hybrid of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana, the widely cultivated V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, and the coral fungus Clavicorona pyxidata that have challenged short-read assembly approaches. The FALCON-based assemblies were substantially more contiguous and complete than alternate short or long-read approaches. The phased diploid assembly enabled the study of haplotype structures and heterozygosities between the homologous chromosomes, including identifying widespread heterozygous structural variations within the coding sequences.</p>

          <p>A key goal of developmental biology is to understand how a single cell transforms into a full-grown organism consisting of many cells. Although impressive progress has been made in lineage tracing using imaging approaches, analysis of vertebrate lineage trees has mostly been limited to relatively small subsets of cells. Here we present scartrace, a strategy for massively parallel clonal analysis based on Cas9 induced genetic scars in the zebrafish.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate prediction of single-cell DNA methylation states using deep learning, bioRxiv, 2016-05-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent technological advances have enabled assaying DNA methylation at single-cell resolution. Current protocols are limited by incomplete CpG coverage and hence methods to predict missing methylation states are critical to enable genome-wide analyses. Here, we report DeepCpG, a computational approach based on deep neural networks to predict DNA methylation states from DNA sequence and incomplete methylation profiles in single cells. We evaluated DeepCpG on single-cell methylation data from five cell types generated using alternative sequencing protocols, finding that DeepCpG yields substantially more accurate predictions than previous methods. Additionally, we show that the parameters of our model can be interpreted, thereby providing insights into the effect of sequence composition on methylation variability.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapidly evolving homing CRISPR barcodes, bioRxiv, 2016-05-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe present here an approach for engineering evolving DNA barcodes in living cells. The methodology entails using a homing guide RNA (hgRNA) scaffold that directs the Cas9-hgRNA complex to target the DNA locus of the hgRNA itself. We show that this homing CRISPR-Cas9 system acts as an expressed genetic barcode that diversifies its sequence and that the rate of diversification can be controlled in cultured cells. We further evaluate these barcodes in cultured cell populations and show that they can record lineage history and and that their RNA can be assayed as single molecules in situ. This integrated approach will have wide ranging applications, such as in deep lineage tracing, cellular barcoding, molecular recording, dissecting cancer biology, and connectome mapping.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?, bioRxiv, 2016-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.Author SummaryNeuroscience is held back by the fact that it is hard to evaluate if a conclusion is correct; the complexity of the systems under study and their experimental inaccessability make the assessment of algorithmic and data analytic technqiues challenging at best. We thus argue for testing approaches using known artifacts, where the correct interpretation is known. Here we present a microprocessor platform as one such test case. We find that many approaches in neuroscience, when used na•vely, fall short of producing a meaningful understanding.</p>
