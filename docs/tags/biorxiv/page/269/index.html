          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The population genomics of archaeological transition in west Iberia Investigation of ancient substructure using imputation and haplotype-based methods, bioRxiv, 2017-05-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe analyse new genomic data (0.05-2.95x) from 14 ancient individuals from Portugal distributed from the Middle Neolithic (4200-3500 BC) to the Middle Bronze Age (1740-1430 BC) and impute genomewide diploid genotypes in these together with published ancient Eurasians. While discontinuity is evident in the transition to agriculture across the region, sensitive haplotype-based analyses suggest a significant degree of local hunter-gatherer contribution to later Iberian Neolithic populations. A more subtle genetic influx is also apparent in the Bronze Age, detectable from analyses including haplotype sharing with both ancient and modern genomes, D-statistics and Y-chromosome lineages. However, the limited nature of this introgression contrasts with the major Steppe migration turnovers within third Millennium northern Europe and echoes the survival of non-Indo-European language in Iberia. Changes in genomic estimates of individual height across Europe are also associated with these major cultural transitions, and ancestral components continue to correlate with modern differences in stature.Author SummaryRecent ancient DNA work has demonstrated the significant genetic impact of mass migrations from the Steppe into Central and Northern Europe during the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. In Iberia, archaeological change at the level of material culture and funerary rituals has been reported during this period, however, the genetic impact associated with this cultural transformation has not yet been estimated. In order to investigate this, we sequence Neolithic and Bronze Age samples from Portugal, which we compare to other ancient and present-day individuals. Genome-wide imputation of a large dataset of ancient samples enabled sensitive methods for detecting population structure and selection in ancient samples. We revealed subtle genetic differentiation between the Portuguese Neolithic and Bronze Age samples suggesting a markedly reduced influx in Iberia compared to other European regions. Furthermore, we predict individual height in ancients, suggesting that stature was reduced in the Neolithic and affected by subsequent admixtures. Lastly, we examine signatures of strong selection in important traits and the timing of their origins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Human Cell Atlas, bioRxiv, 2017-05-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body, by undertaking a Human Cell Atlas Project as an international collaborative effort. The aim would be to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (e.g., gene expression) and connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (e.g., location and morphology). A comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, as well as provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Consequences of natural perturbations in the human plasma proteome, bioRxiv, 2017-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractProteins are the primary functional units of biology and the direct targets of most drugs, yet there is limited knowledge of the genetic factors determining inter-individual variation in protein levels. Here we reveal the genetic architecture of the human plasma proteome, testing 10.6 million DNA variants against levels of 2,994 proteins in 3,301 individuals. We identify 1,927 genetic associations with 1,478 proteins, a 4-fold increase on existing knowledge, including trans associations for 1,104 proteins. To understand consequences of perturbations in plasma protein levels, we introduce an approach that links naturally occurring genetic variation with biological, disease, and drug databases. We provide insights into pathogenesis by uncovering the molecular effects of disease-associated variants. We identify causal roles for protein biomarkers in disease through Mendelian randomization analysis. Our results reveal new drug targets, opportunities for matching existing drugs with new disease indications, and potential safety concerns for drugs under development.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tumor-infiltrating immune repertoires captured by single-cell barcoding in emulsion, bioRxiv, 2017-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractTumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are critical to anti-cancer immune responses, but their diverse phenotypes and functions remain poorly understood and challenging to study. We therefore developed a single-cell barcoding technology for deep characterization of TILs without the need for cell-sorting or culture. Our emulsion-based method captures full-length, natively paired B-cell and T-cell receptor (BCR and TCR) sequences from lymphocytes among millions of input cells. We validated the method with 3 million B-cells from healthy human blood and 350,000 B-cells from an HIV elite controller, before processing 400,000 cells from an unsorted dissociated ovarian adenocarcinoma and recovering paired BCRs and TCRs from over 11,000 TILs. We then extended the barcoding method to detect DNA-labeled antibodies, allowing ultra-high throughput, simultaneous protein detection and RNA sequencing from single cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep Neural Networks in Computational Neuroscience, bioRxiv, 2017-05-05</h4>
          <p>SummaryThe goal of computational neuroscience is to find mechanistic explanations of how the nervous system processes information to give rise to cognitive function and behaviour. At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses andor neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term “neural network” suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.</p>

          <p>1AbstractWe found tremendous inequality across gene and protein annotation resources. We observe that this bias leads biomedical researchers to focus on richly annotated genes instead of those with the strongest molecular data. We advocate for researchers to reduce these biases by pursuing data-driven hypotheses.</p>
