          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Astrocytes Contribute to Remote Memory Formation by Modulating Hippocampal-Cortical Communication During Learning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe consolidation and retrieval of remote memories depend on the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and frontal cortices. However, the exact time at which these regions are recruited to support memory and the interactions between them are still debated. Astrocytes can sense and modify neuronal activity with great precision, but their role in cognitive function has not been extensively explored. To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying remote memory involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating neuronal activity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DNA-loop extruding condensin complexes can traverse one another, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>Condensin, a key member of the Structure Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) protein complexes, has recently been shown to be a motor that extrudes loops of DNA1. It remains unclear, however, how condensin complexes work together to collectively package DNA into the chromosomal architecture. Here, we use time-lapse single-molecule visualization to study mutual interactions between two DNA-loop-extruding yeast condensins. We find that these one-side-pulling motor proteins are able to dynamically change each other’s DNA loop sizes, even when located large distances apart. When coming into close proximity upon forming a loop within a loop, condensin complexes are, surprisingly, able to traverse each other and form a new type of loop structure, which we term Z loop – three double-stranded DNA helices aligned in parallel with one condensin at each edge. These Z-loops can fill gaps left by single loops and can form symmetric dimer motors that reel in DNA from both sides. These new findings indicate that condensin may achieve chromosomal compaction using a variety of looping structures.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Increasing the efficiency of long-read sequencing for hybrid assembly with k-mer-based multiplexing, bioRxiv, 2019-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractHybrid genome assembly has emerged as an important technique in bacterial genomics, but cost and labor requirements limit large-scale application. We present Ultraplexing, a method to improve per-sample sequencing cost and hands-on-time of Nanopore sequencing for hybrid assembly by at least 50%, compared to molecular barcoding while maintaining high assembly quality (Quality Value; QV ≥ 42). Ultraplexing requires the availability of Illumina data and uses inter-sample genetic variability to assign reads to isolates, which obviates the need for molecular barcoding. Thus, Ultraplexing can enable significant sequencing and labor cost reductions in large-scale bacterial genome projects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Poor test-retest reliability of task-fMRI New empirical evidence and a meta-analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractIdentifying brain biomarkers of disease risk and treatment response is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is fundamentally limited by measurement reliability; measures that do not yield reliable values are unsuitable as biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments with 1,088 participants reporting 1,146 ICCs for task-fMRI revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC = .397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 commonly used fMRI tasks collected in the Human Connectome Project and the Dunedin Longitudinal Study were poor (ICCs = .067 - .485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that commonly used task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience (i.e., brain-behavior mapping). We review how this state of affairs came to be and consider several avenues for improving the reliability of task-fMRI.Significance StatementA biomarker with the potential to be useful in predicting clinical outcomes must yield values that are repeatable. We performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of the test-retest reliability of task-fMRI measures, which are widely adopted for biomarker discovery in neuroscience. We found that the meta-analytic reliability of task-fMRI was poor. We also investigated the reliability of many of the most commonly used task-fMRI measures in two datasets recently collected with cutting-edge scanners and methods. We found generally poor reliability for these task-fMRI measures. These findings indicate that many task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for biomarker discovery or individual differences research in cognitive neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A receptor for herbivore-associated molecular patterns mediates plant immunity, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractPlant-herbivore interactions are ubiquitous across nature and drive major agricultural losses. Inducible defense responses triggered through immune recognition aid in host plant protection; however, specific ligand-receptor pairs mediating the initial perception of herbivory remain unknown. Plants in the subtribe Phaseolinae detect herbivore-associated peptides in caterpillar oral secretions and the defined ligands are proteolytic fragments of chloroplastic ATP synthase termed inceptins. Using forward genetic mapping of inceptin-induced responses, we identify a cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein as an inceptin receptor (INR) sufficient for elicitor-induced responses and enhanced defense against armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). INR defines a receptor by which plants perceive herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and expands the paradigm of surface immune recognition to attack with mandibles.One Sentence SummaryA plant cell surface receptor directly perceives peptides associated with caterpillar herbivory.</p>

          <p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory entails brain-wide switching between activity states. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Schizophrenia patients show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations.</p>
