          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The gut microbiota influences how circulating immune cells in humans change from one day to the next, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe gut microbiota influences the development and homeostasis of the mammalian immune system1–3, can alter immune cell compositions in mice4–7, and is associated with responses to immunotherapy that rely on the activity of peripheral immune cells8–12. Still, our understanding of how the microbiota modulates circulatory immune cells remains limited, particularly in humans where a lack of manipulative experiments makes inference challenging. Here we overcome this challenge by studying hundreds of hospitalized—and closely monitored—bone marrow transplantation patients as they recover from chemotherapy-induced immune ablation. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both circulatory immune cell and microbiota populations, allowing the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously over time with unprecedented resolution. We analyzed daily changes in white blood cell counts from 2,235 patients, and 10,680 longitudinal fecal microbiota samples to identify bacterial genera consistently associated with those changes. Bayesian inference and validation across different patient cohorts revealed consistent associations between intestinal bacteria and peripheral immune cell dynamics in the context of immunomodulatory medications, clinical metadata and homeostatic feedbacks between peripheral immune cells. The quantification of validated microbiota associations enabled us to contrast the potency of fermentatively active, obligate anaerobic bacteria with that of medications with known immunomodulatory mechanism, and this way estimate the microbiota potential to alter peripheral immune cell dynamics directly in patients. Our analysis establishes and quantifies the link between the intestinal microbiota and immune cell dynamics in humans, with implications for microbiota-driven modulation of immunity and immunotherapies that rely on circulatory immune cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population imaging of neural activity in awake behaving mice in multiple brain regions, bioRxiv, 2019-04-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractA longstanding goal in neuroscience has been to image membrane voltage, with high temporal precision and sensitivity, in awake behaving mammals. Here, we report a genetically encoded voltage indicator, SomArchon, which exhibits millisecond response times and compatibility with optogenetic control, and which increases the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and number of neurons observable, by manyfold over previous reagents. SomArchon only requires conventional one-photon microscopy to achieve these high performance characteristics. These improvements enable population analysis of neural activity, both at the subthreshold and spiking levels, in multiple brain regions – cortex, hippocampus, and striatum – of awake behaving mice. Using SomArchon, we detect both positive and negative responses of striatal neurons during movement, highlighting the power of voltage imaging to reveal bidirectional modulation. We also examine how the intracellular subthreshold theta oscillations of hippocampal neurons govern spike output, finding that nearby cells can exhibit highly correlated subthreshold activities, even as they generate highly divergent spiking patterns.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The MADS-box transcription factor PHERES1 controls imprinting in the endosperm by binding to domesticated transposons, bioRxiv, 2019-04-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractMADS-box transcription factors are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms and play major roles during plant development. Nevertheless, their function in seed development remains largely unknown. Here we show that the imprinted Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-box TF PHERES1 (PHE1) is a master regulator of paternally expressed imprinted genes, as well as of non-imprinted key regulators of endosperm development. PHE1 binding sites show distinct epigenetic modifications on maternal and paternal alleles, correlating with parental-specific transcriptional activity. Importantly, we show that the CArG-box-like DNA-binding motifs bound by PHE1 have been distributed by RCHelitron transposable elements. Our data provide an example of molecular domestication of these elements, which by distributing PHE1 binding sites throughout the genome, have facilitated the recruitment of crucial endosperm regulators into a single transcriptional network.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Animal, fungi, and plant genome sequences harbour different non-canonical splice sites, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractMost protein encoding genes in eukaryotes contain introns which are inter-woven with exons. After transcription, introns need to be removed in order to generate the final mRNA which can be translated into an amino acid sequence by the ribosome. Precise excision of introns by the spliceosome requires conserved dinucleotides which mark the splice sites. However, there are variations of the highly conserved combination of GT at the 5’ end and AG at the 3’ end of an intron in the genome. GC-AG and AT-AC are two major non-canonical splice site combinations which are known for many years. During the last few years, various minor non-canonical splice site combinations were detected with all possible dinucleotide permutations. Here we expand systematic investigations of non-canonical splice site combinations in plant genomes to all eukaryotes by analysing fungal and animal genome sequences. Comparisons of splice site combinations between these three kingdoms revealed several differences such as a substantially increased CT-AC frequency in fungal genomes. In addition, high numbers of GA-AG splice site combinations were observed in two animal species. In depth investigation of splice site usage based on RNA-Seq read mappings indicates a generally higher flexibility of the 3’ splice site compared to the 5’ splice site.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Excess significance bias in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation literature for neuropsychiatric disorders, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIntroductionRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely tested and promoted for use in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, but as for many other medical devices, some gaps may exist in the literature and the evidence base for rTMS clinical efficacy remains under debate. We aimed to empirically test for an excess number of statistically significant results in the literature on rTMS therapeutic efficacy across a wide range of meta-analyses and to characterize the power of studies included in these meta-analyses.MethodsBased on power calculations, we computed the expected number of “positive” datasets for a medium effect-size (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.30) and compared it with the number of observed “positive” datasets. Sensitivity analyses considered small (SMD=0.20), modest (SMD=0.50), and large (SMD=0.80) effect sizes.Results14 meta-analyses with 228 datasets (110 for neurological disorders and 118 for psychiatric disorders) were assessed. For SMD=0.3, the number of observed “positive” studies (n=94) was larger than expected (n=35). We found evidence for an excess of significant findings overall (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and in 814 meta-analyses. Evidence for an excess of significant findings was also observed for SMD=0.5 for neurological disorders. 0 (0 %), 0 (0 %), 3 (1 %), and 53 (23 %) of the 228 datasets had power &amp;gt;0.80, respectively for SMDs of 0.30, 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80.ConclusionMost studies in the rTMS literature are underpowered. This results in fragmentation and waste of research efforts. The somewhat high frequency of “positive” results seems spurious and may reflect bias.Trial Registration PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017056694</p>

          <p>AbstractModelTest-NG is a re-implementation from scratch of jModelTest and ProtTest, two popular tools for selecting the best-fit nucleotide and amino acid substitution models, respectively. ModelTest-NG is one to two orders of magnitude faster than jModelTest and ProtTest but equally accurate, and introduces several new features, such as ascertainment bias correction, mixture and FreeRate models, or the automatic processing of partitioned datasets.
