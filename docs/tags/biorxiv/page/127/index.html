          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia, bioRxiv, 2018-03-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe genetic formation of Central and South Asian populations has been unclear because of an absence of ancient DNA. To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia—consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC—and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.One Sentence SummaryGenome wide ancient DNA from 357 individuals from Central and South Asia sheds new light on the spread of Indo-European languages and parallels between the genetic history of two sub-continents, Europe and South Asia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale neuroimaging and genetic study reveals genetic architecture of brain white matter microstructure, bioRxiv, 2018-03-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractMicrostructural changes of white matter (WM) tracts are known to be associated with various neuropsychiatric disordersdiseases. Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n ∼ 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Recovering signals of ghost archaic admixture in the genomes of present-day Africans, bioRxiv, 2018-03-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractAnalyses of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes have characterized multiple interbreeding events between archaic and modern human populations. While several studies have suggested the presence of deeply diverged lineages in present-day African populations, we lack methods to precisely characterize these introgression events without access to reference archaic genomes. We present a novel reference-free method that combines diverse population genetic summary statistics to identify segments of archaic ancestry in present-day individuals. Using this method, we find that 7.97 ±0.6% of the genetic ancestry from the West African Yoruba population traces its origin to an unidentified, archaic population (FDR ≤20%). We find several loci that harbor archaic ancestry at elevated frequencies and that the archaic ancestry in the Yoruba is reduced near selectively constrained regions of the genome suggesting that archaic admixture has had a systematic impact on the fitness of modern human populations both within and outside of Africa.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exploring the Impact of Analysis Software on Task fMRI Results, bioRxiv, 2018-03-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractA wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this ‘methodological plurality’ comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software packages, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. Neuroimaging is currently experiencing a surge in initiatives to improve research practices and ensure that all conclusions inferred from an fMRI study are replicable.In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publically shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyze, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 - 0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our own efforts to make this research reproducible.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Widespread transcriptional scanning in the testis modulates gene evolution rates, bioRxiv, 2018-03-14</h4>
          <p>The testis expresses the largest number of genes of any mammalian organ, a finding that has long puzzled molecular biologists. Analyzing our single-cell transcriptomic maps of human and mouse spermatogenesis, we provide evidence that this widespread transcription serves to maintain DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through &#39;transcriptional scanning&#39;. Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary time-scales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning modulates germline mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for fast evolution in a specific subset.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Efficient expression of genes in the Drosophila germline using a UAS-promoter free of interference by Hsp70 piRNAs, bioRxiv, 2018-03-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTControlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years. However, most existing GAL4 expression constructs only function effectively in somatic cells, but not in germ cells during oogenesis, for unknown reasons. A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis. By reducing Hsp70 sequences targeted by piRNAs, we created UASz, which functions better than UASp in the germline and like UASt in somatic cells.</p>
