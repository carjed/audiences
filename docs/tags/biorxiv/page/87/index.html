          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tunability of DNA polymerase stability during eukaryotic DNA replication, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>SummaryStructural and biochemical studies have revealed the basic principles of how the replisome duplicates genomic DNA, but little is known about its dynamics during DNA replication. We reconstitute the 34 proteins needed to form the S. cerevisiae replisome and show how changing local concentrations of the key DNA polymerases tunes the ability of the complex to efficiently recycle these proteins or to dynamically exchange them. Particularly, we demonstrate redundancy of the Pol α DNA polymerase activity in replication and show that Pol α primase and the lagging-strand Pol δ can be re-used within the replisome to support the synthesis of large numbers of Okazaki fragments. This unexpected malleability of the replisome might allow it to deal with barriers and resource challenges during replication of large genomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Whole genome phylogenies reflect long-tailed distributions of recombination rates in many bacterial species, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlthough homologous recombination is accepted to be common in bacteria, so far it has been challenging to accurately quantify its impact on genome evolution within bacterial species. We here introduce methods that use the statistics of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) splits in the core genome alignment of a set of strains to show that, for many bacterial species, recombination dominates genome evolution. Each genomic locus has been overwritten so many times by recombination that it is impossible to reconstruct the clonal phylogeny and, instead of a consensus phylogeny, the phylogeny typically changes many thousands of times along the core genome alignment.We also show how SNP splits can be used to quantify the relative rates with which different subsets of strains have recombined in the past. We find that virtually every strain has a unique pattern of recombination frequencies with other strains and that the relative rates with which different subsets of strains share SNPs follow long-tailed distributions. Our findings show that bacterial populations are neither clonal nor freely recombining, but structured such that recombination rates between different lineages vary along a continuum spanning several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage. Thus, rather than reflecting clonal ancestry, whole genome phylogenies reflect these long-tailed distributions of recombination rates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pooled-parent exome sequencing to prioritise de novo variants in genetic disease, bioRxiv, 2019-04-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the clinical setting, exome sequencing has become standard-of-care in diagnosing rare genetic disorders, however many patients remain unsolved. Trio sequencing has been demonstrated to produce a higher diagnostic yield than singleton (proband-only) sequencing. Parental sequencing is especially useful when a disease is suspected to be caused by a de novo variant in the proband, because parental data provide a strong filter for the majority of variants that are shared by the proband and their parents. However the additional cost of sequencing the parents makes the trio strategy uneconomical for many clinical situations. With two thirds of the sequencing budget being spent on parents, these are funds that could be used to sequence more probands. For this reason many clinics are reluctant to sequence parents.Here we propose a pooled-parent strategy for exome sequencing of individuals with likely de novo disease. In this strategy, DNA from all the parents of a cohort of unrelated probands is pooled together into a single exome capture and sequencing run. Variants called in the proband can then be filtered if they are also found in the parent pool, resulting in a shorter list of prioritised variants. To evaluate the pooled-parent strategy we performed a series of simulations by combining reads from individual exomes to imitate sample pooling. We assessed the recall and false positive rate and investigated the trade-off between pool size and recall rate. We compared the performance of GATK HaplotypeCaller individual and joint calling, and FreeBayes to genotype pooled samples. Finally, we applied a pooled-parent strategy to a set of real unsolved cases and showed that the parent pool is a powerful filter that is complementary to other commonly used variant filters such as population variant frequencies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring shared responses across subjects using intersubject correlation, bioRxiv, 2019-04-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractOur capacity to jointly represent information about the world underpins our social experience. By leveraging one individual’s brain activity to model another’s, we can measure shared information across brains—even in dynamic, naturalistic scenarios where an explicit response model may be unobtainable. Introducing experimental manipulations allows us to measure, for example, shared responses between speakers and listeners, or between perception and recall. In this tutorial, we develop the logic of intersubject correlation (ISC) analysis and discuss the family of neuroscientific questions that stem from this approach. We also extend this logic to spatially distributed response patterns and functional network estimation. We provide a thorough and accessible treatment of methodological considerations specific to ISC analysis, and outline best practices.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic Associations with Mathematics Tracking and Persistence in Secondary School, bioRxiv, 2019-04-05</h4>
          <p>Maximizing the flow of students through the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) pipeline is important to promoting human capital development and reducing economic inequality1. A critical juncture in the STEM pipeline is the highly-cumulative sequence of secondary school math courses2–5. Students from disadvantaged schools are less likely to complete advanced math courses, but debate continues about why6,7. Here, we address this question using student polygenic scores, which are DNA-based indicators of propensity to succeed in education8. We integrated genetic and official school transcript data from over 3,000 European-ancestry students from U.S. high schools. We used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools. Students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math for more years. Molecular tracer analyses revealed that the dynamics of the math pipeline differed by school advantage. Compared to disadvantaged schools, advantaged schools tracked more students with high polygenic scores into advanced math classes at the start of high school, and they buffered students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. Across all schools, even students with exceptional polygenic scores (top 2%) were unlikely to take the most advanced math classes, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the development of potential STEM talent. These results link new molecular genetic discoveries to a common target of educational-policy reforms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Geosmin attracts Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to oviposition sites, bioRxiv, 2019-04-05</h4>
          <p>Geosmin is one of the most recognizable and common microbial smells on the planet. Some insects, like mosquitoes, require microbial-rich environments for their progeny, whereas for other insects such microbes may prove dangerous. In the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, geosmin is decoded in a remarkably precise fashion and induces aversion, presumably signaling the presence of harmful microbes. We have here investigated the effect of geosmin on the behavior of the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti. In contrast to flies, geosmin is not aversive in mosquitoes but stimulates egg-laying site selection. Female mosquitoes could associate geosmin with microbes, including cyanobacteria consumed by larvae, who also find geosmin – as well as geosmin producing cyanobacteria – attractive. Using in vivo multiphoton imaging from mosquitoes with pan-neural expression of the calcium reporter GCaMP6s, we show that Ae. aegypti code geosmin in a similar fashion to flies, i.e. with extreme sensitivity and with a high degree of selectivity. We further demonstrate that geosmin can be used as bait under field conditions, and finally we show that geosmin, which is both expensive and difficult to obtain, can be substituted by beetroot peel extract, providing a cheap and viable mean of mosquito control and surveillance in developing countries.</p>
