          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">On-site ribosome remodeling by locally synthesized ribosomal proteins in axons, bioRxiv, 2018-12-20</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYRibosomes are known to be assembled in the nucleolus, yet recent studies have revealed robust enrichment and translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axons, far away from neuronal cell bodies. Using subcellular proteomics and live-imaging, we show that locally synthesized RPs incorporate into axonal ribosomes in a nucleolus-independent fashion. We revealed that axonal RP translation is regulated through a novel sequence motif, CUIC, that forms a RNA-loop structure in the region immediately upstream of the initiation codon. Inhibition of axonal CUIC-regulated RP translation leads to defects in local translation activity and axon branching, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the axonal ribosome remodeling. These results indicate that axonal translation supplies cytoplasmic RPs to maintainmodify local ribosomal function far from the nucleolus.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Prioritisation of oncology therapeutic targets using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, bioRxiv, 2018-12-20</h4>
          <p>SummaryFunctional genomics approaches can overcome current limitations that hamper oncology drug development such as lack of robust target identification and clinical efficacy. Here we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 204 human cancer cell lines from 12 cancer-types and developed a data-driven framework to prioritise cancer therapeutic candidates. We integrated gene cell fitness effects with genomic biomarkers and target tractability for drug development to systematically prioritise new oncology targets in defined tissues and genotypes. Furthermore, we took one of our most promising dependencies, Werner syndrome RecQ helicase, and verified it as a candidate target for tumours with microsatellite instability. Our analysis provides a comprehensive resource of cancer dependencies, a framework to prioritise oncology targets, and nominates specific new candidates. The principles described in this study can transform the initial stages of the drug development process contributing to a new, diverse and more effective portfolio of oncology targets.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Precision Medicine Advancements Using Whole Genome Sequencing, Noninvasive Whole Body Imaging, and Functional Diagnostics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWe report the results of a three-year precision medicine study that enrolled 1190 presumed healthy participants at a single research clinic. To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imagingangiography (MRIMRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score &amp;gt; 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRIMRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Self-repair protects microtubules from their destruction by molecular motors, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18</h4>
          <p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers that are used for intracellular transport and chromosome segregation during cell division. Their instability stems from the low energy of tubulin dimer interactions, which sets the growing polymer close to its disassembly conditions. Microtubules function in coordination with kinesin and dynein molecular motors, which use ATP hydrolysis to produce mechanical work and move on microtubules. This raises the possibility that the forces produced by walking motors can break dimer interactions and trigger microtubule disassembly. We tested this hypothesis by studying the interplay between microtubules and moving molecular motors in vitro. Our results show that the mechanical work of molecular motors can remove tubulin dimers from the lattice and rapidly destroy microtubules. This effect was not observed when free tubulin dimers were present in the assay. Using fluorescently labelled tubulin dimers we found that dimer removal by motors was compensated for by the insertion of free tubulin dimers into the microtubule lattice. This self-repair mechanism allows microtubules to survive the damage induced by molecular motors as they move along their tracks. Our study reveals the existence of coupling between the motion of kinesin and dynein motors and the renewal of the microtubule lattice.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Endogenous variation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex state dynamics during naturalistic viewing reflects affective experience, bioRxiv, 2018-12-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHow we process ongoing experiences is shaped by our personal history, current needs, and future goals. Consequently, brain regions involved in generating these subjective appraisals, such as the vmPFC, often appear to be heterogeneous across individuals even in response to the same external information. To elucidate the role of the vmPFC in processing our ongoing experiences, we developed a computational framework and analysis pipeline to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual vmPFC responses as participants viewed a 45-minute television drama. Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences. Although these transitions typically occur at idiosyncratic times across people, participants exhibited a marked increase in state alignment during high affectively valenced events in the show. Our work suggests that the vmPFC ascribes affective meaning to our ongoing experiences.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Case For and Against Double-blind Reviews, bioRxiv, 2018-12-16</h4>
          <p>To date, the majority of authors on scientific publications have been men. While much of this gender bias can be explained by historic sexism and discrimination, there is concern that women may still be disadvantaged by the peer review process if reviewers&#39; unconscious biases lead them to reject publications with female authors more often. One potential solution to this perceived gender bias in the reviewing process is for journals to adopt double-blind reviews whereby neither the authors nor the reviewers are aware of each other&#39;s identities and genders. To test the efficacy of double-blind reviews, we assigned gender to every authorship of every paper published in 5 different journals with different peer review processes (double-blind vs. single blind) and subject matter (birds vs. behavioral ecology) from 2010-2018 (n = 4865 papers). While female authorships comprised only 35% of the total, the double-blind journal Behavioral Ecology did not have more female authorships than its single-blind counterparts. Interestingly, the incidence of female authorship is higher at behavioral ecology journals (Behavioral Ecology and Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) than in the ornithology journals (Auk, Condor, Ibis), for papers on all topics as well as those on birds. These analyses suggest that double-blind review does not currently increase the incidence of female authorship in the journals studied here. We conclude, at least for these journals, that double-blind review does not benefit female authors and may, in the long run, be detrimental.</p>
