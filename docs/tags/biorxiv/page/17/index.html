          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The frequency gradient of human resting-state brain oscillations follows cortical hierarchies, bioRxiv, 2019-11-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe human cortex is characterized by local morphological features such as cortical thickness, myelin content and gene expression that change along the posterior-anterior axis. We investigated if these structural gradients are associated with a similar gradient in a prominent feature of brain activity – namely the frequency of brain oscillations. In resting-state MEG recordings from healthy participants (N=187), we found that the strongest peak frequency in a brain area decreases significantly, gradually and robustly along the posterior-anterior axis following the global hierarchy from early sensory to higher-order areas. This spatial gradient of peak frequency was significantly anticorrelated with the cortical thickness of corresponding areas representing a proxy of the cortical hierarchical level. This result indicates that the intrinsic ‘resonance’ frequency decreases systematically from early sensory to higher-order areas and establishes a new structure-function relationship pertaining to brain oscillations as a core organizational principle that may underlie hierarchical specialization in the brain.</p>

          <p>AbstractMicrotubules and filamentous (F-) actin engage in complex interactions to drive many cellular processes from subcellular organisation to cell division and migration. This is thought to be largely controlled by proteins that interface between the two structurally distinct cytoskeletal components. Here, we use cryo-electron tomography to demonstrate that the microtubule lumen can be occupied by extended segments of F-actin in small-molecule induced, microtubule-based cellular projections. We uncover an unexpected versatility in cytoskeletal form that may prompt a significant development of our current models of cellular architecture and offer a new experimental approach for the in-situ study of microtubule structure and contents.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">SparK A Publication-quality NGS Visualization Tool, bioRxiv, 2019-11-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractWhile there are sophisticated resources available for displaying NGS data, including the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) and the UCSC genome browser, exporting regions and assembling figures for publication remains challenging. In particular, customizing track appearance and overlaying track replicates is a manual and time-consuming process. Here, we present SparK, a tool which auto-generates publication-ready, high-resolution, true vector graphic figures from any NGS-based tracks, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq. Novel functions of SparK include averaging of replicates, plotting standard deviation tracks, and highlighting significantly changed areas. SparK is written in Python 3, making it executable on any major OS platform. Using command line prompts to generate figures allows later changes to be made very easy. For instance, if the genomic region of the plot needs to be changed, or tracks need to be added or removed, the figure can easily be re-generated within seconds without the manual process of re-exporting and re-assembling everything. After plotting with SparK, changes to the output SVG vector graphic files are simple to make, including text, lines, and colors. SparK is publicly available on GitHub &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comharbourlabSparK&gt;httpsgithub.comharbourlabSparK&lt;jatsext-link&gt;.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Variability in the analysis of a single neuroimaging dataset by many teams, bioRxiv, 2019-11-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryData analysis workflows in many scientific domains have become increasingly complex and flexible. To assess the impact of this flexibility on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, the same dataset was independently analyzed by 70 teams, testing nine ex-ante hypotheses. The flexibility of analytic approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyze the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in hypothesis test results, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of their analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Importantly, meta-analytic approaches that aggregated information across teams yielded significant consensus in activated regions across teams. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset. Our findings show that analytic flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and demonstrate factors related to variability in fMRI. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomics of a complete butterfly continent, bioRxiv, 2019-11-05</h4>
          <p>Never before have we had the luxury of choosing a continent, picking a large phylogenetic group of animals, and obtaining genomic data for its every species. Here, we sequence all 845 species of butterflies recorded from North America north of Mexico. Our comprehensive approach reveals the pattern of diversification and adaptation occurring in this phylogenetic lineage as it has spread over the continent, which cannot be seen on a sample of selected species. We observe bursts of diversification that generated taxonomic ranks subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, and species. The older burst around 70 Mya resulted in the butterfly subfamilies, with the major evolutionary inventions being unique phenotypic traits shaped by high positive selection and gene duplications. The recent burst around 5 Mya is caused by explosive radiation in diverse butterfly groups associated with diversification in transcription and mRNA regulation, morphogenesis, and mate selection. Rapid radiation correlates with more frequent introgression of speciation-promoting and beneficial genes among radiating species. Radiation and extinction patterns over the last 100 million years suggest the following general model of animal evolution. A population spreads over the land, adapts to various conditions through mutations, and diversifies into several species. Occasional hybridization between these species results in accumulation of beneficial alleles in one, which eventually survives, while others become extinct. Not only butterflies, but also the hominids may have followed this path.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quantitative translation of dog-to-human aging by conserved remodeling of epigenetic networks, bioRxiv, 2019-11-04</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYMammals progress through similar physiological stages during life, from early development to puberty, aging, and death. Yet, the extent to which this conserved physiology reflects conserved molecular events is unclear. Here, we map common epigenetic changes experienced by mammalian genomes as they age, focusing on evolutionary comparisons of humans to dogs, an emerging model of aging. Using targeted sequencing, we characterize the methylomes of 104 Labrador retrievers spanning a 16 year age range, achieving &amp;gt;150X coverage within mammalian syntenic blocks. Comparison with human methylomes reveals a nonlinear relationship which translates dog to human years, aligns the timing of major physiological milestones between the two species, and extends to mice. Conserved changes center on specific developmental gene networks which are sufficient to capture the effects of anti-aging interventions in multiple mammals. These results establish methylation not only as a diagnostic age readout but as a cross-species translator of physiological aging milestones.</p>
