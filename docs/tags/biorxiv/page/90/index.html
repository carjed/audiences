          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Climate or disturbance temperate forest structural change and carbon sink potential, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTAnticipating forest responses to changing climate and disturbance regimes requires understanding long-term successional processes and aggregating these local processes into global relevance. Estimates of existing forest structure and biomass are improving globally; however, vegetation models continue to show substantial spread in predictions of future land carbon uptake and the roles of forest structural change and demography are increasingly being recognized as important. To identify mechanisms that drive change in tree size, density, and carbon, we need a better understanding of forest structural trajectories and the factors that affect those trajectories. Here we reveal a coherent, cyclic pattern of structural change in temperate forests, as predicted by successional theory, and identify significant sensitivity to climatic precipitation and temperature anomalies using large datasets and empirical modeling. For example, in the eastern US above average temperature (&#43;1°C) was associated with a 27% (−0.4±0.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) reduction in productivity attributed to higher rates of disease (&#43;23%), weather disturbance (&#43;57%), and sapling mortality. Projections of future vegetative carbon sink potential suggests biomass would be lowest on managed lands (72±2 Mg C ha-1) and highest when larger trees survive in undisturbed conditions (153±21 Mg C ha-1). Overall, the indirect effects of disturbance and mortality were considerably larger than the direct effects of climate on productivity when predicting future vegetative carbon sinks. Results provide robust comparisons for global vegetation models, and valuable projections for management and carbon mitigation efforts.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Naught all zeros in sequence count data are the same, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractDue to the advent and utility of high-throughput sequencing, modern biomedical research abounds with multivariate count data. Yet such sequence count data is often extremely sparse; that is, much of the data is zero values. Such zero values are well known to cause problems for statistical analyses. In this work we provide a systematic description of different processes that can give rise to zero values as well as the types of methods for addressing zeros in sequence count studies. Importantly, we systematically review how various models perform on each type of zero generating process. Our results demonstrate that zero-inflated models can have substantial biases in both simulated and real data settings. Additionally, we find that zeros due to biological absences can, for many applications, be approximated as originating from under sampling. Beyond these results, this work provides a paired categorization scheme for models and zero generating processes to facilitate discussions and future research into the analysis of sequence count data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quantitative PCR provides a simple and accessible method for quantitative microbiome profiling, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe use of relative next generation sequencing (NGS) abundance data can lead to misinterpretations of microbial community structures as the increase of one taxon leads to concurrent decrease of the other(s). To overcome compositionality, we provide a quantitative NGS solution, which is achieved by adjusting the relative 16S rRNA gene amplicon NGS data with quantitative PCR (qPCR-based) total bacterial counts. By comparing the enumeration of dominant bacterial groups on different taxonomic levels in human fecal samples using taxon-specific 16S rRNA gene-targeted qPCR we show that quantitative NGS is able to estimate absolute bacterial abundances accurately. We also observed a higher degree of correspondence in the estimated microbe-metabolite relationship when quantitative NGS was applied. Being conceptually and methodologically analogous to amplicon-based NGS, our qPCR-based method can be readily incorporated into the standard, high-throughput NGS sample processing pipeline for more accurate description of interactions within and between the microbes and host.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comparative assessment of long-read error-correction software applied to RNA-sequencing data, bioRxiv, 2018-11-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractMotivationLong-read sequencing technologies offer promising alternatives to high-throughput short read sequencing, especially in the context of RNA-sequencing. However these technologies are currently hindered by high error rates in the output data that affect analyses such as the identification of isoforms, exon boundaries, open reading frames, and the creation of gene catalogues. Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error-correction of RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.ResultsIn this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error-correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias towards the major isoform, and splice site detection. We find that long read error-correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base-pair accuracy. Yet investigators should be warned that the correction process perturbs gene family sizes and isoform diversity. This work provides guidelines on which (or whether) error-correction tools should be used, depending on the application type.Benchmarking software&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgitlab.comleoislLR_EC_analyser&gt;httpsgitlab.comleoislLR_EC_analyser&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">C. elegans pathogenic learning confers multigenerational pathogen avoidance, bioRxiv, 2018-11-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe ability to pass on learned information to progeny could present an evolutionary advantage for many generations. While apparently evolutionarily conserved1–12, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is not well understood at the molecular or behavioral levels. Here we describe our discovery that C. elegans can pass on a learned pathogenic avoidance behavior to their progeny for several generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Although worms are initially attracted to the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (PA14)13, they can learn to avoid this pathogen13. We found that prolonged PA14 exposure results in transmission of avoidance behavior to progeny that have themselves never been exposed to PA14, and this behavior persists through the fourth generation. This form of transgenerational inheritance of bacterial avoidance is specific to pathogenic P. aeruginosa, requires physical contact and infection, and is distinct from CREB-dependent long-term associative memory and larval imprinting. The TGF-β ligand daf-7, whose expression increases in the ASJ upon initial exposure to PA1414, is highly expressed in the ASI neurons of progeny of trained mothers until the fourth generation, correlating with transgenerational avoidance behavior. Mutants of histone modifiers and small RNA mediators display defects in naïve PA14 attraction and aversive learning. By contrast, the germline-expressed PRG-1Piwi homolog15 is specifically required for transgenerational inheritance of avoidance behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel and natural paradigm of TEI that may optimize progeny decisions and subsequent survival in the face of changing environmental conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Hunger for Knowledge How the Irresistible Lure of Curiosity is Generated in the Brain, bioRxiv, 2018-11-22</h4>
          <p>Introductory ParagraphCuriosity is often portrayed as a desirable feature of human faculty. For example, a meta-analysis revealed that curiosity predicts academic performance above and beyond intelligence1, corroborating findings that curiosity supported long-term consolidation of learning2,3. However, curiosity may come at a cost of strong seductive power that sometimes puts people in a harmful situation. Here, with a set of three behavioural and two neuroimaging experiments including novel stimuli that strongly trigger curiosity (i.e. magic tricks), we examined the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the irresistible lure of curiosity. We consistently demonstrated that across different samples people were indeed willing to gamble to expose themselves to physical risks (i.e. electric shocks) in order to satisfy their curiosity for trivial knowledge that carries no apparent instrumental values. Also, underlying this seductive power of curiosity is its incentive salience properties, which share common neural mechanisms with extrinsic incentives (i.e. hunger for foods). In particular, the two independent fMRI experiments using different kinds of curiosity-stimulating stimuli found replicable results that acceptance (compared to rejection) of curiosityincentive-driven gambles was accompanied with an enhanced activity in the striatum.</p>
