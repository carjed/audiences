          <p>AbstractMADS-box transcription factors are ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms and play major roles during plant development. Nevertheless, their function in seed development remains largely unknown. Here we show that the imprinted Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-box TF PHERES1 (PHE1) is a master regulator of paternally expressed imprinted genes, as well as of non-imprinted key regulators of endosperm development. PHE1 binding sites show distinct epigenetic modifications on maternal and paternal alleles, correlating with parental-specific transcriptional activity. Importantly, we show that the CArG-box-like DNA-binding motifs bound by PHE1 have been distributed by RCHelitron transposable elements. Our data provide an example of molecular domestication of these elements, which by distributing PHE1 binding sites throughout the genome, have facilitated the recruitment of crucial endosperm regulators into a single transcriptional network.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Animal, fungi, and plant genome sequences harbour different non-canonical splice sites, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractMost protein encoding genes in eukaryotes contain introns which are inter-woven with exons. After transcription, introns need to be removed in order to generate the final mRNA which can be translated into an amino acid sequence by the ribosome. Precise excision of introns by the spliceosome requires conserved dinucleotides which mark the splice sites. However, there are variations of the highly conserved combination of GT at the 5’ end and AG at the 3’ end of an intron in the genome. GC-AG and AT-AC are two major non-canonical splice site combinations which are known for many years. During the last few years, various minor non-canonical splice site combinations were detected with all possible dinucleotide permutations. Here we expand systematic investigations of non-canonical splice site combinations in plant genomes to all eukaryotes by analysing fungal and animal genome sequences. Comparisons of splice site combinations between these three kingdoms revealed several differences such as a substantially increased CT-AC frequency in fungal genomes. In addition, high numbers of GA-AG splice site combinations were observed in two animal species. In depth investigation of splice site usage based on RNA-Seq read mappings indicates a generally higher flexibility of the 3’ splice site compared to the 5’ splice site.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Excess significance bias in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation literature for neuropsychiatric disorders, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIntroductionRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely tested and promoted for use in multiple neuropsychiatric conditions, but as for many other medical devices, some gaps may exist in the literature and the evidence base for rTMS clinical efficacy remains under debate. We aimed to empirically test for an excess number of statistically significant results in the literature on rTMS therapeutic efficacy across a wide range of meta-analyses and to characterize the power of studies included in these meta-analyses.MethodsBased on power calculations, we computed the expected number of “positive” datasets for a medium effect-size (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.30) and compared it with the number of observed “positive” datasets. Sensitivity analyses considered small (SMD=0.20), modest (SMD=0.50), and large (SMD=0.80) effect sizes.Results14 meta-analyses with 228 datasets (110 for neurological disorders and 118 for psychiatric disorders) were assessed. For SMD=0.3, the number of observed “positive” studies (n=94) was larger than expected (n=35). We found evidence for an excess of significant findings overall (p&amp;lt;0.0001) and in 814 meta-analyses. Evidence for an excess of significant findings was also observed for SMD=0.5 for neurological disorders. 0 (0 %), 0 (0 %), 3 (1 %), and 53 (23 %) of the 228 datasets had power &amp;gt;0.80, respectively for SMDs of 0.30, 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80.ConclusionMost studies in the rTMS literature are underpowered. This results in fragmentation and waste of research efforts. The somewhat high frequency of “positive” results seems spurious and may reflect bias.Trial Registration PROSPERO 2017 CRD42017056694</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Stacks 2 Analytical Methods for Paired-end Sequencing Improve RADseq-based Population Genomics, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractFor half a century population genetics studies have put type II restriction endonucleases to work. Now, coupled with massively-parallel, short-read sequencing, the family of RAD protocols that wields these enzymes has generated vast genetic knowledge from the natural world. Here we describe the first software capable of using paired-end sequencing to derive short contigs from de novo RAD data natively. Stacks version 2 employs a de Bruijn graph assembler to build contigs from paired-end reads and overlap those contigs with the corresponding single-end loci. The new architecture allows all the individuals in a meta population to be considered at the same time as each RAD locus is processed. This enables a Bayesian genotype caller to provide precise SNPs, and a robust algorithm to phase those SNPs into long haplotypes – generating RAD loci that are 400-800bp in length. To prove its recall and precision, we test the software with simulated data and compare reference-aligned and de novo analyses of three empirical datasets. We show that the latest version of Stacks is highly accurate and outperforms other software in assembling and genotyping paired-end de novo datasets.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">pathwayPCA an R package for integrative pathway analysis with modern PCA methodology and gene selection, bioRxiv, 2019-04-23</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWith the advance in high-throughput technology for molecular assays, multi-omics datasets have become increasingly available. However, most currently available pathway analysis software provide little or no functionalities for analyzing multiple types of -omics data simultaneously. In addition, most tools do not provide sample-specific estimates of pathway activities, which are important for precision medicine. To address these challenges, we present pathwayPCA, a unique R package for integrative pathway analysis that utilizes modern statistical methodology including supervised PCA and adaptive elastic-net PCA for principal component analysis. pathwayPCA can analyze continuous, binary, and survival outcomes in studies with multiple covariate andor interaction effects. We provide three case studies to illustrate pathway analysis with gene selection, integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets to identify driver genes, estimating and visualizing sample-specific pathway activities in ovarian cancer, and identifying sex-specific pathway effects in kidney cancer. pathwayPCA is an open source R package, freely available to the research community. We expect pathwayPCA to be a useful tool for empowering the wide scientific community on the analyses and interpretation of the wealth of multiomics data recently made available by TCGA, CPTAC and other large consortiums.</p>
