          <p>AbstractDefining the transcriptomic identity of clonally related malignant cells is challenging in the absence of cell surface markers that distinguish cancer clones from one another or from admixed non-neoplastic cells. While single-cell methods have been devised to capture both the transcriptome and genotype, these methods are not compatible with droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics, limiting their throughput. To overcome this limitation, we present single-cell Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT), which integrates cDNA genotyping with high-throughput droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq. We further demonstrate that multiplexed GoT can interrogate multiple genotypes for distinguishing subclonal transcriptomic identity. We apply GoT to 26,039 CD34&#43; cells across six patients with myeloid neoplasms, in which the complex process of hematopoiesis is corrupted by CALR-mutated stem and progenitor cells. We define high-resolution maps of malignant versus normal hematopoietic progenitors, and show that while mutant cells are comingled with wildtype cells throughout the hematopoietic progenitor landscape, their frequency increases with differentiation. We identify the unfolded protein response as a predominant outcome of CALR mutations, with significant cell identity dependency. Furthermore, we identify that CALR mutations lead to NF-κB pathway upregulation specifically in uncommitted early stem cells. Collectively, GoT provides high-throughput linkage of single-cell genotypes with transcriptomes and reveals that the transcriptional output of somatic mutations is heavily dependent on the native cell identity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">How face perception unfolds over time, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17</h4>
          <p>Within a fraction of a second of viewing a face, we have already determined its gender, age and identity. A full understanding of this remarkable feat will require a characterization of the computational steps it entails, along with the representations extracted at each. To this end, we used magnetoencephalography to measure the time course of neural responses to faces, thereby addressing two fundamental questions about how face processing unfolds over time. First, using representational similarity analysis, we found that facial gender and age information emerged before identity information, suggesting a coarse-to-fine processing of face dimensions. Second, identity and gender representations of familiar faces were enhanced very early on, indicating that the previously-reported behavioral benefit for familiar faces results from tuning of early feed-forward processing mechanisms. These findings start to reveal the time course of face perception in humans, and provide powerful new constraints on computational theories of face perception.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Maternal and fetal genetic effects on birth weight and their relevance to cardio-metabolic risk factors, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractBirth weight (BW) variation is influenced by fetal and maternal genetic and non-genetic factors, and has been reproducibly associated with future cardio-metabolic health outcomes. These associations have been proposed to reflect the lifelong consequences of an adverse intrauterine environment. In earlier work, we demonstrated that much of the negative correlation between BW and adult cardio-metabolic traits could instead be attributable to shared genetic effects. However, that work and other previous studies did not systematically distinguish the direct effects of an individual’s own genotype on BW and subsequent disease risk from indirect effects of their mother’s correlated genotype, mediated by the intrauterine environment. Here, we describe expanded genome-wide association analyses of own BW (n=321,223) and offspring BW (n=230,069 mothers), which identified 278 independent association signals influencing BW (214 novel). We used structural equation modelling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic influences on BW, implicating fetal- and maternal-specific mechanisms. We used Mendelian randomization to explore the causal relationships between factors influencing BW through fetal or maternal routes, for example, glycemic traits and blood pressure. Direct fetal genotype effects dominate the shared genetic contribution to the association between lower BW and higher type 2 diabetes risk, whereas the relationship between lower BW and higher later blood pressure (BP) is driven by a combination of indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects indirect effects of maternal BP-raising genotypes act to reduce offspring BW, but only direct fetal genotype effects (once inherited) increase the offspring’s later BP. Instrumental variable analysis using maternal BW-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring BP. In successfully separating fetal from maternal genetic effects, this work represents an important advance in genetic studies of perinatal outcomes, and shows that the association between lower BW and higher adult BP is attributable to genetic effects, and not to intrauterine programming.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">TADs pair homologous chromosomes to promote interchromosomal gene regulation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHomologous chromosomes colocalize to regulate gene expression in processes including genomic imprinting and X-inactivation, but the mechanisms driving these interactions are poorly understood. In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting an interchromosomal gene regulatory mechanism called transvection. Despite over a century of study, the molecular features that facilitate chromosome-wide pairing are unknown. The “button” model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with a higher affinity than their surrounding regions, but only a handful of DNA elements that drive homologous pairing between chromosomes have been described. Here, we identify button loci interspersed across the fly genome that have the ability to pair with their homologous sequences. Buttons are characterized by topologically associated domains (TADs), which drive pairing with their endogenous loci from multiple locations in the genome. Fragments of TADs do not pair, suggesting a model in which combinations of elements interspersed along the full length of a TAD are required for pairing. Though DNA-binding insulator proteins are not associated with pairing, buttons are enriched for insulator cofactors, suggesting that these proteins may mediate higher order interactions between homologous TADs. Using a TAD spanning the spinelessd gene as a paradigm, we find that pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. spineless pairing and transvection are cell-type-specific, suggesting that local buttoning and unbuttoning regulates transvection efficiency between cell types. Together, our data support a model in which specialized TADs button homologous chromosomes together to facilitate cell-type-specific interchromosomal gene regulation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Using long-read sequencing to detect imprinted DNA methylation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17</h4>
          <p>Systematic variation in the methylation of cytosines at CpG sites plays a critical role in early development of humans and other mammals. Of particular interest are regions of differential methylation between parental alleles, as these often dictate monoallelic gene expression, resulting in parent of origin specific control of the embryonic transcriptome and subsequent development, in a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Using long-read nanopore sequencing we show that, with an average genomic coverage of approximately ten, it is possible to determine both the level of methylation of CpG sites and the haplotype from which each read arises. The long-read property is exploited to characterise, using novel methods, both methylation and haplotype for reads that have reduced basecalling precision compared to Sanger sequencing. We validate the analysis both through comparison of nanopore-derived methylation patterns with those from Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing data and through comparison with previously reported data. Our analysis successfully identifies known imprinting control regions as well as some novel differentially methylated regions which, due to their proximity to hitherto unknown monoallelically expressed genes, may represent new imprinting control regions.</p>
