          <p>ABSTRACTSynthetic biology has enabled the development of powerful nucleic acid diagnostic technologies for detecting pathogens and human health biomarkers. Here we expand the reach of synthetic biology-enabled diagnostics by developing a cell-free biosensing platform that uses RNA output sensors activated by ligand induction (ROSALIND) to detect harmful contaminants in aqueous samples. ROSALIND consists of three programmable components highly-processive RNA polymerases, allosteric transcription factors, and synthetic DNA transcription templates. Together, these components allosterically regulate the in vitro transcription of a fluorescence-activating RNA aptamer in the absence of a target compound, transcription is blocked, while in its presence a fluorescent signal is produced. We demonstrate that ROSALIND can be configured to detect a range of water contaminants, including antibiotics, toxic small molecules, and metals. Our cell-free biosensing platform, which can be freeze-dried for field deployment, creates a new capability for point-of-use monitoring of molecular species to address growing global crises in water quality and human health.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Gephebase, a Database of Genotype-Phenotype Relationships for natural and domesticated variation in Eukaryotes, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractGephebase is a manually-curated database compiling our accumulated knowledge of the genes and mutations that underlie natural, domesticated and experimental phenotypic variation in all Eukaryotes â€” mostly animals, plants and yeasts. Gephebase aims to compile studies where the genotype-phenotype association (based on linkage mapping, association mapping or a candidate gene approach) is relatively well supported or understood. Human disease and aberrant mutant phenotypes in laboratory model organisms are not included in Gephebase and can be found in other databases (eg. OMIM, OMIA, Monarch Initiative). Gephebase contains more than 1700 entries. Each entry corresponds to an allelic difference at a given gene and its associated phenotypic change(s) between two species or between two individuals of the same species, and is enriched with molecular details, taxonomic information, and bibliographic information. Users can easily browse entries for their topic of interest and perform searches at various levels, whether phenotypic, genetic, taxonomic or bibliographic (eg. transposable elements, cis-regulatory mutations, snakes, carotenoid content, an author name). Data can be searched using keywords and boolean operators and is exportable in spreadsheet format. This database allows to perform meta-analysis to extract general information and global trends about evolution, genetics, and the field of evolutionary genetics itself. Gephebase should also help breeders, conservationists and others to identify the most promising target genes for traits of interest, with potential applications such as crop improvement, parasite and pest control, bioconservation, and genetic diagnostic.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Neighbor predation linked to natural competence fosters the transfer of large genomic regions in Vibrio cholerae, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractNatural competence for transformation is a primary mode of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Competent bacteria are able to absorb free DNA from their surroundings and exchange this DNA against pieces of their own genome when sufficiently homologous. And while it is known that transformation contributes to evolution and pathogen emergence in bacteria, there are still questions regarding the general prevalence of non-degraded DNA with sufficient coding capacity. In this context, we previously showed that the naturally competent bacterium Vibrio cholerae uses its type VI secretion system (T6SS) to actively acquire DNA from non-kin neighbors under chitin-colonizing conditions. We therefore sought to further explore the role of the T6SS in acquiring DNA, the condition of the DNA released through T6SS-mediated killing versus passive cell lysis, and the extent of the transfers that occur due to these conditions. To do this, we herein measured the frequency and the extent of genetic exchanges in bacterial co-cultures on competence-inducing chitin under various DNA-acquisition conditions. We show that competent V. cholerae strains acquire DNA fragments with an average and maximum length exceeding 50 kbp and 150 kbp, respectively, and that the T6SS is of prime importance for such HGT events. Collectively, our data support the notion that the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae fosters HGT and that the coding capacity of the exchanged genetic material is sufficient to significantly accelerate bacterial evolution.Significance StatementDNA shuffled from one organism to another in an inheritable manner is a common feature of prokaryotes. It is a significant mechanism by which bacteria acquire new phenotypes, for example by first absorbing foreign DNA and then recombining it into their genome. In this study, we show the remarkable extent of the exchanged genetic material, frequently exceeding 150 genes in a seemingly single transfer event, in Vibrio cholerae. We also show that to best preserve its length and quality, bacteria mainly acquire this DNA by killing adjacent, healthy neighbors then immediately absorbing the released DNA before it can be degraded. These new insights into this prey-killing DNA acquisition process shed light on how bacterial species evolve in the wild.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">RNA transcribed from heterochromatic simple-tandem repeats are required for male fertility and histone-protamine exchange in Drosophila melanogaster, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractLong arrays of simple, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (known as satellites) are enriched in centromeres1 and pericentromeric regions2, and contribute to chromosome segregation and other heterochromatin functions3,4. Surprisingly, satellite DNAs are expressed in many multicellular eukaryotes, and their aberrant transcription may contribute to carcinogenesis and cellular toxicity5-7. Satellite transcription andor RNAs may also promote centromere and heterochromatin activities 8-12. However, we lack direct evidence that satellite DNA transcripts are required for normal cell or organismal functions. Here, we show that satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cell types throughout Drosophila melanogaster development, enriched in neuronal tissues and testes, localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find that AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility and are specifically required for normal histone-protamine exchange and sperm chromatin organization. Since AAGAG RNA-dependent events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA functions in primary spermatocytes to â€˜primeâ€™ post-meiosis steps in sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating specific essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related Drosophila species suggest that satellite repeats and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The gut microbiota influences circulatory immune cell dynamics in humans, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe gut microbiota influences the development and homeostasis of the mammalian immune system1â€“3 and can alter immune cell compositions in mice4â€“7. However, our understanding of how the microbiota modulates immunity remains limited, particularly in humans where a lack of manipulative experiments makes inference challenging. Here we overcome this challenge by studying hundreds of hospitalizedâ€”and closely monitoredâ€”bone marrow transplantation patients as they recover from chemotherapy-induced immune ablation. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both white blood cell and microbiota populations allowing the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously over time, with unprecedented resolution. Our analysis shows that the ecological diversity of the gut microbiota had an immunosuppressive effect on circulating lymphocyte counts similar in magnitude to that of anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs administered to cancer patients. Moreover, by controlling for drug treatments and clinical metadata, we identified several microbiota components strongly associated with white blood cell dynamics Streptococcaceae associated with lymphocyte increase and Actinomycetaceae with lymphocyte suppression, Prevotellaceae with monocyte increase and Enterobacteriaceae with monocyte suppression, Ruminococcaceae with neutrophil increase and Lachnospiraceae and Bacteroidaceae with neutrophil suppression. Our analysis establishes a direct link between the intestinal microbiota and systemic immunity in humans, with implications on clinical outcomes and microbiota-based therapies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population imaging of neural activity in awake behaving mice in multiple brain regions, bioRxiv, 2019-04-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractA longstanding goal in neuroscience has been to image membrane voltage, with high temporal precision and sensitivity, in awake behaving mammals. Here, we report a genetically encoded voltage indicator, SomArchon, which exhibits millisecond response times and compatibility with optogenetic control, and which increases the sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and number of neurons observable, by manyfold over previous reagents. SomArchon only requires conventional one-photon microscopy to achieve these high performance characteristics. These improvements enable population analysis of neural activity, both at the subthreshold and spiking levels, in multiple brain regions â€“ cortex, hippocampus, and striatum â€“ of awake behaving mice. Using SomArchon, we detect both positive and negative responses of striatal neurons during movement, highlighting the power of voltage imaging to reveal bidirectional modulation. We also examine how the intracellular subthreshold theta oscillations of hippocampal neurons govern spike output, finding that nearby cells can exhibit highly correlated subthreshold activities, even as they generate highly divergent spiking patterns.</p>
