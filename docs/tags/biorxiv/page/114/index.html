          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomic analysis reveals a functional role for myocardial trabeculae in adults, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23</h4>
          <p>Since being first described by Leonardo da Vinci in 1513 it has remained an enigma why the endocardial surfaces of the adult heart retain a complex network of muscular trabeculae - with their persistence thought to be a vestige of embryonic development. For causative physiological inference we harness population genomics, image-based intermediate phenotyping and in silico modelling to determine the effect of this complex cardiovascular trait on function. Using deep learning-based image analysis we identified genetic associations with trabecular complexity in 18,097 UK Biobank participants which were replicated in an independently measured cohort of 1,129 healthy adults. Genes in these associated regions are enriched for expression in the fetal heart or vasculature and implicate loci associated with haemodynamic phenotypes and developmental pathways. A causal relationship between increasing trabecular complexity and both ventricular performance and electrical activity are supported by complementary biomechanical simulations and Mendelian randomisation studies. These findings show that myocardial trabeculae are a previously-unrecognised determinant of cardiovascular physiology in adult humans.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ion beam subcellular tomography, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23</h4>
          <p>Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) has been previously used to profile multiple parameters in two dimensions in single cells within tissue slices. Here, a mathematical and technical framework for three-dimensional subcellular MIBI is presented. We term the approach ion beam tomography (IBT) wherein ion beam images are acquired iteratively across successive, multiple scans and later compiled into a 3D format. For IBT, cells were imaged at 0.2-4 pA ion current across 1,000 axial scans. Consecutive subsets of ion beam images were binned over 3 to 20 slices (above and below) to create a resolved image, wherein binning was incremented one slice at a time to yield an enhanced multi-depth data without loss of depth resolution. Algorithmic deconvolution, tailored for ion beams, was then applied to the transformed ion image series using a hybrid deblurring algorithm and an ion beam current-dependent point-spread function. Three-dimensional processing was implemented by segmentation, mesh, molecular neighborhoods, and association maps. In cultured cancer cells and tissues, IBT enabled accessible visualization of three-dimensional volumetric distributions of genomic regions, RNA transcripts, and protein factors with 65-nm lateral and 5-nm axial resolution. IBT also enabled label-free elemental mapping of cells, allowing point of source cellular component measurements not possible for most optical microscopy targets. Detailed multiparameter imaging of subcellular features at near macromolecular resolution should now be made possible by the IBT tools and reagents provided here to open novel venues for interrogating subcellular biology.</p>

          <p>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease that occurs primarily in premature infants. We performed genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of 1,163 fecal samples from premature infants to identify microbial features predictive of NEC. Features considered include genes, bacterial strain types, eukaryotes, bacteriophages, plasmids and growth rates. A machine learning classifier found that samples collected prior to NEC diagnosis harbored significantly more Klebsiella, bacteria encoding fimbriae, and bacteria encoding secondary metabolite gene clusters related to quorum sensing and bacteriocin production. Notably, replication rates of all bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae, were significantly higher two days before NEC diagnosis. The findings uncover biomarkers that could lead to early detection of NEC and targets for microbiome-based therapeutics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolution-guided design of super-restrictor antiviral proteins reveals a breadth-versus-specificity tradeoff, bioRxiv, 2019-02-22</h4>
          <p>Host-virus evolutionary arms-races are driven by antagonistic interactions and often manifest as recurrent amino acid changes (i.e., positive selection) at their protein-protein interaction interfaces. Here, we investigated whether combinatorial mutagenesis of positions under positive selection in a host antiviral protein could enhance its restrictive properties. We tested ~800 variants of the human MxA protein, generated by combinatorial mutagenesis, for their ability to restrict Thogoto orthomyxovirus (THOV). We identified MxA â€˜super-restrictors&#39; with increased binding to THOV NP target protein and 10-fold higher anti-THOV restriction relative to wild-type human MxA, the most potent naturally-occurring anti-THOV restrictor identified. However, MxA super-restrictors of THOV were impaired in their restriction of influenza A virus. Our findings thus reveal a breadth-versus-specificity tradeoff that constrains the adaptive landscape of antiviral proteins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Subcellular localization of drug distribution by super-resolution ion beam imaging, bioRxiv, 2019-02-22</h4>
          <p>Technologies that visualize multiple biomolecules at the nanometer scale in cells will enable deeper understanding of biological processes that proceed at the molecular scale. Current fluorescence-based methods for microscopy are constrained by a combination of spatial resolution limitations, limited parameters per experiment, and detector systems for the wide variety of biomolecules found in cells. We present here super-resolution ion beam imaging (srIBI), a secondary ion mass spectrometry approach capable of high-parameter imaging in 3D of targeted biological entities and exogenously added small molecules. Uniquely, the atomic constituents of the biomolecules themselves can often be used in our system as the tag. We visualized the subcellular localization of the chemotherapy drug cisplatin simultaneously with localization of five other nuclear structures, with further carbon elemental mapping and secondary electron visualization, down to ~30 nm lateral resolution. Cisplatin was preferentially enriched in nuclear speckles and excluded from closed-chromatin regions, indicative of a role for cisplatin in active regions of chromatin. These data highlight how multiplexed super-resolution techniques, such as srIBI, will enable studies of biomolecule distributions in biologically relevant subcellular microenvironments.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The effect of environmental enrichment on behavioral variability depends on genotype, behavior, and type of enrichment, bioRxiv, 2019-02-22</h4>
          <p>Non-genetic individuality in behavior, also termed intragenotypic variability, has been observed across many different organisms. A potential cause of intragenotypic variability is sensitivity to minute environmental differences during development, even as major environmental parameters are kept constant. Animal enrichment paradigms often include the addition of environmental diversity, whether in the form of social interaction, novel objects, or exploratory opportunities. Enrichment could plausibly affect intragenotypic variability in opposing ways it could cause an increase in variability due to the increase in microenvironmental variation, or a decrease in variability due to elimination of aberrant behavior as animals are taken out of impoverished laboratory conditions. In order to test our hypothesis, we assayed five isogenic Drosophila melanogaster lines raised in control and mild enrichment conditions, and one isogenic line under both mild and intense enrichment conditions. We compared the mean and variability of six behavioral metrics between our enriched fly populations and the laboratory housing control. We found that enrichment often caused a small increase in variability across most of our behaviors, but that the ultimate effect of enrichment on both behavioral means and variabilities was highly dependent on genotype and its interaction with the particular enrichment treatment. Our results support previous work on enrichment that presents a highly variable picture of its effects on both behavior and physiology.</p>
