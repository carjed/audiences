          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fate mapping via Ms4a3 expression history traces monocyte-derived cells, bioRxiv, 2019-05-28</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYMost tissue-resident macrophage (RTM) populations are seeded by waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and are self-maintained independently of a bone-marrow contribution during adulthood. A proportion of RTMs, however, is constantly replaced by blood monocytes and their functions compared to embryonic RTM remains unclear. The kinetics and extent of the contribution of circulating monocytes to RTM replacement during homeostasis, inflammation and disease is highly debated. Here, we identified Ms4a3 as a specific marker expressed by granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and subsequently generated Ms4a3TdT reporter and Ms4a3Cre-RosaTdT fate mapper models to follow monocytes and their progenies. Our Ms4a3Cre-RosaTdT model traced efficiently blood monocytes (97%) and granulocytes (100%), but no lymphocytes or tissue dendritic cells. Using this model, we precisely quantified the contribution of monocytes to the RTM pool during homeostasis and inflammation. The unambiguous identification of monocyte-derived cells will permit future studies of their function under any condition.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">RNASeqR an R package for automated two-group RNA-Seq analysis workflow, bioRxiv, 2019-05-28</h4>
          <p>RNA-Seq analysis has revolutionized researchers&#39; understanding of the transcriptome in biological research. Assessing the differences in transcriptomic profiles between tissue samples or patient groups enables researchers to explore the underlying biological impact of transcription. RNA-Seq analysis requires multiple processing steps and huge computational capabilities. There are many well-developed R packages for individual steps; however, there are few RBioconductor packages that integrate existing software tools into a comprehensive RNA-Seq analysis and provide fundamental end-to-end results in pure R environment so that researchers can quickly and easily get fundamental information in big sequencing data. To address this need, we have developed the open source RBioconductor package, RNASeqR. It allows users to run an automated RNA-Seq analysis with only six steps, producing essential tabular and graphical results for further biological interpretation. The features of RNASeqR include six-step analysis, comprehensive visualization, background execution version, and the integration of both R and command-line software. RNASeqR provides fast, light-weight, and easy-to-run RNA-Seq analysis pipeline in pure R environment. It allows users to efficiently utilize popular software tools, including both RBioconductor and command-line tools, without predefining the resources or environments. RNASeqR is freely available for Linux and macOS operating systems from Bioconductor (httpsbioconductor.orgpackagesreleasebiochtmlRNASeqR.html).</p>

          <p>AbstractThe rise of electronic assisted presentation programs such as PowerPoint in undergraduate large lecture biology classes has displaced more traditional hand-drawn lectures such as the blackboard or overhead projectors, referred here as “chalk-talk” approaches. But which method is more effective in a large lecture microbiology classroom is unclear. Here I present data from a large microbial genetics lecture course taken during a five-year span comparing PowerPoint to chalk-talk lecturing methods. The results indicate that the chalk-talk approach was preferred by the students and rated higher in all measured metrics including course enjoyment, learning of key concepts, and course outcomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An Algorithmic Barrier to Neural Circuit Understanding, bioRxiv, 2019-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractNeuroscience is witnessing extraordinary progress in experimental techniques, especially at the neural circuit level. These advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand how neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behavior. Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we examine how many experiments are needed to obtain such an empirical understanding. It is proved, mathematically, that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in general, unless a widely-posited hypothesis about computation is false. Worse still, the feasible experimental regime is one where the number of experiments scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons, suggesting a fundamental impediment to such an understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are algorithmically tractable, thus, becomes an important new endeavor in Neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Mammary mechanobiology PIEZO1 mechanically-activated ion channels in lactation and involution, bioRxiv, 2019-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractA mother’s ability to produce a nutritionally-complete neonatal food source has provided a powerful evolutionary advantage to mammals. Milk production by secretory mammary epithelial cells is adaptive, its release is exquisitely timed and its own glandular stagnation with the permanent cessation of suckling triggers the programmed cell death and tissue remodeling that enables female mammals to nurse successive progeny. Both chemical and mechanical signals control epithelial expansion, function and remodeling. Despite this duality of input, however, the nature and function of mechanical forces in the mammary gland remain unknown. Here, we characterize the mammary force landscape and the capacity of luminal and basal epithelial cells to experience and exert force. We explore the molecular instruments for force-sensing in the mammary gland and the physiological requirement for PIEZO1 in lactation and involution. Our study supports the existence of a multifaceted system of chemical and mechanical sensing in the mammary gland, and a protective redundancy that ensures continued lactational competence and offspring survival.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population history and genetic adaptation of the Fulani nomads Inferences from genome-wide data and the lactase persistence trait, bioRxiv, 2019-05-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractHuman population history in the Holocene was profoundly impacted by changes in lifestyle following the invention and adoption of food-production practices. These changes triggered significant increases in population sizes and expansions over large distances. Here we investigate the population history of the Fulani, a pastoral population extending throughout the African SahelSavannah belt. Based on genome-wide analyses we propose that ancestors of the Fulani population experienced admixture between a West African group and a group carrying both European and North African ancestries. This admixture was likely coupled with newly adopted herding practices, as it resulted in signatures of genetic adaptation in contemporary Fulani genomes, including the control element of the LCT gene enabling carriers to digest lactose throughout their lives. The lactase persistence (LP) trait in the Fulani is conferred by the presence of the allele T-13910, which is also present at high frequencies in Europe. We establish that the T-13910 LP allele in Fulani individuals analysed in this study lies on a European haplotype background thus excluding parallel convergent evolution. Our findings further suggest that Eurasian admixture and the European LP allele was introduced into the Fulani through contact with a North African populations. We furthermore confirm the link between the lactose digestion phenotype in the Fulani to the MCM6LCT locus by reporting the first Genome Wide Association study (GWAS) of the lactase persistence trait. We also further explored signals of recent adaptation in the Fulani and identified additional candidates for selection to adapt to herding life-styles.</p>
