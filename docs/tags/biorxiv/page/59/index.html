          <p>Pancreatic islet cells regulate glucose homeostasis through insulin and glucagon secretion; dysfunction of these cells leads to severe diseases like diabetes. Prior single-cell transcriptome studies have shown heterogeneous gene expression in major islet cell-types; however it remains challenging to reconcile this transcriptomic heterogeneity with observed islet cell functional variation. Here we achieved electrophysiological profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing in the same islet cell (pancreas patch-seq) thereby linking transcriptomic phenotypes to physiologic properties. We collected 1,369 cells from the pancreas of donors with or without diabetes and assessed function-gene expression networks. We identified a set of genes and pathways that drive functional heterogeneity in β-cells and used these to predict β-cell electrophysiology. We also report specific transcriptional programs that correlate with dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and extend this approach to cryopreserved cells from donors with type 1 diabetes (T1D), generating a valuable resource for understanding islet cell heterogeneity in health and disease.</p>

          <p>MINFLUX offers a breakthrough in single molecule localization precision, but suffers from a tiny field of-view and a lack of practical parallelism. Here, we combine centroid estimation and illumination pattern induced photon count variations in a conventional widefield imaging setup to extract position information over a typical micron sized field-of-view. We show a near twofold improvement in precision over standard localization with the same photon count on DNA-origami nano-structures.</p>

          <p>Spatial metabolomics describes the location and chemistry of small molecules involved in metabolic phenotypes, defense molecules and chemical interactions in natural communities. Most current techniques are unable to spatially link the genotype and metabolic phenotype of microorganisms in situ at a scale relevant to microbial interactions. Here, we present a spatial metabolomics pipeline (metaFISH) that combines fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) microscopy and high-resolution atmospheric pressure mass spectrometry imaging (AP-MALDI-MSI) to image host-microbe symbioses and their metabolic interactions. metaFISH aligns and integrates metabolite and fluorescent images at the micrometer-scale for a spatial assignment of host and symbiont metabolites on the same tissue section. To illustrate the advantages of metaFISH, we mapped the spatial metabolome of a deep-sea mussel and its intracellular symbiotic bacteria at the scale of individual epithelial host cells. Our analytical pipeline revealed metabolic adaptations of the epithelial cells to the intracellular symbionts, a variation in metabolic phenotypes in one symbiont type, and novel symbiosis metabolites. metaFISH provides a culture-independent approach to link metabolic phenotypes to community members in situ - a powerful tool for microbiologists across fields.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Hospital use of antibiotics as the main driver of infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria - a reanalysis of recent data from the European Union, bioRxiv, 2019-02-19</h4>
          <p>Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria causes significant morbidity worldwide. The development and acquisition of resistance to antibiotics is believed to primarily develop under the selective pressure of widespread antibiotic use in humans, however antimicrobial usage in livestock has been proposed as additional, if not principal, driver of antibiotic resistance. In this work, we correlate recent data from the European Union on antibiotic resistance rates with data on antibiotic usage in the primary care and hospital sector and data on veterinary antimicrobial consumption across the individual member states. We quantify the strength of these different potential drivers of antimicrobial resistance in order to compare their biological importance. We found that the correlation between antibiotic use in the hospital sector and antibiotic resistance rates is significantly higher than the correlation between resistance rates and any of the other two predictors. This suggests increased antibiotic use in hospitals as the main driver of the development of antibiotic resistances and necessitates further research on and a re-evaluation of the risks associated with antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Self-inactivating rabies viruses are just first-generation, ΔG rabies viruses, bioRxiv, 2019-02-19</h4>
          <p>A recent article in Cell reported a new form of modified rabies virus that was apparently capable of labeling neurons without adverse effects on neuronal physiology and circuit function. These self-inactivating rabies (SiR) viruses differed from the widely-used first-generation deletion-mutant (ΔG) rabies viruses only by the addition of a destabilization domain to the viral nucleoprotein. However, we observed that the transsynaptic tracing results from that article were inconsistent with the logic described in it, and we hypothesized that the viruses used were actually mutants that had lost the intended modification to the nucleoprotein. We obtained samples of two SiR viruses from the authors and show here that, in both SiR-CRE and SiR-FLPo, the great majority of viral particles were indeed mutants that had lost the intended modification and were therefore just first-generation, ΔG rabies viruses. We also found that SiR-CRE killed 70% of infected neurons in vivo within two weeks. We have shown elsewhere that a ΔG rabies virus encoding Cre can leave a large percentage of labeled neurons alive; we presume that Ciabatti et al. found such remaining neurons at long survival times and mistakenly concluded that they had developed a nontoxic version of rabies virus. Here we have analyzed only the two samples that were sent to MIT by Ciabatti et al., and these may not be from the same batches that were used for their paper. However, 1) both of the two viruses that we analyzed had independently lost the intended modification, 2) the mutations in the two samples were genetically quite distinct from each other yet in both cases caused the same result total or near-total loss of the C-terminal modification, and 3) the mutations that we found in these two virus samples perfectly explain the otherwise-paradoxical transsynaptic tracing results from Ciabatti et al.&#39;s paper. We suggest that the SiR strategy, or any other such attempt to attenuate a virus by addition rather than deletion, is an inherently unstable approach that can easily be evaded by mutation, as it was in this case.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations in a gene under selection, bioRxiv, 2019-02-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe fitness effects of synonymous mutations, nucleotide changes that do not alter the encoded amino acid, have often been assumed to be neutral, but a growing body of evidence suggests otherwise. We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations for a gene under selection. Synonymous mutations had highly variable fitness effects, both deleterious and beneficial, resembling those of nonsynonymous mutations in the same gene. This variation in fitness was underlain by changes in transcription linked to the creation of internal promoter sites. A positive correlation between fitness and the presence of synonymous substitutions across a phylogeny of related Pseudomonads suggests these mutations may be common in nature. Taken together, our results provide the most compelling evidence to date that synonymous mutations with non-neutral fitness effects may in fact be commonplace.</p>
