          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comparison of adopted and non-adopted individuals reveals gene-environment interplay for education in the UK Biobank, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractIndividual-level polygenic scores can now explain ∼10% of the variation in number of years of completed education. However, associations between polygenic scores and education capture not only genetic propensity but information about the environment that individuals are exposed to. This is because individuals passively inherit effects of parental genotypes, since their parents typically also provide the rearing environment. In other words, the strong correlation between offspring and parent genotypes results in an association between the offspring genotypes and the rearing environment. This is termed passive gene-environment correlation. We present an approach to test for the extent of passive gene-environment correlation for education without requiring intergenerational data. Specifically, we use information from 6311 individuals in the UK Biobank who were adopted in childhood to compare genetic influence on education between adoptees and non-adopted individuals. Adoptees’ rearing environments are less correlated with their genotypes, because they do not share genes with their adoptive parents. We find that polygenic scores are twice as predictive of years of education in non-adopted individuals compared to adoptees (R2= 0.074 vs 0.037, difference test p= 8.23 × 10−24). We provide another kind of evidence for the influence of parental behaviour on offspring education individuals in the lowest decile of education polygenic score attain significantly more education if they are adopted, possibly due to educationally supportive adoptive environments. Overall, these results suggest that genetic influences on education are mediated via the home environment. As such, polygenic prediction of educational attainment represents gene-environment correlations just as much as it represents direct genetic effects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome sequence of the cluster root forming white lupin, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is a legume that produces seeds recognized for their high protein content and good nutritional value (lowest glycemic index of all grains, high dietary fiber content, and zero gluten or starch)1–5. White lupin can form nitrogen-fixing nodules but has lost the ability to form mycorrhizal symbiosis with fungi6. Nevertheless, its root system is well adapted to poor soils it produces cluster roots, constituted of dozens of determinate lateral roots that improve soil exploration and phosphate remobilization7. As phosphate is a limited resource that comes from rock reserves8, the production of cluster roots is a trait of interest to improve fertilizers efficiency. Using long reads sequencing technologies, we provide a high-quality genome sequence of a modern variety of white lupin (2n=50, 451 Mb), as well as de novo assemblies of a landrace and a wild relative. We describe how domestication impacted soil exploration capacity through the early establishment of lateral and cluster roots. We identify the APETALA2 transcription factor LaPUCHI-1, homolog of the Arabidopsis morphogenesis coordinator9, as a potential regulator of this trait. Our high-quality genome and companion genomic and transcriptomic resources enable the development of modern breeding strategies to increase and stabilize yield and to develop new varieties with reduced allergenic properties (caused by conglutins10), which would favor the deployment of this promising culture.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">H3K4me3 is neither instructive for, nor informed by, transcription, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractH3K4me3 is a near-universal histone modification found predominantly at the 5’ region of genes, with a well-documented association with gene activity. H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over. Constitutive genes are generally well-expressed, which may alone explain the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene expression, while the biological role of H3K4me3 may have more to do with this distinction in gene class.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">ORANGE A CRISPRCas9-based genome editing toolbox for epitope tagging of endogenous proteins in neurons, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe correct subcellular distribution of protein complexes establishes the complex morphology of neurons and is fundamental to their functioning. Thus, determining the dynamic distribution of proteins is essential to understand neuronal processes. Fluorescence imaging, in particular super-resolution microscopy, has become invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution. However, these approaches suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins. We developed ORANGE an Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, that mediates targeted genomic integration of fluorescent tags in neurons. This toolbox includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, and a detailed protocol explaining how knock-in can be developed for novel targets. In combination with super-resolution microscopy, ORANGE revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neuronal signaling molecules, synaptic scaffolding proteins, and neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, ORANGE enables quantitation of expression and distribution for virtually any protein in neurons at high resolution and will significantly further our understanding of neuronal cell biology.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">μDamID a microfluidic approach for imaging and sequencing protein-DNA interactions in single cells, bioRxiv, 2019-07-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenome regulation depends on carefully programmed protein-DNA interactions that maintain or alter gene expression states, often by influencing chromatin organization. Most studies of these interactions to date have relied on bulk methods, which in many systems cannot capture the dynamic single-cell nature of these interactions as they modulate cell states. One method allowing for sensitive single-cell mapping of protein-DNA interactions is DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID), which records a protein’s DNA-binding history by methylating adenine bases in its vicinity, then selectively amplifies and sequences these methylated regions. These interaction sites can also be visualized using fluorescent proteins that bind to methyladenines. Here we combine these imaging and sequencing technologies in an integrated microfluidic platform (μDamID) that enables single-cell isolation, imaging, and sorting, followed by DamID. We apply this system to generate paired single-cell imaging and sequencing data from a human cell line, in which we map and validate interactions between DNA and nuclear lamina proteins, providing a measure of 3D chromatin organization and broad gene regulation patterns. μDamID provides the unique ability to compare paired imaging and sequencing data for each cell and between cells, enabling the joint analysis of the nuclear localization, sequence identity, and variability of protein-DNA interactions.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most popular and iconic feline species on the planet, yet in spite of its popularity, the last century has seen massive declines for lion populations worldwide. Genomic resources for endangered species represent an important way forward for the field of conservation, enabling high-resolution studies of demography, disease, and population dynamics. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly for the captive African lion from the Exotic Feline Rescue Center as a resource for current and subsequent genetic work of the sole social species of the Panthera clade. Our assembly is composed of 10x Genomics Chromium data, Dovetail Hi-C, and Oxford Nanopore long-read data. Synteny is highly conserved between the lion, other Panthera genomes, and the domestic cat. We find variability in the length and levels of homozygosity across the genomes of the lion sequenced here and other previous published resequence data, indicating contrasting histories of recent and ancient small population sizes andor inbreeding. Demographic analyses reveal similar histories across all individuals except the Asiatic lion, which shows a more rapid decline in population size. This high-quality genome will greatly aid in the continuing research and conservation efforts for the lion.</p>
