          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Interdependent Phenotypic and Biogeographic Evolution Driven by Biotic Interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Biotic interactions are hypothesized to be one of the main processes shaping trait and biogeographic evolution during lineage diversification. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that species with similar ecological requirements either spatially exclude each other, by preventing the colonization of competitors or by driving coexisting populations to extinction, or show niche divergence when in sympatry. However, the extent and generality of the effect of interspecific competition in trait and biogeographic evolution has been limited by a dearth of appropriate process-generating models to directly test the effect of biotic interactions. Here, we formulate a phylogenetic parametric model that allows interdependence between trait and biogeographic evolution, thus enabling a direct test of central hypotheses on how biotic interactions shape these evolutionary processes. We adopt a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of trait histories, range histories, and co-evolutionary process parameters under this analytically intractable model. Through simulations, we show that our model is capable of distinguishing alternative scenarios of biotic interactions. We apply our model to the radiation of Darwin&#39;s finches---a classic example of adaptive divergence---and find support for in situ trait divergence in beak size, convergence in traits such as beak shape and tarsus length, and strong competitive exclusion throughout their evolutionary history. Our modeling framework opens new possibilities for testing more complex hypotheses about the processes underlying lineage diversification. More generally, it provides a robust probabilistic methodology to model correlated evolution of continuous and discrete characters.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring single cell divisions in human cancers from multi-region sequencing data, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Cancer is driven by complex evolutionary dynamics involving billions of cells. Increasing effort has been dedicated to sequence single tumour cells, but obtaining robust measurements remains challenging. Here we show that multi-region sequencing of bulk tumour samples contains quantitative information on single-cell divisions that is accessible if combined with evolutionary theory. Using high-throughput data from 16 human cancers, we measured the in vivo per-cell point mutation rate (mean 1.69*10^(-8) bp per cell division) and per-cell survival rate (mean 0.57) in individual patient tumours from colon, lung and renal cancers. Per-cell mutation rates varied 50-fold between individuals, and per-cell survival rates were between nearly-homeostatic and almost perfect cell doublings, equating to tumour ages between 1 and 19 years. Furthermore, reanalysing a recent dataset of 89 whole-genome sequenced healthy haematopoietic stem cells, we find 1.14 mutations per genome per cell division and near perfect cell doublings (per-cell survival rate 0.96) during early haematopoietic development. Our analysis measures in vivo the most fundamental properties of human cancer and healthy somatic evolution at single-cell resolution within single individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Samovar Single-sample mosaic SNV calling with linked reads, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>We present Samovar, a mosaic single-nucleotide variant (SNV) caller for linked-read whole-genome shotgun sequencing data. Samovar scores candidate sites using a random forest model trained using the input dataset that considers read quality, phasing, and linked-read characteristics. We show Samovar calls mosaic SNVs within a single sample with accuracy comparable to what previously required trios or matched tumornormal pairs and outperform single-sample mosaic variant callers at MAF 5%-50% with at least 30x coverage. Furthermore, we use Samovar to find somatic variants in whole genome sequencing of both tumor and normal from 13 pediatric cancer cases that can be corroborated with high recall with whole exome sequencing. Samovar is available open-source at httpsgithub.comcdarbysamovar under the MIT license.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability in large-scale brain systems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26</h4>
          <p>Many studies of large-scale neural systems have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations (functional connectivity) during task states relative to resting state. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations&#39; dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate inference of tree topologies from multiple sequence alignments using deep learning, bioRxiv, 2019-02-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractReconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between species is one of the most formidable tasks in evolutionary biology. Multiple methods exist to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Both simulation and empirical studies have identified several “zones” of parameter space where accuracy of some methods can plummet, even for four-taxon trees. Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency andor the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. Here we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods. While numerous practical challenges remain, these findings suggest that deep learning approaches such as ours have the potential to produce more accurate phylogenetic inferences.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Antibiotic production in Streptomyces is organized by a division of labour through terminal genomic differentiation, bioRxiv, 2019-02-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractOne of the hallmark behaviors of social groups is division of labour, where different group members become specialized to carry out complementary tasks. By dividing labour, cooperative groups of individuals increase their efficiency, thereby raising group fitness even if these specialized behaviors reduce the fitness of individual group members. Here we provide evidence that antibiotic production in colonies of the multicellular bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is coordinated by a division of labour. We show that S. coelicolor colonies are genetically heterogeneous due to massive amplifications and deletions to the chromosome. Cells with gross chromosomal changes produce an increased diversity of secondary metabolites and secrete significantly more antibiotics; however, these changes come at the cost of dramatically reduced individual fitness, providing direct evidence for a trade-off between secondary metabolite production and fitness. Finally, we show that colonies containing mixtures of mutant strains and their parents produce significantly more antibiotics, while colony-wide spore production remains unchanged. Our work demonstrates that by generating mutants that are specialized to hyper-produce antibiotics, streptomycetes reduce the colony-wide fitness costs of secreted secondary metabolites while maximizing the yield and diversity of these products.</p>
