          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Lineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation, bioRxiv, 2018-11-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractA challenge in stem cell biology is to associate molecular differences among progenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cell types. Though the development of single cell assays allows for the capture of progenitor cell states in great detail, these assays cannot definitively link cell states to their long-term fate. Here, we use expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace single cell transcriptomes dynamically during differentiation and apply this approach to the study of hematopoiesis. Our analysis identifies functional boundaries of cell potential early in the hematopoietic hierarchy and locates them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We reconstruct a developmental hierarchy showing separate ontogenies for granulocytic subtypes and two routes to monocyte differentiation that leave a persistent imprint on mature cells. Finally, we use our approach to benchmark methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, and provide evidence of strong early fate biases dependent on cellular properties hidden from single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nanopore native RNA sequencing of a human poly(A) transcriptome, bioRxiv, 2018-11-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTHigh throughput cDNA sequencing technologies have dramatically advanced our understanding of transcriptome complexity and regulation. However, these methods lose information contained in biological RNA because the copied reads are often short and because modifications are not carried forward in cDNA. We address these limitations using a native poly(A) RNA sequencing strategy developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Our study focused on poly(A) RNA from the human cell line GM12878, generating 9.9 million aligned sequence reads. These native RNA reads had an aligned N50 length of 1294 bases, and a maximum aligned length of over 21,000 bases. A total of 78,199 high-confidence isoforms were identified by combining long nanopore reads with short higher accuracy Illumina reads. We describe strategies for assessing 3′ poly(A) tail length, base modifications and transcript haplotypes from nanopore RNA data. Together, these nanopore-based techniques are poised to deliver new insights into RNA biology.DISCLOSURESMA holds shares in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MA is a paid consultant to ONT.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A polyploid admixed origin of beer yeasts derived from European and Asian wine populations, bioRxiv, 2018-11-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractStrains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used to make beer, bread and wine are genetically and phenotypically distinct from wild populations associated with trees. The origins of these domesticated populations are not always clear; human-associated migration and admixture with wild populations have had a strong impact on S. cerevisiae population structure. We examined the population genetic history of beer strains and find that ale strains and the S. cerevisiae portion of allotetraploid lager strains were derived from admixture between populations closely related to European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to both lager and baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing them with a passive means of remaining isolated from other populations and providing us with a living relic of their ancestral hybridization. To reconstruct their polyploid origin we phased the genomes of two ale strains and found ale haplotypes to both be recombinants between European and Asian alleles and to also contain novel alleles derived from extinct or as yet uncharacterized populations. We conclude that modern beer strains are the product of a historical melting pot of fermentation technology.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTRapid technological progress in the recent years has allowed the high-throughput interrogation of different types of biomolecules from single cells. Combining several of these readouts into integrated multi-omic assays is essential to comprehensively understand and model cellular processes. Here, we report the development of Expanded CRISPR-compatible Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell transcriptome, immune receptor clonotypes, surface markers, sample identity and sgRNAs. We demonstrate the use of ECCITE-seq to directly and efficiently capture sgRNA molecules and measure their effects on gene expression and protein levels, opening the possibility of performing high throughput single cell CRISPR screens with multimodal readout using existing libraries and commonly used vectors. Finally, by utilizing the combined phenotyping of clonotype and cell surface markers in immune cells, we apply ECCITE to study a lymphoma sample to discriminate cells and define molecular signatures of malignant cells within a heterogeneous population.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomic architecture and introgression shape a butterfly radiation, bioRxiv, 2018-11-09</h4>
          <p>We here pioneer a low-cost assembly strategy for 20 Heliconiini genomes to characterize the evolutionary history of the rapidly radiating genus Heliconius. A bifurcating tree provides a poor fit to the data, and we therefore explore a reticulate phylogeny for Heliconius. We probe the genomic architecture of gene flow, and develop a new method to distinguish incomplete lineage sorting from introgression. We find that most loci with non-canonical histories arose through introgression, and are strongly underrepresented in regions of low recombination and high gene density. This is expected if introgressed alleles are more likely to be purged in such regions due to tighter linkage with incompatibility loci. Finally, we identify a hitherto unrecognized inversion, and show it is a convergent structural rearrangement that captures a known color pattern switch locus within the genus. Our multi-genome assembly approach enables an improved understanding of adaptive radiation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">OrthoFinder phylogenetic orthology inference for comparative genomics, bioRxiv, 2018-11-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractHere, we present a major advance of the OrthoFinder method. This extends OrthoFinder’s high accuracy orthogroup inference to provide phylogenetic inference of orthologs, rooted genes trees, gene duplication events, the rooted species tree, and comparative genomic statistics. Each output is benchmarked on appropriate real or simulated datasets and, where comparable methods exist, OrthoFinder is equivalent to or outperforms these methods. Furthermore, OrthoFinder is the most accurate ortholog inference method on the Quest for Orthologs benchmark test. Finally, OrthoFinder’s comprehensive phylogenetic analysis is achieved with equivalent speed and scalability to the fastest, score-based heuristic methods.
