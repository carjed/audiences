          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distinct characteristics of genes associated with phenome-wide variation in maize (Zea mays), bioRxiv, 2019-01-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTNaturally occurring functional genetic variation is often employed to identify genetic loci that regulate specific traits. Existing approaches to link functional genetic variation to quantitative phenotypic outcomes typically evaluate one or several traits at a time. Advances in high throughput phenotyping now enable datasets which include information on dozens or hundreds of traits scored across multiple environments. Here, we develop an approach to use data from many phenotypic traits simultaneously to identify causal genetic loci. Using data for 260 traits scored across a maize diversity panel, we demonstrate that a distinct set of genes are identified relative to conventional genome wide association. The genes identified using this many-trait approach are more likely to be independently validated than the genes identified by conventional analysis of the same dataset. Genes identified by the new many-trait approach share a number of molecular, population genetic, and evolutionary features with a gold standard set of genes characterized through forward genetics. These features, as well as substantially stronger functional enrichment and purification, separate them from both genes identified by conventional genome wide association and from the overall population of annotated gene models. These results are consistent with a large subset of annotated gene models in maize playing little or no role in determining organismal phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Is it time to change the reference genome?, bioRxiv, 2019-01-30</h4>
          <p>The use of the human reference genome has shaped methods and data across modern genomics.  This has offered many benefits while creating a few constraints. In the following piece, we outline the history, properties, and pitfalls of the current human reference genome. In a few illustrative analyses, we focus on its use for variant-calling, highlighting its nearness to a type specimen. We suggest that switching to a consensus reference offers important advantages over the current reference with few disadvantages.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Constant sub-second cycling between representations of possible futures in the hippocampus, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29</h4>
          <p>Cognitive faculties such as imagination, planning, and decision-making entail the ability to project into the future. Crucially, animal behavior in natural settings implies that the brain can generate representations of future scenarios not only quickly but also constantly over time, as external events continually unfold. Despite this insight, how the brain accomplishes this remains unknown. Here we report neural activity in the hippocampus encoding two future scenarios (two upcoming maze paths) in constant alternation at 8 Hz one scenario per 8 Hz cycle (125 ms). We further found that the underlying cycling dynamic generalized across multiple hippocampal representations (location and direction) relevant to future behavior. These findings identify an extremely fast and regular dynamical process capable of representing future possibilities.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evaluating potential drug targets through human loss-of-function genetic variation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractHuman genetics has informed the clinical development of new drugs, and is beginning to influence the selection of new drug targets. Large-scale DNA sequencing studies have created a catalogue of naturally occurring genetic variants predicted to cause loss of function in human genes, which in principle should provide powerful in vivo models of human genetic “knockouts” to complement model organism knockout studies and inform drug development. Here, we consider the use of predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variation catalogued in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) for the evaluation of genes as potential drug targets. Many drug targets, including the targets of highly successful inhibitors such as aspirin and statins, are under natural selection at least as extreme as known haploinsufficient genes, with pLoF variants almost completely depleted from the population. Thus, metrics of gene essentiality should not be used to eliminate genes from consideration as potential targets. The identification of individual humans harboring “knockouts” (biallelic gene inactivation), followed by individual recall and deep phenotyping, is highly valuable to study gene function. In most genes, pLoF alleles are sufficiently rare that ascertainment will be largely limited to heterozygous individuals in outbred populations. Sampling of diverse bottlenecked populations and consanguineous individuals will aid in identification of total “knockouts”. Careful filtering and curation of pLoF variants in a gene of interest is necessary in order to identify true LoF individuals for follow-up, and the positional distribution or frequency of true LoF variants may reveal important disease biology. Our analysis suggests that the value of pLoF variant data for drug discovery lies in deep curation informed by the nature of the drug and its indication, as well as the biology of the gene, followed by recall-by-genotype studies in targeted populations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Facilitating open-science with realistic fMRI simulation validation and application, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29</h4>
          <p>Background With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these methods. Simulations of fMRI data can aid in both the evaluation of complex designs and the analysis of data. New Method We present fmrisim, a new Python package for standardized, realistic simulation of fMRI data. This package is part of BrainIAK a recently released open-source Python toolbox for advanced neuroimaging analyses. We describe how to use fmrisim to extract noise properties from real fMRI data and then create a synthetic dataset with matched noise properties and a user-specified signal. Results We validate the noise generated by fmrisim to show that it can approximate the noise properties of real data. We further show how fmrisim can help researchers find the optimal design in terms of power. Comparison with other methods fmrisim ports the functionality of other packages to the Python platform while extending what is available in order to make it seamless to simulate realistic fMRI data. Conclusions The fmrisim package holds promise for improving the design of fMRI experiments, which may facilitate both the pre-registration</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Variation across 141,456 human exomes and genomes reveals the spectrum of loss-of-function intolerance across human protein-coding genes Supplementary Information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29</h4>
          <p>Genetic variants that inactivate protein-coding genes are a powerful source of information about the phenotypic consequences of gene disruption genes critical for an organism&#39;s function will be depleted for such variants in natural populations, while non-essential genes will tolerate their accumulation. However, predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variants are enriched for annotation errors, and tend to be found at extremely low frequencies, so their analysis requires careful variant annotation and very large sample sizes. Here, we describe the aggregation of 125,748 exomes and 15,708 genomes from human sequencing studies into the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 443,769 high-confidence pLoF variants in this cohort after filtering for sequencing and annotation artifacts. Using an improved model of human mutation, we classify human protein-coding genes along a spectrum representing intolerance to inactivation, validate this classification using data from model organisms and engineered human cells, and show that it can be used to improve gene discovery power for both common and rare diseases.</p>
