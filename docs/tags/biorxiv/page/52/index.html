          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">What is the test-retest reliability of common task-fMRI measures? New empirical evidence and a meta-analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractIdentifying brain biomarkers of disease risk is a growing priority in neuroscience. The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments (N=1,008) revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC=.397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 common fMRI tasks collected in the context of the Human Connectome Project (N=45) and the Dunedin Study (N=20) were poor (ICCs=.067-.485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that common task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research. We review how this state of affairs came to be and highlight avenues for improving task-fMRI reliability.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A receptor for herbivore-associated molecular patterns mediates plant immunity, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractPlant-herbivore interactions are ubiquitous across nature and drive major agricultural losses. Inducible defense responses triggered through immune recognition aid in host plant protection; however, specific ligand-receptor pairs mediating the initial perception of herbivory remain unknown. Plants in the subtribe Phaseolinae detect herbivore-associated peptides in caterpillar oral secretions and the defined ligands are proteolytic fragments of chloroplastic ATP synthase termed inceptins. Using forward genetic mapping of inceptin-induced responses, we identify a cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein as an inceptin receptor (INR) sufficient for elicitor-induced responses and enhanced defense against armyworms (Spodoptera exigua). INR defines a receptor by which plants perceive herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and expands the paradigm of surface immune recognition to attack with mandibles.One Sentence SummaryA plant cell surface receptor directly perceives peptides associated with caterpillar herbivory.</p>

          <p>Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we show that working memory entails brain-wide switching between activity states. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1 receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2 receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Schizophrenia patients show altered network control properties, including a more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working memory representations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic screens in isogenic mammalian cell lines without single cell cloning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>Isogenic pairs of cell lines, which differ by a single genetic modification, are powerful tools for understanding gene function. Generating such pairs for mammalian cells, however, is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and impossible in some cell types. Here we present an approach to create isogenic pairs of cells and screen them with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 libraries to generate genetic interaction maps. We queried the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2L1 and MCL1, and the DNA damage repair gene PARP1, via 25 genome-wide screens across 4 cell lines. For all three genes, we identify a rich set of both expected and novel buffering and synthetic lethal interactions. Further, we compare the interactions observed in genetic space to those found when targeting these genes with small molecules and identify hits that may inform the clinical uses for these inhibitors. We anticipate that this methodology will be broadly useful to comprehensively study genes of interest across many cell types.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The effect of bioRxiv preprints on citations and altmetrics, bioRxiv, 2019-06-23</h4>
          <p>1.AbstractA potential motivation for scientists to deposit their scientific work as preprints is to enhance its citation or social impact, an effect which has been empirically observed for preprints in physics, astronomy and mathematics deposited to arXiv. In this study we assessed the citation and altmetric advantage of bioRxiv, a preprint server for the biological sciences. We retrieved metadata of all bioRxiv preprints deposited between November 2013 and December 2017, and matched them to articles that were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. Citation data from Scopus and altmetric data from &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpAltmetric.com&gt;Altmetric.com&lt;jatsext-link&gt; were used to compare citation and online sharing behaviour of bioRxiv preprints, their related journal articles, and non-deposited articles published in the same journals. We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles received a sizeable citation and altmetric advantage over non-deposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the article and its authorship. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has been subsequently published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High genetic diversity can contribute to extinction in small populations, bioRxiv, 2019-06-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractHuman-driven habitat fragmentation and loss has led to a proliferation of small and isolated plant and animal populations that may be threatened with extinction by genetic factors. The prevailing approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, which is often equated with fitness. Increasingly, this is being done using genetic rescue, where individuals from populations with high genetic diversity are translocated to small populations with high levels of inbreeding. However, the potentially negative consequences of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which only briefly recovered after genetic rescue by a migrant from the large mainland wolf population and then declined to the brink of extinction. Here, we use ecologically-motivated population genetic simulations to show that extinction risk in small populations is often increased by maximizing genetic diversity but is consistently decreased by minimizing deleterious variation. Surprisingly, we find that small populations that are founded or rescued by individuals from large populations with high genetic diversity have an elevated risk of extinction due to the high levels of recessive deleterious variation harbored by large populations. By contrast, we show that genetic rescue or founding from small or moderate-sized populations leads to decreased extinction risk due to greater purging of strongly deleterious variants. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on genetic diversity in assessing extinction risk in favor of a new view that emphasizes minimizing deleterious variation. These insights have immediate implications for managing small and isolated populations in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.</p>
