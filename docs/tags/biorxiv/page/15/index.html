          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Allelic polymorphism shapes collective phenotypes in evolving Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations, bioRxiv, 2019-05-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs by forming antibiotic resistant biofilms. Emergence of phenotypically diverse isolates within P. aeruginosa infections has previously been reported, however, the impact of heterogeneity on social behaviors is poorly understood. Here we test how diversity impacts on traits by evolving the strain PAO1 in biofilms grown in a synthetic sputum medium for 50 days. We measured social trait production and used a metagenomic approach to analyze and assess genomic changes over the duration of the evolution experiment. We found that (i) evolutionary trajectories were reproducible in independently evolving populations; (ii) over 60% of genomic diversity occurred within the first 10 days of selection. We then focused on quorum sensing (QS), a well-studied P. aeruginosa trait that is commonly mutated in strains isolated from CF lungs. We found that at the population level (i) evolution in sputum medium selected for decreased production of QS and QS-dependent traits due to accumulation of a SNP in the lasR gene; (ii) there was a significant correlation between lasR mutant frequency, the loss of protease and the 3O-C12-HSL signal, and an increase in resistance to clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics, despite no previous antibiotic exposure. Overall, our findings provide insights into the impact of allele polymorphism on the collective phenotypes of diverse P. aeruginosa populations. Further, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa population and evolutionary dynamics can impact on traits important for virulence and could also provide reasons for antibiotic resistance found in CF infections.SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of chronic infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others in the lung and become phenotypically and genotypically diverse over time. How this diversity impacts on clinically relevant traits such as virulence or antibiotic resistance has received little attention. Here we demonstrate that the accumulation and frequency of genetic variants within heterogenous P. aeruginosa populations, results in population level changes in important traits including quorum sensing and antimicrobial resistance. Our work suggests that in the future, we should consider metagenomic and metaphenotypic assessments of P. aeruginosa populations collected from CF patients, rather than focusing on single random colonies isolated from infection.</p>

          <p>SUMMARYOptical tissue transparency permits cellular and molecular investigation of complex tissues in 3D, a fundamental need in biomedical sciences. Adult human organs are particularly challenging for this approach, owing to the accumulation of dense and sturdy molecules in decades-aged human tissues. Here, we introduce SHANEL method utilizing a new tissue permeabilization approach to clear and label stiff human organs. We used SHANEL to generate the first intact transparent adult human brain and kidney, and perform 3D histology using antibodies and dyes in centimeters depth. Thereby, we revealed structural details of sclera, iris and suspensory ligament in the human eye, and the vessels and glomeruli in the human kidney. We also applied SHANEL on transgenic pig organs to map complex structures of EGFP expressing beta cells in &amp;gt;10 cm size pancreas. Overall, SHANEL is a robust and unbiased technology to chart the cellular and molecular architecture of intact large mammalian organs.Graphical Abstract&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait fig-type=figure&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=643908v1_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;Supplementary Movies of SHANEL are available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpdiscotechnologies.orgSHANEL&gt;httpdiscotechnologies.orgSHANEL&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Next-generation sequencing of double stranded RNA is greatly improved by treatment with the inexpensive denaturing reagent DMSO, bioRxiv, 2019-05-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractDouble stranded RNA (dsRNA) is the genetic material of important viruses and a key component of RNA interference-based immunity in eukaryotes. Previous studies have noted difficulties in determining the sequence of dsRNA molecules that have affected studies of immune function and estimates of viral diversity in nature. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been used to denature dsRNA prior to the reverse transcription stage to improve RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. We systematically tested the utility of DMSO to improve sequencing yield of a dsRNA virus (Φ6) in a short-read next generation sequencing platform. DMSO treatment improved sequencing read recovery by over two orders of magnitude, even when RNA and cDNA concentrations were below the limit of detection. We also tested the effects of DMSO on a mock eukaryotic viral community and found that dsRNA virus reads increased with DMSO treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that DMSO treatment does not adversely affect recovery of reads from a single-stranded RNA viral genome (Influenza ACalifornia072009). We suggest that up to 50% DMSO treatment be used prior to cDNA synthesis when samples of interest are composed of or may contain dsRNA.Data SummarySequence data was deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive (accession numbers PRJNA527100, PRJNA527101, PRJNA527098).

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Benchmarking algorithms for gene regulatory network inference from single-cell transcriptomic data, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art algorithms for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from single-cell gene expression data. We develop a systematic framework called BEELINE for this purpose. We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of GRN inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative GRN inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of AUROC and AUPRC) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining GRN inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of GRN inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them. BEELINE, which is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpgithub.commurali-groupBEELINE&gt;httpgithub.commurali-groupBEELINE&lt;jatsext-link&gt; under an open-source license, will aid in the future development of GRN inference algorithms for single-cell transcriptomic data.</p>

          <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is an essential method for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset but for large-scale scRNA-seq datasets, the computation consumes a long time and large memory space. In this work, we review the existing fast and memory-efficient PCA algorithms and implementations and evaluate their practical application to large-scale scRNA-seq dataset. Our benchmark showed that some PCA algorithms based on Krylov subspace and randomized singular value decomposition are fast, memory-efficient, and accurate than the other algorithms. Considering the difference of computational environment of users and developers, we also developed the guideline to select the appropriate PCA implementations.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DeepFly3D A deep learning-based approach for 3D limb and appendage tracking in tethered, adult Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractStudying how neural circuits orchestrate limbed behaviors requires the precise measurement of the positions of each appendage in 3-dimensional (3D) space. Deep neural networks can estimate 2-dimensional (2D) pose in freely behaving and tethered animals. However, the unique challenges associated with transforming these 2D measurements into reliable and precise 3D poses have not been addressed for small animals including the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here we present DeepFly3D, a software that infers the 3D pose of tethered, adult Drosophila—or other animals—using multiple camera images. DeepFly3D does not require manual calibration, uses pictorial structures to automatically detect and correct pose estimation errors, and uses active learning to iteratively improve performance. We demonstrate more accurate unsupervised behavioral embedding using 3D joint angles rather than commonly used 2D pose data. Thus, DeepFly3D enables the automated acquisition of behavioral measurements at an unprecedented level of resolution for a variety of biological applications.</p>
