          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">VolcanoFinder genomic scans for adaptive introgression, bioRxiv, 2019-07-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent research shows that introgression between closely-related species is an important source of adaptive alleles for a wide range of taxa. Typically, detection of adaptive introgression from genomic data relies on comparative analyses that require sequence data from both the recipient and the donor species. However, in many cases, the donor is unknown or the data is not currently available. Here, we introduce a genome-scan method—VolcanoFinder—to detect recent events of adaptive introgression using polymorphism data from the recipient species only.VolcanoFinder detects adaptive introgression sweeps from the pattern of excess intermediate-frequency polymorphism they produce in the flanking region of the genome, a pattern which appears as a volcano-shape in pairwise genetic diversity.Using coalescent theory, we derive analytical predictions for these patterns. Based on these results, we develop a composite-likelihood test to detect signatures of adaptive introgression relative to the genomic background. Simulation results show that VolcanoFinder has high statistical power to detect these signatures, even for older sweeps and for soft sweeps initiated by multiple migrant haplotypes. Finally, we implement VolcanoFinder to detect archaic introgression in European and sub-Saharan African human populations, and uncovered interesting candidates in both populations, such as TSHR in Europeans and TCHH-RPTN in Africans. We discuss their biological implications and provide guidelines for identifying and circumventing artifactual signals during empirical applications of VolcanoFinder.Author summaryThe process by which beneficial alleles are introduced into a species from a closely-related species is termed adaptive introgression. We present an analytically-tractable model for the effects of adaptive introgression on non-adaptive genetic variation in the genomic region surrounding the beneficial allele. The result we describe is a characteristic volcano-shaped pattern of increased variability that arises around the positively-selected site, and we introduce an open-source method VolcanoFinder to detect this signal in genomic data. Importantly, VolcanoFinder is a population-genetic likelihood-based approach, rather than a comparative-genomic approach, and can therefore probe genomic variation data from a single population for footprints of adaptive introgression, even from a priori unknown and possibly extinct donor species.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cross-kingdom recognition of bacterial small RNAs induces transgenerational pathogenic avoidance, bioRxiv, 2019-07-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe recently discovered that C. elegans can pass on a learned avoidance of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) to four generations of its progeny. This transgenerational inheritance is bacterial species-specific, but how C. elegans recognizes and distinguishes different bacteria and transmits this information to future generations is not apparent. Here we show that small RNAs purified from pathogenic PA14 are sufficient not only to induce avoidance of pathogens in mothers, but also to confer transgenerational inheritance of this species-specific behavior for four generations, all without direct contact with pathogenic bacteria. This behavior requires the small RNA transporters SID-1 and SID-2, RNA interference pathway components, the piRNA PiwiArgonaute pathway, a functioning germline, and TGF-β ligand daf-7 expression in the ASI sensory neuron. Our results suggest that C. elegans “reads” small RNAs expressed by pathogenic bacteria, and uses this information to induce an escape behavior that lasts for four additional generations. C. elegans may have evolved this trans-kingdom signaling system to avoid pathogens in abundant classes of bacteria in its environment and its microbiome.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome-wide association study provides new insights into the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of heart failure, bioRxiv, 2019-07-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractHeart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide1. A small proportion of HF cases are attributable to monogenic cardiomyopathies and existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded only limited insights, leaving the observed heritability of HF largely unexplained2–4. We report the largest GWAS meta-analysis of HF to-date, comprising 47,309 cases and 930,014 controls. We identify 12 independent variant associations with HF at 11 genomic loci, all of which demonstrate one or more associations with coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation, or reduced left ventricular function suggesting shared genetic aetiology. Expression quantitative trait analysis of non-CAD-associated loci implicate genes involved in cardiac development (MYOZ1, SYNPO2L), protein homeostasis (BAG3), and cellular senescence (CDKN1A). Using Mendelian randomisation analysis we provide new evidence supporting previously equivocal causal roles for several HF risk factors identified in observational studies, and demonstrate CAD-independent effects for atrial fibrillation, body mass index, hypertension and triglycerides. These findings extend our knowledge of the genes and pathways underlying HF and may inform the development of new therapeutic approaches.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A single cell framework for multi-omic analysis of disease identifies malignant regulatory signatures in mixed phenotype acute leukemia, bioRxiv, 2019-07-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn order to identify the molecular determinants of human diseases, such as cancer, that arise from a diverse range of tissue, it is necessary to accurately distinguish normal and pathogenic cellular programs.1–3Here we present a novel approach for single-cell multi-omic deconvolution of healthy and pathological molecular signatures within phenotypically heterogeneous malignant cells. By first creating immunophenotypic, transcriptomic and epigenetic single-cell maps of hematopoietic development from healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, we identify cancer-specific transcriptional and chromatin signatures from single cells in a cohort of mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) clinical samples. MPALs are a high-risk subtype of acute leukemia characterized by a heterogeneous malignant cell population expressing both myeloid and lymphoid lineage-specific markers.4, 5Our results reveal widespread heterogeneity in the pathogenetic gene regulatory and expression programs across patients, yet relatively consistent changes within patients even across malignant cells occupying diverse portions of the hematopoietic lineage. An integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenetic maps identifies 91,601 putative gene-regulatory interactions and classifies a number of transcription factors that regulate leukemia specific genes, includingRUNX1-linked regulatory elements proximal toCD69. This work provides a template for integrative, multi-omic analysis for the interpretation of pathogenic molecular signatures in the context of developmental origin.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assessing the analytical validity of SNP-chips for detecting very rare pathogenic variants implications for direct-to-consumer genetic testing, bioRxiv, 2019-07-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTObjectivesTo determine the analytical validity of SNP-chips for genotyping very rare genetic variants.DesignRetrospective study using data from two publicly available resources, the UK Biobank and the Personal Genome Project.SettingResearch biobanks and direct-to-consumer genetic testing in the UK and USA.Participants49,908 individuals recruited to UK Biobank, and 21 individuals who purchased consumer genetic tests and shared their data online via the Personal Genomes Project.Main outcome measuresWe assessed the analytical validity of genotypes from SNP-chips (index test) with sequencing data (reference standard). We evaluated the genotyping accuracy of the SNP-chips and split the results by variant frequency. We went on to select rare pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes as an exemplar for detailed analysis of clinically-actionable variants in UK Biobank, and assessed BRCA-related cancers (breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic) in participants using cancer registry data.ResultsSNP-chip genotype accuracy is high overall; sensitivity, specificity and precision are all &amp;gt;99% for 108,574 common variants directly genotyped by the UK Biobank SNP-chips. However, the likelihood of a true positive result reduces dramatically with decreasing variant frequency; for variants with a frequency &amp;lt;0.001% in UK Biobank the precision is very low and only 16% of 4,711 variants from the SNP-chips confirm with sequencing data. Results are similar for SNP-chip data from the Personal Genomes Project, and 2021 individuals have at least one rare pathogenic variant that has been incorrectly genotyped. For pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the overall performance metrics of the SNP-chips in UK Biobank are sensitivity 34.6%, specificity 98.3% and precision 4.2%. Rates of BRCA-related cancers in individuals in UK Biobank with a positive SNP-chip result are similar to age-matched controls (OR 1.28, P=0.07, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.67), while sequence-positive individuals have a significantly increased risk (OR 3.73, P=3.5×10−12, 95% CI 2.57 to 5.40).ConclusionSNP-chips are extremely unreliable for genotyping very rare pathogenic variants and should not be used to guide health decisions without validation.SUMMARY BOXSection 1 What is already known on this topicSNP-chips are an accurate and affordable method for genotyping common genetic variants across the genome. They are often used by direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies and research studies, but there several case reports suggesting they perform poorly for genotyping rare genetic variants when compared with sequencing.Section 2 What this study addsOur study confirms that SNP-chips are highly inaccurate for genotyping rare, clinically-actionable variants. Using large-scale SNP-chip and sequencing data from UK Biobank, we show that SNP-chips have a very low precision of &amp;lt;16% for detecting very rare variants (i.e. the majority of variants with population frequency of &amp;lt;0.001% are false positives). We observed a similar performance in a small sample of raw SNP-chip data from DTC genetic tests. Very rare variants assayed using SNP-chips should not be used to guide health decisions without validation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Structures of virus-like capsids formed by the Drosophila neuronal Arc proteins, bioRxiv, 2019-07-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe neuronal protein Arc is a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity. Arc originated in tetrapods and flies through domestication of retrotransposon Gag genes. Recent studies have suggested that Arc mediates intercellular mRNA transfer and like Gag, can form capsid-like structures. Here we report that Drosophila proteins dArc1 and dArc2 assemble virus-like capsids. We determine the capsid structures to 2.8 Å and 3.7 Å resolution, respectively, finding similarity to capsids of retroviruses and retrotransposons. Differences between dArc1 and dArc2 capsids, including the presence of a structured zinc-finger pair in dArc1, are consistent with differential RNA-binding specificity. Our data support a model in which ancestral capsid-forming and RNA-binding properties of Arc remain under positive selection pressure and have been repurposed to function in neuronal signalling.</p>
