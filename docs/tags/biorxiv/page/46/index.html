          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">ARMOR an Automated Reproducible MOdular workflow for preprocessing and differential analysis of RNA-seq data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe extensive generation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data in the last decade has resulted in a myriad of specialized software for its analysis. Each software module typically targets a specific step within the analysis pipeline, making it necessary to join several of them to get a single cohesive workflow. Multiple software programs automating this procedure have been proposed, but often lack modularity, transparency or flexibility. We present ARMOR, which performs an end-to-end RNA-seq data analysis, from raw read files, via quality checks, alignment and quantification, to differential expression testing, geneset analysis and browser-based exploration of the data. ARMOR is implemented using the Snakemake workflow management system and leverages conda environments; Bioconductor objects are generated to facilitate downstream analysis, ensuring seamless integration with many R packages. The workflow is easily implemented by cloning the GitHub repository, replacing the supplied input and reference files and editing a configuration file. Although we have selected the tools currently included in ARMOR, the setup is modular and alternative tools can be easily integrated.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Frequent birth of de novo genes in the compact yeast genome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractEvidence has accumulated that some genes originate directly from previously non-genic sequences, or de novo, rather than by the duplication or fusion of existing genes. However, how de novo genes emerge and eventually become functional is largely unknown. Here we perform the first study on de novo genes that uses transcriptomics data from eleven different yeast species, all grown identically in both rich media and in oxidative stress conditions. The genomes of these species are densely-packed with functional elements, leaving little room for the co-option of genomic sequences into new transcribed loci. Despite this, we find that at least 213 transcripts (~5%) have arisen de novo in the past 20 million years of evolution of baker’s yeast-or approximately 10 new transcripts every million years. Nearly half of the total newly expressed sequences are generated from regions in which both DNA strands are used as templates for transcription, explaining the apparent contradiction between the limited ‘empty’ genomic space and high rate of de novo gene birth. In addition, we find that 40% of these de novo transcripts are actively translated and that at least a fraction of the encoded proteins are likely to be under purifying selection. This study shows that even in very highly compact genomes, de novo transcripts are continuously generated and can give rise to new functional protein-coding genes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The genetic architecture of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage, bioRxiv, 2019-03-13</h4>
          <p>Miscarriage is a common complex trait that affects 10-25% of clinically confirmed pregnancies1,2. Here we present the first large-scale genetic association analyses with 69,118 cases from five different ancestries for sporadic miscarriage and 750 cases of European ancestry for recurrent miscarriage, and up to 359,469 female controls. We identify one genome-wide significant association on chromosome 13 (rs146350366, minor allele frequency (MAF) 1.2%, Pmeta=3.2× -8 (CI) 1.2-1.6) for sporadic miscarriage in our European ancestry meta-analysis (50,060 cases and 174,109 controls), located near FGF9 involved in pregnancy maintenance3 and progesterone production4. Additionally, we identified three genome-wide significant associations for recurrent miscarriage, including a signal on chromosome 9 (rs7859844, MAF=6.4%, Pmeta=1.3× -8 in controlling extravillous trophoblast motility5. We further investigate the genetic architecture of miscarriage with biobank-scale Mendelian randomization, heritability and, genetic correlation analyses. Our results implicate that miscarriage etiopathogenesis is partly driven by genetic variation related to gonadotropin regulation, placental biology and progesterone production.</p>

          <p>Animal models are an integral part of the drug development and evaluation process. However, they are unsurprisingly imperfect reflections of humans, and the extent and nature of many immunological differences are unknown. With the rise of targeted and biological therapeutics, it is increasingly important that we understand the molecular differences in immunological behavior of humans and model organisms. Thus, we profiled a large number of healthy humans, along with three of the model organisms most similar to humans rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys; and the most widely used mammalian model mice. Using cross-species, universal phenotyping and signaling panels, we measured immune cell signaling responses to an array of 15 stimuli using CyTOF mass cytometry. We found numerous instances of different cellular phenotypes and immune signaling events occurring within and between species with likely effects on evaluation of therapeutics, and detail three examples (double-positive T cell frequency and signaling; granulocyte response to Bacillus anthracis antigen; and B cell subsets). We also explore the correlation of herpes simian B virus serostatus on the immune profile.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A comprehensive examination of Nanopore native RNA sequencing for characterization of complex transcriptomes, bioRxiv, 2019-03-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractA platform for highly parallel direct sequencing of native RNA strands was recently described by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT); in order to assess overall performance in transcript-level investigations, the technology was applied for sequencing sets of synthetic transcripts as well as a yeast transcriptome. However, despite initial efforts it remains crucial to further investigate characteristics of ONT native RNA sequencing when applied to much more complex transcriptomes. Here we thus undertook extensive native RNA sequencing of polyA&#43; RNA from two human cell lines, and thereby analysed ~5.2 million aligned native RNA reads which consisted of a total of ~4.6 billion bases. To enable informative comparisons, we also performed relevant ONT direct cDNA- and Illumina-sequencing. We find that while native RNA sequencing does enable some of the anticipated advantages, key unexpected aspects hamper its performance, most notably the quite frequent inability to obtain full-length transcripts from single reads, as well as difficulties to unambiguously infer their true transcript of origin. While characterising issues that need to be addressed when investigating more complex transcriptomes, our study highlights that with some defined improvements, native RNA sequencing could be an important addition to the mammalian transcriptomics toolbox.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Best practices for making reliable inferences from citizen science data case study using eBird to estimate species distributions, bioRxiv, 2019-03-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractCitizen science data are valuable for addressing a wide range of ecological research questions, and there has been a rapid increase in the scope and volume of data available. However, data from large-scale citizen science projects typically present a number of challenges that can inhibit robust ecological inferences. These challenges include species bias, spatial bias, variation in effort, and variation in observer skill.To demonstrate key challenges in analysing citizen science data, we use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a large semi-structured citizen science project. We estimate three widely applied metrics for describing species distributions encounter rate, occupancy probability, and relative abundance. For each method, we outline approaches for data processing and modelling that are suitable for using citizen science data for estimating species distributions.Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from citizen science data. The largest gains in model performance were achieved with two key processes 1) the use of complete checklists rather than presence-only data, and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Including these covariates accounted for heterogeneity in detectability and reporting, and resulted in substantial differences in predicted distributions. The data processing and analytical steps we outlined led to improved model performance across a range of sample sizes.When using citizen science data it is imperative to carefully consider the appropriate data processing and analytical procedures required to address the bias and variation. Here, we describe the consequences and utility of applying our suggested approach to semi-structured citizen science data to estimate species distributions. The methods we have outlined are also likely to improve other forms of inference and will enable researchers to conduct robust analyses and harness the vast ecological knowledge that exists within citizen science data.</p>
