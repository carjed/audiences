          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Conserved cell types with divergent features between human and mouse cortex, bioRxiv, 2018-08-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractElucidating the cellular architecture of the human neocortex is central to understanding our cognitive abilities and susceptibility to disease. Here we applied single nucleus RNA-sequencing to perform a comprehensive analysis of cell types in the middle temporal gyrus of human cerebral cortex. We identify a highly diverse set of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal types that are mostly sparse, with excitatory types being less layer-restricted than expected. Comparison to a similar mouse cortex single cell RNA-sequencing dataset revealed a surprisingly well-conserved cellular architecture that enables matching of homologous types and predictions of human cell type properties. Despite this general conservation, we also find extensive differences between homologous human and mouse cell types, including dramatic alterations in proportions, laminar distributions, gene expression, and morphology. These species-specific features emphasize the importance of directly studying human brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-06</h4>
          <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome-wide CRISPR Screens in Primary Human T Cells Reveal Key Regulators of Immune Function, bioRxiv, 2018-08-03</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYHuman T cells are central effectors of immunity and cancer immunotherapy. CRISPR-based functional studies in T cells could prioritize novel targets for drug development and improve the design of genetically reprogrammed cell-based therapies. However, large-scale CRISPR screens have been challenging in primary human cells. We developed a new method, sgRNA lentiviral infection with Cas9 protein electroporation (SLICE), to identify regulators of stimulation responses in primary human T cells. Genome-wide loss-of-function screens identified essential T cell receptor signaling components and genes that negatively tune proliferation following stimulation. Targeted ablation of individual candidate genes validated hits and identified perturbations that enhanced cancer cell killing. SLICE coupled with single-cell RNA-Seq revealed signature stimulation-response gene programs altered by key genetic perturbations. SLICE genome-wide screening was also adaptable to identify mediators of immunosuppression, revealing genes controlling response to adenosine signaling. The SLICE platform enables unbiased discovery and characterization of functional gene targets in primary cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Molecular recording of mammalian embryogenesis, bioRxiv, 2018-08-03</h4>
          <p>Understanding the emergence of complex multicellular organisms from single totipotent cells, or ontogenesis, represents a foundational question in biology. The study of mammalian development is particularly challenging due to the difficulty of monitoring embryos in utero, the variability of progenitor field sizes, and the indeterminate relationship between the generation of uncommitted progenitors and their progression to subsequent stages. Here, we present a flexible, high information, multi-channel molecular recorder with a single cell (sc) readout and apply it as an evolving lineage tracer to define a mouse cell fate map from fertilization through gastrulation. By combining lineage information with scRNA-seq profiles, we recapitulate canonical developmental relationships between different tissue types and reveal an unexpected transcriptional convergence of endodermal cells from extra-embryonic and embryonic origins, illustrating how lineage information complements scRNA-seq to define cell types. Finally, we apply our cell fate map to estimate the number of embryonic progenitor cells and the degree of asymmetric partitioning within the pluripotent epiblast during specification. Our approach enables massively parallel, high-resolution recording of lineage and other information in mammalian systems to facilitate a quantitative framework for describing developmental processes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pooled optical screens in human cells, bioRxiv, 2018-08-03</h4>
          <p>Large-scale genetic screens play a key role in the systematic discovery of genes underlying cellular phenotypes. Pooling of genetic perturbations greatly increases screening throughput, but has so far been limited to screens of enrichments defined by cell fitness and flow cytometry, or to comparatively low-throughput single cell gene expression profiles. Although microscopy is a rich source of spatial and temporal information about mammalian cells, high-content imaging screens have been restricted to much less efficient arrayed formats. Here, we introduce an optical method to link perturbations and their phenotypic outcomes at the single-cell level in a pooled setting. Barcoded perturbations are read out by targeted in situ sequencing following image-based phenotyping. We apply this technology to screen a focused set of 952 genes across &amp;gt;3 million cells for involvement in NF-κB activation by imaging the translocation of RelA (p65) to the nucleus, recovering 20 known pathway components and 3 novel candidate positive regulators of IL-1β and TNFα-stimulated immune responses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reaction times and other skewed distributions problems with the mean and the median, bioRxiv, 2018-08-03</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTTo summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that “sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.” Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median’s bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation. All the code and data to reproduce the figures and analyses in the article are available online.</p>
