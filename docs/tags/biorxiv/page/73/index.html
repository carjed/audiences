          <p>1.Executive SummaryThis survey and data analysis were conducted by the European Network of Postdoctoral Associations (ENPA) with the aim of assessing the current research and work conditions, aspirations and support received by postdoctoral researchers working in Europe.The Results section is structured into three main parts. The first one describes the study sample of European postdoctoral researchers, including participants’ demographics, funding sources and income, research outputs, and teaching opportunities. The second section focuses on their professional aspirations and institutional support provided. The third part describes the level of engagement of postdoctoral researchers and their institutions in working towards better research conditions and career development, and what initiatives are emerging within this community.Our Conclusions section pulls together this comprehensive analysis, highlighting some of the most concerning issues currently affecting postdoctoral researchers in Europe. We also make a number of recommendations that would significantly improve the career expectations and aspirations of postdoctoral researchers. These are listed below.Conclusions and recommendations&lt;jatslist list-type=order&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Longer postdoctoral periods in Southern Europe despite higher publication metricsRecommendation Institutions in Southern Europe should develop clear criteria to support postdoctoral researchers’ career progression.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Southern and Eastern Europe pay the lowest salaries and have the lowest number of foreign postdoctoral researchersRecommendation The salary differences across European countries should be addressed as this could be a barrier to mobility and knowledge exchange from higher to lower pay regions.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Lack of access to funding is a significant concern of postdoctoral researchersRecommendation Discrepancies in access to funding should be minimized across the different European areas.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Postdoctoral researchers in Europe work longer hours than required by contractRecommendation The culture of overwork in the research environment should be addressed in order to protect researchers against the risks associated with long hours at work.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;The majority of full-time postdoctoral work contracts includes an exclusivity clauseRecommendation Inclusion of exclusivity clauses in contracts for postdoctoral researchers should be optional in order to allow them to enhance their employability outside academia.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Postdoctoral researchers’ career development is poorly supported by their institutionsRecommendation Postdoctoral researchers’ career prospects and career management should be much more supported by institutions in coordination with postdoctoral associations.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Lack of postdoctoral representation in governance is linked to unclear institutional duties and rightsRecommendation Institutional governance bodies should include postdoctoral researcher representatives. This would ensure that the views of this vital staff group are heard, as well as making postdoctoral researchers feel more engaged with their own institutions. A flexible and proactive communication strategy at the institution and research group level should be developed, taking into account the sometimes transient nature of postdoctoral researchers’ posts.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Researchers show higher engagement with their local postdoctoral associations than with workers’ unionsRecommendation Postdoctoral associations are an essential way to advocate for postdoctoral researchers at the governance level. Institutions should engage with, promote and support the work of postdoctoral associations.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Selection for antibiotic resistance is reduced when embedded in a natural microbial community Supplemental Figure 1-4, bioRxiv, 2019-01-24</h4>
          <p>Antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the most pressing, global threats to public health. In single-species experiments selection for antibiotic resistance occurs at very low antibiotic concentrations. However, it is unclear how far these findings can be extrapolated to natural environments, where species are embedded within complex communities. We competed isogenic strains of Escherichia coli, differing exclusively in a single chromosomal resistance determinant, in the presence and absence of a pig fecal microbial community across a gradient of antibiotic concentration for two relevant antibiotics gentamicin and kanamycin. We show that the minimal selective concentration was increased by more than one order of magnitude for both antibiotics when embedded in the community. We identified two general mechanisms were responsible for the increase in minimal selective concentration an increase in the cost of resistance and a protective effect of the community for the susceptible phenotype. These findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution and selection of antibiotic resistance, and can inform future risk assessment efforts on antibiotic concentrations.</p>

          <p>Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its cleavage product beta-amyloid are widely believed to be key players in the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). However, the distribution of amyloid deposits in the brain does not correlate well with disease progression. Therefore, it seemed possible that APP metabolites other than beta-amyloid might make a strong contribution to AD pathology. We developed a sensitive assay adapted to the detection of C99, an intermediate in the conversion of APP to beta-amyloid. Brain tissue sections were obtained from patients suffering from sporadic AD and non-demented controls. Our results demonstrate that C99 levels, but not Abeta levels, correlate with the degree of vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in patients suffering from AD.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DNA methylation directs polycomb-dependent 3D genome re- organisation in naive pluripotency Supplementary information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-23</h4>
          <p>The DNA hypomethylation that occurs when embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are directed to the ground state of naive pluripotency by culturing in 2i conditions results in redistribution of polycomb (H3K27me3) away from its target loci. Here we demonstrate that 3D genome organisation is also altered in 2i. We found chromatin decompaction at polycomb target loci as well as loss of long-range polycomb interactions. By preventing DNA hypomethylation during the transition to the ground-state, we are able to restore the H3K27me3 distribution, and polycomb-mediated 3D genome organisation that is characteristic of primed ESCs grown in serum, to ESCs in 2i. However, these cells retain the functional characteristics of 2i ground state ESCs. Our findings demonstrate the central role of DNA methylation in shaping major aspects of 3D genome organisation but caution against assuming causal roles for the epigenome and 3D genome in gene regulation and function in ESCs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phase separation provides a mechanism to reduce noise in cells Supplementary text, bioRxiv, 2019-01-23</h4>
          <p>A central problem in cellular control is how cells cope with the inherent noise in gene expression. Although transcriptional and posttranscriptional feedback mechanisms can suppress noise, they are often slow, and cannot explain how cells buffer acute fluctuations. Here, by using a physical model that links fluctuations in protein concentration to the theory of phase separation, we show that liquid droplets can act as fast and effective buffers for gene expression noise. We confirm our theory experimentally using an engineered phase separating protein that forms liquid-like compartments in mammalian cells. These data suggest a novel role of phase separation in biological information processing.</p>

          <p>Malaria parasites adopt a remarkable variety of morphological life stages as they transition through multiple mammalian host and mosquito vector environments. Here we profile the single-cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual parasites, deriving the first high-resolution transcriptional atlas of the entire Plasmodium berghei life cycle. We then use our atlas to precisely define developmental stages of single cells from three different human malaria parasite species, including parasites isolated directly from infected individuals. The Malaria Cell Atlas provides both a comprehensive view of gene usage in a complex eukaryotic parasite and an open access reference data set for the study of malaria parasites.</p>
