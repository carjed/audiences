          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of pond water as a tool to survey conservation and management priority mammals, bioRxiv, 2019-02-11</h4>
          <p>Abstract&lt;jatslist list-type=order&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is largely used to survey aquatic communities, but can also provide data on terrestrial taxa utilising aquatic habitats. However, the entry, dispersal, and detection of terrestrial species’ DNA within waterbodies is understudied.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;We evaluated eDNA metabarcoding of pond water for monitoring semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, and arboreal mammals, and examined spatiotemporal variation in mammal eDNA signals using experiments in captive and wild conditions.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;We selected nine focal species of conservation and management concern European water vole, European otter, Eurasian beaver, European hedgehog, European badger, red deer, Eurasian lynx, red squirrel, and European pine marten. We hypothesised that eDNA signals (i.e. proportional read counts) would be stronger for semi-aquatic than terrestrial species, and at sites where mammals exhibited behaviours (e.g. swimming, urination). We tested this by sampling waterbodies in enclosures of captive focal species at specific sites where behaviours had been observed (‘directed’ sampling) and at equidistant intervals along the shoreline (‘stratified’ sampling). We then surveyed natural ponds (N = 6) where focal species were present using stratified water sampling, camera traps, and field signs. eDNA samples were metabarcoded using vertebrate-specific primers.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;All focal species were detected in captivity. eDNA signal strength did not differ between directed and stratified samples across or within species, between species lifestyles (i.e. semi-aquatic, ground-dwelling, arboreal), or according to behaviours. Therefore, eDNA was evenly distributed within artificial waterbodies. Conversely, eDNA was unevenly distributed in natural ponds. eDNA metabarcoding, camera trapping, and field signs detected beaver, red deer, and roe deer. Badger and red fox were recorded with cameras and field signs, but not eDNA metabarcoding. However, eDNA metabarcoding detected small mammals missed by cameras and field signs, e.g. water vole. Terrestrial mammal eDNA signals were weaker and detected in fewer samples than semi-aquatic mammal eDNA signals.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;eDNA metabarcoding has potential for inclusion in mammal monitoring schemes by enabling large-scale, multi-species distribution assessment for priority and difficult to survey species, and could provide early indication of range expansions or contractions. However, eDNA surveys need high spatiotemporal resolution and metabarcoding biases require further investigation before this tool is routinely implemented.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">THINGS A database of 1,854 object concepts and more than 26,000 naturalistic object images, bioRxiv, 2019-02-11</h4>
          <p>In recent years, the use of a large number of object concepts and naturalistic object images has been growing enormously in cognitive neuroscience research. Classical databases of object concepts are based mostly on a manually-curated set of concepts. Further, databases of naturalistic object images typically consist of single images of objects cropped from their background, or a large number of uncontrolled naturalistic images of varying quality, requiring elaborate manual image curation. Here we provide a set of 1,854 diverse object concepts sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. Using these object concepts, we conducted a large-scale web image search to compile a database of 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of those objects, with 12 or more object images per concept and all images cropped to square size. Using crowdsourcing, we provide higher-level category membership for the 27 most common categories and validate them by relating them to representations in a semantic embedding derived from large text corpora. Finally, by feeding images through a deep convolutional neural network, we demonstrate that they exhibit high selectivity for different object concepts, while at the same time preserving variability of different object images within each concept. Together, the THINGS database provides a rich resource of object concepts and object images and offers a tool for both systematic and large-scale naturalistic research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tissue structure accelerates evolution premalignant sweeps precede neutral expansion, bioRxiv, 2019-02-11</h4>
          <p>Cancer has been hypothesized to be a caricature of the renewal process of the tissue of origin arising from (and maintained by) small subpopulations capable of continuous growth1. The strong influence of the tissue structure has been convincingly demonstrated in intestinal cancers where adenomas grow by the fission of stem-cell-maintained glands influenced by early expression of abnormal cell mobility in cancer progenitors2, 3. So-called “born to be bad” tumors arise from progenitors which may already possess the necessary driver mutations for malignancy4, 5 and metastasis6. These tumors subsequently evolve neutrally, thereby maximizing intratumoral heterogeneity and increasing the probability of therapeutic resistance. These findings have been nuanced by the advent of multi-region sequencing, which uses spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation among competing tumor cell populations to shed light on the mode of tumor evolution (neutral or Darwinian) and also the tempo4, 7–11. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model12–16) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This model approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity competition for space. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Driver acquisition during the Darwinian precancerous stage may be accelerated en route to neutral evolution by the combination of two factors spatial constraints and limited cellular mixing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Socru Typing of genome level order and orientation in bacteria, bioRxiv, 2019-02-10</h4>
          <p>Genome rearrangements occur in bacteria between repeat sequences and impact growth and gene expression. Homologous recombination can occur between ribosomal operons, which are found in multiple copies in many bacteria. Inversion between indirect repeats and excisiontranslocation between direct repeats enable structural genome rearrangement. To identify what these rearrangements are by sequencing, reads of several thousand bases are required to span the ribosomal operons. With long read sequencing aiding the routine generation of complete bacterial assemblies, we have developed socru, a typing method for the order and orientation of genome fragments between ribosomal operons, defined against species-specific baselines. It allows for a single identifier to convey the order and orientation of genome level structure and 434 of the most common bacterial species are supported. Additionally, socru can be used to identify large scale misassemblies. Availability and implementation Socru is written in Python 3, runs on Linux and OSX systems and is available under the open source license GNU GPL 3 from httpsgithub.comquadram-institute-biosciencesocru.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Object Detection Networks and Augmented Reality for Cellular Detection in Fluorescence Microscopy Acquisition and Analysis, bioRxiv, 2019-02-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn this paper we demonstrate the application of object detection networks for the classification and localization of cells in fluorescence microscopy. We benchmark two leading object detection algorithms across multiple challenging 2-D microscopy datasets as well as develop and demonstrate an algorithm which can localize and image cells in 3-D, in real-time. Furthermore, we exploit the fast processing of these algorithms and develop a simple and effective Augmented Reality (AR) system for fluorescence microscopy systems. Object detection networks are well-known high performance networks famously applied to the task of identifying and localizing objects in photography images. Here we show their application and efficiency for localizing cells in fluorescence microscopy images. Object detection algorithms are typically trained on many thousands of images, which can be prohibitive within the biological sciences due to the cost of imaging and annotating large amounts of data. Through taking different cell types and assays as an example, we show that with some careful considerations it is possible to achieve very high performance with datasets with as few as 26 images present. Using our approach, it is possible for relatively non-skilled users to automate detection of cell classes with a variety of appearances and enable new avenues for automation of conventionally manual fluorescence microscopy acquisition pipelines.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Where do our graduates go? A toolkit for retrospective and ongoing career outcomes data collection for biomedical PhD students and postdoctoral scholars, bioRxiv, 2019-02-09</h4>
          <p>Universities are at long last undertaking efforts to collect and disseminate information about student career outcomes, after decades of calls to action. Organizations such as Rescuing Biomedical Research and Future of Research brought this issue to the forefront of graduate education, and the second Future of Biomedical Graduate and Postdoctoral Training conference (FOBGAPT2) featured the collection of career outcomes data in its final recommendations, published in this journal (Hitchcock et al., 2017). More recently, 26 institutions assembled as the Coalition for Next Generation Life Science, committing to ongoing collection and dissemination of career data for both graduate and postdoc alumni. A few individual institutions have shared snapshots of the data in peer-reviewed publications (Mathur et al., 2018; Silva, des Jarlais, Lindstaedt, Rotman, Watkins, 2016) and on websites. As more and more institutions take up this call to action, they will now be looking for tools, protocols, and best practices for ongoing career outcomes data collection, management, and dissemination. Here, we describe UCSF&#39;s experiences in conducting a retrospective study, and in institutionalizing a methodology for annual data collection and dissemination. We describe and share all tools we have developed, and we provide calculations of the time and resources required to accomplish both retrospective studies and annual updates. We also include broader recommendations for implementation at your own institutions, increasing the feasibility of this endeavor.</p>
