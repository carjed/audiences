          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Muscle fiber hypertrophy in response to 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training in trained young men is largely attributed to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTCellular adaptations that occur during skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to high-volume resistance training are not well-characterized. Therefore, we sought to explore how actin, myosin, sarcoplasmic protein, mitochondrial, and glycogen concentrations were altered in individuals that exhibited mean skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) hypertrophy following 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training. Thirty-one previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a &#43;23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p&amp;lt;0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p&amp;lt;0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, both myosin and actin concentrations decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p&amp;lt;0.05). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p&amp;lt;0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. &amp;lt;0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value &amp;lt;0.05) a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins). At W7, sarcoplasmic protein concentrations remained higher than PRE (&#43;66%, p&amp;lt;0.05), and both actin and myosin concentrations remained lower than PRE (~−50%, p&amp;lt;0.05). These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation. Interestingly, these effects seem to persist up to 8 days following training.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The mutational landscape of a prion-like domain, bioRxiv, 2019-04-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecific insoluble protein aggregates are the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases1–5. For example, cytoplasmic aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are observed in 97% of cases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)6,7. However, it is still unclear for ALS and other diseases whether it is the insoluble aggregates or other forms of the mutated proteins that cause these diseases that are actually toxic to cells8–13. Here we address this question for TDP-43 by systematically mutating14 the protein and quantifying the effects on cellular toxicity. We generated &amp;gt;50,000 mutations in the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PRD) and observed that changes in hydrophobicity and aggregation potential are highly predictive of changes in toxicity. Surprisingly, however, increased hydrophobicity and cytoplasmic aggregation actually reduce cellular toxicity. Mutations have their strongest effects in a central region of the PRD, with variants that increase toxicity promoting the formation of more dynamic liquid-like condensates. The genetic interactions in double mutants reveal that specific structures exist in this ‘unstructured’ region in vivo. Our results demonstrate that deep mutagenesis is a powerful approach for probing the sequence-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins as well as their in vivo structural conformations. Moreover, we show that aggregation of TDP-43 is not harmful but actually protects cells, most likely by titrating the protein away from a toxic liquid-like phase.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cohesin disrupts polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractHow chromosome organisation is related to genome function remains poorly understood. Cohesin, loop-extrusion, and CTCF have been proposed to create structures called topologically associating domains (TADs) to regulate gene expression. Here, we examine chromosome conformation in embryonic stem cells lacking cohesin and find as in other cell types that cohesin is required to create TADs and regulate AB compartmentalisation. However, in the absence of cohesin we identify a series of long-range chromosomal interactions that persist. These correspond to regions of the genome occupied by the polycomb repressive system, depend on PRC1, and we discover that cohesin counteracts these interactions. This disruptive activity is independent of CTCF and TADs, and regulates gene repression by the polycomb system. Therefore, in contrast to the proposal that cohesin creates structure in chromosomes, we discover a new role for cohesin in disrupting polycomb-dependent chromosome interactions to regulate gene expression.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">MARGO (Massively Automated Real-time GUI for Object-tracking), a platform for high-throughput ethology, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractFast object tracking in real time allows convenient tracking of very large numbers of animals and closed-loop experiments that control stimuli for multiple animals in parallel. We developed MARGO, a real-time animal tracking suite for custom behavioral experiments. We demonstrated that MARGO can rapidly and accurately track large numbers of animals in parallel over very long timescales. We incorporated control of peripheral hardware, and implemented a flexible software architecture for defining new experimental routines. These features enable closed-loop delivery of stimuli to many individuals simultaneously. We highlight MARGO’s ability to coordinate tracking and hardware control with two custom behavioral assays (measuring phototaxis and optomotor response) and one optogenetic operant conditioning assay. There are currently several open source animal trackers. MARGO’s strengths are 1) robustness, 2) high throughput, 3) flexible control of hardware and 4) real-time closed-loop control of sensory and optogenetic stimuli, all of which are optimized for large-scale experimentation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single Nucleotide Mapping of the Locally Accessible Trait Space in Yeast Reveals Pareto Fronts that Constrain Initial Adaptation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractTradeoffs constrain the improvement of performance of multiple traits simultaneously. Such tradeoffs define Pareto fronts, which represent a set of optimal individuals that cannot be improved in any one trait without reducing performance in another. Surprisingly, experimental evolution often yields genotypes with improved performance in all measured traits, perhaps indicating an absence of tradeoffs at least in the short-term. Here we densely sample adaptive mutations in S. cerevisiae to ask whether first-step adaptive mutations result in tradeoffs during the growth cycle. We isolated thousands of adaptive clones evolved under carefully chosen conditions and quantified their performances in each part of the growth cycle. We too find that some first-step adaptive mutations can improve all traits to a modest extent. However, our dense sampling allowed us to identify tradeoffs and establish the existence of Pareto fronts between fermentation and respiration, and between respiration and stationary phases. Moreover, we establish that no single mutation in the ancestral genome can circumvent the detected tradeoffs. Finally, we sequenced hundreds of these adaptive clones, revealing novel targets of adaptation and defining the genetic basis of the identified tradeoffs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">ezTrack An open-source video analysis pipeline for the investigation of animal behavior, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractTracking small animal behavior by video is one of the most common tasks in the fields of neuroscience and psychology. Although commercial software exists for the execution of this task, commercial software often presents enormous cost to the researcher, and can also entail purchasing specific hardware setups that are not only expensive but lack adaptability. Moreover, the inaccessibility of the code underlying this software renders them inflexible. Alternatively, available open source options frequently require extensive model training and can be challenging for those inexperienced with programming. Here we present an open source and platform independent set of behavior analysis pipelines using interactive Python (iPythonJupyter Notebook) that researchers with no prior programming experience can use. Two modules are described. One module can be used for the positional analysis of an individual animal across a session (i.e., location tracking), amenable to a wide range of behavioral tasks including conditioned place preference, water maze, light-dark box, open field, and elevated plus maze, to name but a few. A second module is described for the analysis of conditioned freezing behavior. For both modules, a range of interactive plots and visualizations are available to confirm that chosen parameters produce results that conform to the user’s approval. In addition, batch processing tools for the fast analysis of multiple videos is provided, and frame-by-frame output makes aligning the data with neural recording data simple. Lastly, options for cropping video frames to mitigate the influence of fiberopticelectrophysiology cables, analyzing specified portions of time in a video, and defining regions of interest, can be implemented with ease.</p>
