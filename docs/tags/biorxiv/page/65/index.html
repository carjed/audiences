          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rotary substates of mitochondrial ATP synthase reveal the basis of flexible F1-Fo coupling, bioRxiv, 2019-02-07</h4>
          <p>F1Fo-ATP synthases play a central role in cellular metabolism, making the energy of the proton-motive force across a membrane available for a large number of energy-consuming processes. We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 Å resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30° of each 120° primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ringa-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases. We identify the previously unknown ASA10 subunit and present complete de novo atomic models of subunits ASA1-10, which make up the two interlinked peripheral stalks that stabilize the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer.</p>

          <p>The genome versus experience, or Nature versus Nurture, debate has dominated our understanding of individual behavioral variation. A third factor, namely variation in complex behavior potentially due to non-heritable developmental noise in brain development, has been largely ignored. Using the Drosophila vinegar fly we demonstrate a causal link between variation in brain wiring due to developmental noise, and behavioral individuality. A population of visual system neurons called DCNs shows non-heritable, inter-individual variation in rightleft wiring asymmetry, and control object orientation in freely walking flies. We show that DCN wiring asymmetry predicts individual object responses the greater the asymmetry, the better the individual orients. Silencing DCNs abolishes correlations between anatomy and behavior, while inducing visual asymmetry via monocular deprivation rescues object orientation in DCN-symmetric individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Auxin export from proximal fruits drives arrest in competent inflorescence meristems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06</h4>
          <p>A well-defined set of regulatory pathways control entry into the reproductive phase in flowering plants. Conversely, little is known about the mechanisms that control the end of the reproductive phase (floral arrest), despite this being a critical process for optimising fruit and seed production. Complete fruit removal or lack of fertile fruit-set in male sterile mutants, for example male sterile1 (ms1), prevents timely floral arrest in the model plant Arabidopsis. These observations formed the basis for Hensel and colleagues model in which end-of-flowering was proposed to result from a cumulative fruitseed-derived signal that caused simultaneous global proliferative arrest (GPA) in all inflorescences. Recent studies have suggested that end-of-flowering involves gene expression changes at the floral meristem which are at least in part controlled by the FRUITFULL-APETELA2 pathway, however there is limited understanding of how this process is controlled and the communication needed at the whole plant level. Here, we provide new information providing a framework for the fruit-to-meristem (F-M) communication implied by the GPA model. We show that floral arrest in Arabidopsis is not global and does not occur synchronously between branches, but rather that the arrest of each inflorescence is a local process, driven by auxin export from fruit proximal to the inflorescence meristem (IM). Furthermore, we show that inflorescence meristems are only competent for floral arrest once they reach a certain developmental age. Understanding the regulation of floral arrest is of major importance for the future manipulation of flowering to extend and maximise crop yields.</p>

          <p>Effective vaccines inducing lifelong protection against many important infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are not yet available despite decades of research. As an alternative to a protective vaccine we developed a genetic engineering strategy in which CRISPRCas9 was utilized to replace endogenously-encoded antibodies with antibodies protective against RSV, HIV, influenza or EBV in primary human or murine B cells. The engineered antibodies were expressed in up to 59% of primary B cells under the control of endogenous regulatory elements, which maintained normal antibody expression and secretion. Importantly, a single transfer of murine B cells engineered to express an antibody protective against RSV resulted in potent and durable protection against RSV infection in immunocompromised hosts. This approach offers the opportunity to achieve sterilizing immunity against pathogens for which traditional vaccination has failed to induce or maintain protective antibody responses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Characterization of prevalence and health consequences of uniparental disomy in four million individuals from the general population, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06</h4>
          <p>Meiotic nondisjunction and resulting aneuploidy can lead to severe health consequences in humans.  Aneuploidy rescue can restore euploidy but may result in uniparental disomy (UPD), the inheritance of both homologs of a chromosome from one parent with no representative copy from the other. Current understanding of UPD is limited to ~3,300 cases for which UPD was associated with clinical presentation due to imprinting disorders or recessive diseases. Thus, the prevalence of UPD and its phenotypic consequences in the general population are unknown. We searched for instances of UPD in over four million consented research participants from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and 431,094 UK Biobank participants. Using computationally detected DNA segments identical-by-descent (IBD) and runs of homozygosity (ROH), we identified 675 instances of UPD across both databases. Here we present the first characterization of UPD prevalence in the general population, a machine-learning framework to detect UPD using ROH, and a novel association between autism and UPD of chromosome 22.</p>

          <p>Reliable detection of disseminated tumor cells and of the biodistribution of tumor-targeting therapeutic antibodies within the entire body has long been needed to better understand and treat cancer metastasis. Here, we developed an integrated pipeline for automated quantification of cancer metastases and therapeutic antibody targeting, named DeepMACT. First, we enhanced the fluorescent signal of tumor cells more than 100-fold by applying the vDISCO method to image single cancer cells in intact transparent mice. Second, we developed deep learning algorithms for automated quantification of metastases with an accuracy matching human expert manual annotation. Deep learning-based quantifications in a model of spontaneous metastasis using human breast cancer cells allowed us to systematically analyze clinically relevant features such as size, shape, spatial distribution, and the degree to which metastases are targeted by a therapeutic monoclonal antibody in whole mice. DeepMACT can thus considerably improve the discovery of effective therapeutic strategies for metastatic cancer.</p>
