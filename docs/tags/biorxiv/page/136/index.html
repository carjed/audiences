          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">phyloFlash — Rapid SSU rRNA profiling and targeted assembly from metagenomes Supplementary Information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-17</h4>
          <p>The SSU rRNA gene is the key marker in molecular ecology for all domains of life, but is largely absent from metagenome-assembled genomes that often are the only resource available for environmental microbes. Here we present phyloFlash, a pipeline to overcome this gap with rapid, SSU rRNA-centered taxonomic classification, targeted assembly, and graph-based binning of full metagenomic assemblies. We show that a cleanup of artifacts is pivotal even with a curated reference database. With such a filtered database, the general-purpose mapper BBmap extracts SSU rRNA reads five times faster than the rRNA-specialized tool SortMeRNA with similar sensitivity and higher selectivity on simulated metagenomes. Reference-based targeted assemblers yielded either highly fragmented assemblies or high levels of chimerism, so we employ the general-purpose genomic assembler SPAdes. Our optimized implementation is independent of reference database composition and has satisfactory levels of chimera formation. Using the phyloFlash workflow we could recover the first complete genomes of several enigmatic taxa, including Marinamargulisbacteria from surface ocean seawater. phyloFlash quickly processes Illumina (meta)genomic data, is straightforward to use, even as part of high-throughput quality control, and has user-friendly output reports. The software is available at httpsgithub.comHRGVphyloFlash (GPL3 license) and is documented with an online manual.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">BEHST genomic set enrichment analysis enhanced through integration of chromatin long-range interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-01-16</h4>
          <p>Transforming data from genome-scale assays into knowledge of affected molecular functions and pathways is a key challenge in biomedical research. Using vocabularies of functional terms and databases annotating genes with these terms, pathway enrichment methods can identify terms enriched in a gene list. With data that can refer to intergenic regions, however, one must first connect the regions to the terms, which are usually annotated only to genes. To make these connections, existing pathway enrichment approaches apply unwarranted assumptions such as annotating non-coding regions with the terms from adjacent genes. We developed a computational method that instead links genomic regions to annotations using data on long-range chromatin interactions. Our method, Biological Enrichment of Hidden Sequence Targets (BEHST), finds Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched in genomic regions more precisely and accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate BEHST&#39;s ability to retrieve more pertinent and less ambiguous GO terms associated with results of in vivo mouse enhancer screens or enhancer RNA assays for multiple tissue types. BEHST will accelerate the discovery of affected pathways mediated through long-range interactions that explain non-coding hits in genome-wide association study (GWAS) or genome editing screens. BEHST is free software with a command-line interface for Linux or macOS and a web interface (httpbehst.hoffmanlab.org).</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Killer whale genomes reveal a complex history of recurrent admixture and vicariance Supplementary Materials, bioRxiv, 2019-01-16</h4>
          <p>Reconstruction of the demographic and evolutionary history of populations assuming a consensus tree-like relationship can mask more complex scenarios, which are prevalent in nature. An emerging genomic toolset, which has been most comprehensively harnessed in the reconstruction of human evolutionary history, enables molecular ecologists to elucidate complex population histories. Killer whales have limited extrinsic barriers to dispersal and have radiated globally, and are therefore a good candidate model for the application of such tools. Here, we analyse a global dataset of killer whale genomes in a rare attempt to elucidate global population structure in a non-human species. We identify a pattern of genetic homogenisation at lower latitudes and the greatest differentiation at high latitudes, even between currently sympatric lineages. The processes underlying the major axis of structure include high drift at the edge of species&#39; range, likely associated with founder effects and allelic surfing during post-glacial range expansion. Divergence between Antarctic and non-Antarctic lineages is further driven by ancestry segments with up to four-fold older coalescence time than the genome-wide average; relicts of a previous vicariance during an earlier glacial cycle. Our study further underpins that episodic gene flow is ubiquitous in natural populations, and can occur across great distances and after substantial periods of isolation between populations. Thus, understanding the evolutionary history of a species requires comprehensive geographic sampling and genome-wide data to sample the variation in ancestry within individuals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probabilistic cell type assignment of single-cell transcriptomic data reveals spatiotemporal microenvironment dynamics in human cancers Supplementary tables, bioRxiv, 2019-01-16</h4>
          <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed biomedical research, enabling decomposition of complex tissues into disaggregated, functionally distinct cell types. For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via mapping procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects. We demonstrate the analytical advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and exemplify real-world utility to profile the spatial dynamics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the temporal dynamics of follicular lymphoma. Our analysis reveals subclonal malignant phenotypes and points towards an evolutionary interplay between immune and cancer cell populations with cancer cells escaping immune recognition.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fast and accurate reference-guided scaffolding of draft genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14</h4>
          <p>Background As the number of new genome assemblies continues to grow, there is increasing demand for methods to coalesce contigs from draft assemblies into pseudomolecules. Most current methods use genetic maps, optical maps, chromatin conformation (Hi-C), or other long-range linking data, however these data are expensive and analysis methods often fail to accurately order and orient a high percentage of assembly contigs. Other approaches utilize alignments to a reference genome for ordering and orienting, however these tools rely on slow aligners and are not robust to repetitive contigs.Results We present RaGOO, an open-source reference-guided contig ordering and orienting tool that leverages the speed and sensitivity of Minimap2 to accurately achieve chromosome-scale assemblies in just minutes. With the pseudomolecules constructed, RaGOO identifies structural variants, including those spanning sequencing gaps that are not reported by alternative methods. We show that RaGOO accurately orders and orients contigs into nearly complete chromosomes based on de novo assemblies of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing from three wild and domesticated tomato genotypes, including the widely used M82 reference cultivar. We then demonstrate the scalability and utility of RaGOO with a pan-genome analysis of 103 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions by examining the structural variants detected in the newly assembled pseudomolecules. RaGOO is available open-source with an MIT license at httpsgithub.commalongeRaGOO.Conclusions We demonstrate that with a highly contiguous assembly and a structurally accurate reference genome, reference-guided scaffolding with RaGOO outperforms error-prone reference-free methods and enable rapid pan-genome analysis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single cell multi-omics profiling reveals a hierarchical epigenetic landscape during mammalian germ layer specification Supplementary Figures, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14</h4>
          <p>Formation of the three primary germ layers during gastrulation is an essential step in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan. Recent studies employing single cell RNA-sequencing have identified major transcriptional changes associated with germ layer specification. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different epigenetic layers is unclear. Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.</p>
