          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Hunter-gatherer genomes reveal diverse demographic trajectories following the rise of farming in East Africa, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>A major outstanding question in human prehistory is the fate of hunting and gathering populations following the rise of agriculture and pastoralism. Genomic analysis of ancient and contemporary Europeans suggests that autochthonous groups were either absorbed into or replaced by expanding farmer populations. Many of the hunter-gatherer populations persisting today live in Africa, perhaps because agropastoral transitions occurred later on the continent. Here, we present the first genomic data from the Chabu, a relatively isolated and marginalized hunting-and-gathering group from the Southwestern Ethiopian highlands. The Chabu are a distinct genetic population that carry the highest levels of Southwestern Ethiopian ancestry of any extant population studied thus far. This ancestry has been in situ for at least 4,500 years. We show that the Chabu are undergoing a severe population bottleneck which began around 40 generations ago. We also study other Eastern African populations and demonstrate divergent patterns of historical population size change over the past 60 generations between even closely related groups. We argue that these patterns demonstrate that, unlike in Europe, Africans hunter-gatherers responded to agropastoralism with diverse strategies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Insulin enhances presynaptic glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens via opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>Insulin influences learning and cognition and activity in brain centers that mediate reward and motivation in humans. However, very little is known about how insulin influences excitatory transmission within brain reward centers such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Further, insulin dysregulation that accompanies obesity is linked to cognitive decline, depression, anxiety, and aberrant motivation that also rely on excitatory transmission in the NAc, but potential mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that insulin receptor activation increases presynaptic glutamate release via a previously unidentified form of opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, whereas activation of IGF receptors by insulin decreases presynaptic glutamate release in the NAc. Furthermore, obesity results in a loss of the insulin receptor-mediated increases and a reduction in NAc insulin receptor surface expression, while preserving reductions in excitatory transmission mediated by IGF receptors. These results provide the first insights into how insulin influences excitatory transmission in the adult brain and have broad implications for the regulation of motivation and reward related processes by peripheral hormones.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The genome of C57BL6J Eve, the mother of the laboratory mouse genome reference strain, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>Isogenic laboratory mouse strains are used to enhance reproducibility as individuals within a strain are essentially genetically identical. For the most widely used isogenic strain, C57BL6, there is also a wealth of genetic, phenotypic, and genomic data, including one of the highest quality reference genomes (GRCm38.p6). However, laboratory mouse strains are living reagents and hence genetic drift occurs and is an unavoidable source of accumulating genetic variability that can have an impact on reproducibility over time. Nearly 20 years after the first release of the mouse reference genome, individuals from the strain it represents (C57BL6J) are at least 26 inbreeding generations removed from the individuals used to generate the mouse reference genome. Moreover, C57BL6J is now maintained through the periodic reintroduction of mice from cryopreserved embryo stocks that are derived from a single breeder pair, aptly named C57BL6J Adam and Eve. To more accurately represent the genome of today&#39;s C57BL6J mice, we have generated a de novo assembly of the C57BL6J Eve genome (B6Eve) using high coverage, long-read sequencing, optical mapping, and short-read data. Using these data, we addressed recurring variants observed in previous mouse studies. We have also identified structural variations that impact coding sequences, closed gaps in the mouse reference assembly, some of which are in genes, and we have identified previously unannotated coding sequences through long read sequencing of cDNAs. This B6Eve assembly explains discrepant observations that have been associated with GRCm38-based analyses, and has provided data towards a reference genome that is more representative of the C57BL6J mice that are in use today.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tumor mutational landscape is a record of the pre-malignant state, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12</h4>
          <p>Chromatin structure has a major influence on the cell-specific density of somatic mutations along the cancer genome. Here, we present a pan-cancer study in which we searched for the putative cancer cell-of-origin of 2,550 whole genomes, representing 32 cancer types by matching their mutational landscape to the regional patterns of chromatin modifications ascertained in 104 normal tissue types. We found that, in almost all cancer types, the cell-of-origin can be predicted solely from their DNA sequences. Our analysis validated the hypothesis that high-grade serous ovarian cancer originates in the fallopian tube and identified distinct origins of breast cancer subtypes. We also demonstrated that the technique is equally capable of identifying the cell-of-origin for a series of 2,044 metastatic samples from 22 of the tumor types available as primaries. Moreover, cancer drivers, whether inherited or acquired, reside in active chromatin regions in the respective cell-of-origin. Taken together, our findings highlight that many somatic mutations accumulate while the chromatin structure of the cell-of-origin is maintained and that this historical record, captured in the DNA, can be used to identify the often elusive cancer cell-of-origin.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Chloroplasts navigate towards the pathogen interface to counteract infection by the Irish potato famine pathogen, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10</h4>
          <p>Chloroplasts are light harvesting organelles that arose from ancient endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. Upon immune activation, chloroplasts switch off photosynthesis, produce anti-microbial compounds, and develop tubular extensions called stromules. We report that chloroplasts navigate to the pathogen interface to counteract infection by the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, physically associating with the specialised membrane that engulfs pathogen haustoria. Outer envelope protein, chloroplast unusual positioning1 (CHUP1), anchors chloroplasts to the host-pathogen interface. Stromules are induced during infection in a CHUP1-dependent manner, embracing haustoria and interconnecting chloroplasts, to form dynamic organelle clusters. Infection-triggered reprogramming of chloroplasts relies on surface immune signalling, whereas pathogen effectors subvert these immune pulses. Chloroplast are deployed focally, and coordinate to restrict pathogen entry into plant cells, a process actively countered by parasite effectors.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolutionary Dynamics Do Not Motivate a Single-Mutant Theory of Human Language Supplementary Sections, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10</h4>
          <p>One of the most controversial hypotheses in cognitive science is the Chomskyan evolutionary conjecture that language arose instantaneously in our species as the result of a single staggeringly fortuitous mutation. Here we analyze the evolutionary dynamics implied by this hypothesis, which has never been formalized. The theory supposes the emergence and fixation of a single mutant (capable of the syntactic operation Merge) during a narrow historical window as a result of frequency-independent selection under a huge fitness advantage in a population of an effective size that is standardly assumed to have been no larger than ~15 000 early humans. We examine this proposal by combining diffusion analysis and extreme value theory to derive a probabilistic formulation of its dynamics. Perhaps counter-intuitively, a macro-mutation is much more unlikely a priori than multiple mutations with smaller fitness effects, yet both hypotheses predict fixation with high conditional probability. The consequences of this asymmetry have not been accounted for previously. Our results diffuse any suggestion that evolutionary reasoning provides an independent rationale for the controversial single-mutant theory of language.</p>
