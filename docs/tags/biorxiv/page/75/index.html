          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Screening human embryos for polygenic traits has limited utility, bioRxiv, 2019-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenome-wide association studies have led to the development of polygenic score (PS) predictors that explain increasing proportions of the variance in human complex traits. In parallel, progress in preimplantation genetic testing now allows genome-wide genotyping of embryos generated via in vitro fertilization (IVF). Jointly, these developments suggest the possibility of screening embryos for polygenic traits such as height or cognitive function. There are clear ethical, legal, and societal concerns regarding such a procedure, but these cannot be properly discussed in the absence of data on the expected outcomes of screening. Here, we use theory, simulations, and real data to evaluate the potential gain of PS-based embryo selection, defined as the expected difference in trait value between the top-scoring embryo and an average, unselected embryo. We observe that the gain increases very slowly with the number of embryos, but more rapidly with increased variance explained by the PS. Given currently available polygenic predictors and typical IVF yields, the average gain due to selection would be ≈2.5cm if selecting for height, and ≈2.5 IQ (intelligence quotient) points if selecting for cognitive function. These mean values are accompanied by wide confidence intervals; in real data drawn from nuclear families with up to 20 offspring each, we observe that the offspring with the highest PS for height was the tallest only in 25% of the families. We discuss prospects and limitations of PS-based embryo selection for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Using Deep Learning to Annotate the Protein Universe, bioRxiv, 2019-05-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function is a long-standing problem in molecular biology with far-reaching scientific implications. Despite six decades of progress, state-of-the-art techniques cannot annotate 13 of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit sequences collected from diverse organisms. In this paper, we explore an alternative methodology based on deep learning that learns the relationship between unaligned amino acid sequences and their functional annotations across all 17929 families of the Pfam database. Using the Pfam seed sequences we establish rigorous benchmark assessments that use both random and clustered data splits to control for potentially confounding sequence similarities between train and test sequences. Using Pfam full, we report convolutional networks that are significantly more accurate and computationally efficient than BLASTp, while learning sequence features such as structural disorder and transmembrane helices. Our model co-locates sequences from unseen families in embedding space, allowing sequences from novel families to be accurately annotated. These results suggest deep learning models will be a core component of future protein function prediction tools.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Defined cell types in superior colliculus make distinct contributions to prey capture behavior in the mouse, bioRxiv, 2019-05-04</h4>
          <p>SummaryThe superior colliculus (SC) mediates rapid orienting to visual stimuli across species. To determine the specific circuits within the SC that drive orienting and approach behavior toward appetitive stimuli, we explored the role of three genetically defined cell types in mediating prey capture in mice. Chemogenetic inactivation of two classically defined cell types, the wide-field (WF) and narrow-field (NF) vertical neurons, revealed that they are involved in distinct aspects of prey capture. WF neurons were required for rapid prey detection and distant approach initiation, whereas NF neurons were required for continuous and accurate orienting during pursuit. In contrast, prey capture did not require parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons that have previously been implicated in fear responses. The visual coding of WF and NF cells in the awake mouse and their projection targets were consistent with their roles in prey detection versus pursuit. Thus, our studies link specific neural circuit connectivity and function with stimulus detection and orienting behavior, providing insight into visuomotor and attentional mechanisms mediated by superior colliculus.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;This study provides the first demonstration of the role of specific cell populations in the superior colliculus in orienting and approach behavior.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;A genetically targeted population of wide-field vertical neurons in the superior colliculus is required for rapid prey detection and initiation of long-distance approaches.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;A genetically targeted population of narrow-field vertical neurons is required for approach initiation, accurate targeting, and approach continuity.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Visual response properties and projection targets of these cells are consistent with their role in prey capture, linking neural circuit connectivity and function with behavior.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Increasing Importance of Fellowships and Career Development Awards in the Careers of Early-Stage Biomedical Academic Researchers, bioRxiv, 2019-05-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractExcessive competition for biomedical faculty positions has ratcheted up the need to accumulate some mix of high-quality publications and prestigious grants to move from a training position to university faculty. How universities value each of these attributes when considering faculty candidates is critical for understanding what is needed to succeed as academic faculty. In this study, I analyzed publicly available NIH grant information to determine the grants first-time R01 (FTR01) awardees held during their training period. Increases in the percentage of the FTR01 population that held a training award demonstrate these awards are becoming a more common component of a faculty candidate’s resume. The increase was largely due to an expansion of NIH K-series career development awards between 2000 and 2017. FTR01 awardees with a K01, K08, K23, or K99 award were overrepresented in a subset of institutions, whereas FTR01 awardees with F32 fellowships and those with no training award were evenly distributed across institutions. Finally, training awardees from top institutions were overrepresented in the faculty of the majority of institutions, echoing data from other fields where a select few institutions supply an overwhelming majority of the faculty for the rest of the field. These data give important insight into how trainees compete for NIH funding and faculty positions and how institutions prefer those with or without training awards.</p>

          <p>SummaryHow neural circuits develop in the human brain has remained almost impossible to study at the neuronal level. Here we investigate human cortical neuron development, plasticity and function, using a mousehuman chimera model in which xenotransplanted human cortical pyramidal neurons integrate as single cells into the mouse cortex. Combined neuronal tracing, electrophysiology, and in vivo structural and functional imaging revealed that the human neurons develop morphologically and functionally following a prolonged developmental timeline, revealing the cell-intrinsic retention of juvenile properties of cortical neurons as an important mechanism underlying human brain neoteny. Following maturation, human neurons transplanted in the visual cortex display tuned responses to visual stimuli that are similar to those of mouse neurons, indicating capacity for physiological synaptic integration of human neurons in mouse cortical circuits. These findings provide new insights into human neuronal development, and open novel experimental avenues for the study of human neuronal function and diseases.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Coordinated morphological and functional maturation of ESC-derived human cortical neurons transplanted in the mouse cortex.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Transplanted neurons display prolonged juvenile features indicative of intrinsic species-specific neoteny.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Transplanted neurons develop elaborate dendritic arbors, stable spine patterns and long-term synaptic plasticity.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;In the visual cortex transplanted neurons display tuned visual responses that resemble those of the host cortical neurons.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A Spatiomolecular Map of the Striatum, bioRxiv, 2019-05-02</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYThe striatum is organized into two major outputs formed by striatal projection neuron (SPN) subtypes with distinct molecular identities. In addition, the histochemical division into patch and matrix compartments represents an additional spatial organization, proposed to mirror a functional specialization in a motor-motivation dimension. To map the molecular diversity of SPNs in the context of the patch and matrix division, we genetically labeled mu-opioid receptor (Oprm1) expressing striatal neurons and performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). This allowed us to establish new molecular definitions of the patch-matrix compartments, resulting in a molecular code for mapping patch SPNs at the cellular level. In addition, Oprm1 expression labeled exopatch SPNs, which we found to be molecularly distinct from both patch as well as neighboring matrix SPNs, thereby forming a separate molecular entity. At the cell-type level, we found an unexpected SPN diversity, leading to the identification of a new Col11a1&#43; striatonigral SPN type. At the tissue level, we found that mapping the spatial expression of a number of markers revealed new definitions of spatial domains in the striatum, which were conserved in the non-human primate brain. Interestingly, the spatial markers were cell-type independent and instead represented a spatial code that was found across all SPNs within a spatially restricted domain. This spatiomolecular map establishes a formal system for targeting and studying the striatal subregions and SPNs subtypes, beyond the classical striatonigral and striatopallidal division.</p>
