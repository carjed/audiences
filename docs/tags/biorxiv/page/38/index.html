          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An approximate full-likelihood method for inferring selection and allele frequency trajectories from DNA sequence data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractMost current methods for detecting natural selection from DNA sequence data are limited in that they are either based on summary statistics or a composite likelihood, and as a consequence, do not make full use of the information available in DNA sequence data. We here present a new importance sampling approach for approximating the full likelihood function for the selection coefficient. The method treats the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) as a latent variable that is integrated out using previously published Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The method can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, testing models of changes in the strength of selection, estimating the time of the start of a selective sweep, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the method and show that it uniformly improves power to detect selection compared to current popular methods such as nSL and SDS, under various demographic models and can provide reliable inferences of allele frequency trajectories under many conditions. We also explore the potential of our method to detect extremely recent changes in the strength of selection. We use the method to infer the past allele frequency trajectory for a lactase persistence SNP (MCM6) in Europeans. We also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants. Several genes show evidence of strong selection particularly within the last 5,000 years, including ASIP, KITLG, and TYR. However, selection on OCA2HERC2 seems to be much older and, in contrast to previous claims, we find no evidence of selection on TYRP1.Author summaryCurrent methods to study natural selection using modern population genomic data are limited in their power and flexibility. Here, we present a new method to infer natural selection that builds on recent methodological advances in estimating genome-wide genealogies. By using importance sampling we are able to efficiently estimate the likelihood function of the selection coefficient. We show our method improves power to test for selection over competing methods across a diverse range of scenarios, and also accurately infers the selection coefficient. We also demonstrate a novel capability of our model, using it to infer the allele’s frequency over time. We validate these results with a study of a lactase persistence SNP in Europeans, and also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Polygenic architecture of human neuroanatomical diversity, bioRxiv, 2019-03-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe analysed the genomic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity using magnetic resonance imaging and SNP data from &amp;gt; 20,000 individuals. Our results replicate previous findings of a strong polygenic architecture of neuroanatomical diversity. SNPs captured from 40% to 54% of the variance in the volume of different brain regions. We observed a large correlation between chromosome length and the amount of phenotypic variance captured, r∼0.64 on average, suggesting that at a global scale causal variants are homogeneously distributed across the genome. At a more local scale, SNPs within genes (∼51%) captured ∼1.5-times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured significantly less variance than those with higher MAF the 40% of SNPs with MAF&amp;lt;5% captured less than one fourth of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of rG∼0.45. Across regions, genetic correlations were in general similar to phenotypic correlations. By contrast, genetic correlations were larger than phenotypic correlations for the leftright volumes of the same region, and indistinguishable from 1. Additionally, the differences in leftright volumes were not heritable, underlining the role of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Research grade marijuana supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse is genetically divergent from commercially available Cannabis, bioRxiv, 2019-03-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractPublic comfort with Cannabis (marijuana and hemp) has recently increased, resulting in previously strict Cannabis regulations now allowing hemp cultivation, medical use, and in some states, recreational consumption. There is a growing interest in the potential medical benefits of the various chemical constituents produced by the Cannabis plant. Currently, the University of Mississippi, funded through the National Institutes of HealthNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIHNIDA), is the sole Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) licensed facility to cultivate Cannabis for research purposes. Hence, most federally funded research where participants consume Cannabis for medicinal purposes relies on NIDA-supplied product. Previous research found that cannabinoid levels in research grade marijuana supplied by NIDA did not align with commercially available Cannabis from Colorado, Washington and California. Given NIDA chemotypes were misaligned with commercial Cannabis, we sought to investigate where NIDA’s research grade marijuana falls on the genetic spectrum of Cannabis groups. NIDA research grade marijuana was found to genetically group with Hemp samples along with a small subset of commercial drug-type Cannabis. A majority of commercially available drug-type Cannabis was genetically very distinct from NIDA samples. These results suggest that subjects consuming NIDA research grade marijuana may experience different effects than average consumers.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in aged rats counteracts the decline in muscle mass and reverses multiple parameters of muscle signaling associated with sarcopenia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is a lack of pharmacological interventions available for sarcopenia, a progressive age-associated loss of muscle mass, leading to a decline in mobility and quality of life. We found mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), a well-established critical positive modulator of mass, to be hyperactivated in sarcopenic muscle. Furthermore, inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway counteracted sarcopenia as determined by observing an increase in muscle mass and fiber type cross sectional area, surprising because mTORC1 signaling has been shown to be required for muscle mass gains in some settings. Additionally, several genes related to senescence were downregulated, while gene expression indicators of neuromuscular junction denervation were diminished using a low dose of a rapalog. Therefore mTORC1 inhibition may delay the progression of sarcopenia by directly and indirectly modulating multiple age-associated pathways, implicating mTORC1 as a therapeutic target to treat sarcopenia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor, bioRxiv, 2019-03-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent developments in experimental technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the profiling a high-dimensional number of genome-wide features in individual cells, inspiring the formation of large-scale data generation projects quantifying unprecedented levels of biological variation at the single-cell level. The data generated in such projects exhibits unique characteristics, including increased sparsity and scale, in terms of both the number of features and the number of samples. Due to these unique characteristics, specialized statistical methods are required along with fast and efficient software implementations in order to successfully derive biological insights. Bioconductor - an open-source, open-development software project based on the R programming language - has pioneered the analysis of such high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, leveraging a rich history of software and methods development that has spanned the era of sequencing. Featuring state-of-the-art computational methods, standardized data infrastructure, and interactive data visualization tools that are all easily accessible as software packages, Bioconductor has made it possible for a diverse audience to analyze data derived from cutting-edge single-cell assays. Here, we present an overview of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis for prospective users and contributors, highlighting the contributions towards this effort made by Bioconductor.</p>
