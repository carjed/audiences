          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inferring single-trial neural population dynamics using sequential auto-encoders, bioRxiv, 2017-06-21</h4>
          <p>Neuroscience is experiencing a data revolution in which simultaneous recording of many hundreds or thousands of neurons is revealing structure in population activity that is not apparent from single-neuron responses. This structure is typically extracted from trial-averaged data. Single-trial analyses are challenging due to incomplete sampling of the neural population, trial-to-trial variability, and fluctuations in action potential timing. Here we introduce Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems (LFADS), a deep learning method to infer latent dynamics from single-trial neural spiking data. LFADS uses a nonlinear dynamical system (a recurrent neural network) to infer the dynamics underlying observed population activity and to extract ‘de-noised’ single-trial firing rates from neural spiking data. We apply LFADS to a variety of monkey and human motor cortical datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict observed behavioral variables with unprecedented accuracy, extract precise estimates of neural dynamics on single trials, infer perturbations to those dynamics that correlate with behavioral choices, and combine data from non-overlapping recording sessions (spanning months) to improve inference of underlying dynamics. In summary, LFADS leverages all observations of a neural population’s activity to accurately model its dynamics on single trials, opening the door to a detailed understanding of the role of dynamics in performing computation and ultimately driving behavior.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Biological classification with RNA-Seq data Can alternative splicing enhance machine learning classifier?, bioRxiv, 2017-06-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe extent to which the genes are expressed in the cell can be simplistically defined as a function of one or more factors of the environment, lifestyle, and genetics. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is becoming a prevalent approach to quantify gene expression, and is expected to gain better insights to a number of biological and biomedical questions, compared to the DNA microarrays. Most importantly, RNA-Seq allows to quantify expression at the gene and alternative splicing isoform levels. However, leveraging the RNA-Seq data requires development of new data mining and analytics methods. Supervised machine learning methods are commonly used approaches for biological data analysis, and have recently gained attention for their applications to the RNA-Seq data.In this work, we assess the utility of supervised learning methods trained on RNA-Seq data for a diverse range of biological classification tasks. We hypothesize that the isoform-level expression data is more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment is done through utilizing multiple datasets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-Seq datasets and include over 2,000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes and, the pathological tumor stage for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each classification problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored. We find that for every single classification problem, the isoform-based classifiers outperform or are comparable with gene expression based methods. The top-performing supervised learning techniques reached a near perfect classification accuracy, demonstrating the utility of supervised learning for RNA-Seq based data analysis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Punctuated evolution shaped modern vertebrate diversity, bioRxiv, 2017-06-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe relative importance of different modes of evolution in shaping phenotypic diversity remains a hotly debated question. Fossil data suggest that stasis may be a common mode of evolution, while modern data suggest very fast rates of evolution. One way to reconcile these observations is to imagine that evolution is punctuated, rather than gradual, on geological time scales. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel maximum likelihood framework for fitting Lévy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both a gradual and punctuated component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fit by punctuated processes over models of gradual change, gradual stasis, and adaptive radiation. When we compare our results to theoretical expectations of the rate and speed of regime shifts for models that detail fitness landscape dynamics, we find that our quantitative results are broadly compatible with both microevolutionary models and with observations from the fossil record.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Environmental factors dominate over host genetics in shaping human gut microbiota composition, bioRxiv, 2017-06-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHuman gut microbiome composition is shaped by multiple host intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but the relative contribution of host genetic compared to environmental factors remains elusive. Here, we genotyped a cohort of 696 healthy individuals from several distinct ancestral origins and a relatively common environment, and demonstrate that there is no statistically significant association between microbiome composition and ethnicity, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), or overall genetic similarity, and that only 5 of 211 (2.4%) previously reported microbiome-SNP associations replicate in our cohort. In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics. Consistent with our finding that microbiome and host genetics are largely independent, we find significant biome-explainability levels of 16-33% for body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), and lactose consumption. We further show that several human phenotypes can be predicted substantially more accurately when adding microbiome data to host genetics data, and that the contribution of both data sources to prediction accuracy is largely additive. Overall, our results suggest that human microbiome composition is dominated by environmental factors rather than by host genetics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Platform for rapid nanobody discovery in vitro, bioRxiv, 2017-06-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractCamelid single-domain antibody fragments (“nanobodies”) provide the remarkable specificity of antibodies within a single immunoglobulin VHH domain. This unique feature enables applications ranging from their use as biochemical tools to therapeutic agents. Virtually all nanobodies reported to date have been obtained by animal immunization, a bottleneck restricting many applications of this technology. To solve this problem, we developed a fully in vitro platform for nanobody discovery based on yeast surface display of a synthetic nanobody scaffold. This platform provides a facile and cost-effective method for rapidly isolating nanobodies targeting a diverse range of antigens. We provide a blueprint for identifying nanobodies starting from both purified and non-purified antigens, and in addition, we demonstrate application of the platform to discover rare conformationally-selective nanobodies to a lipid flippase and a G protein-coupled receptor. To facilitate broad deployment of this platform, we have made the library and all associated protocols publicly available.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Identification of a novel interspecific hybrid yeast from a metagenomic spontaneously inoculated beer sample using Hi-C, bioRxiv, 2017-06-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractInterspecific hybridization is a common mechanism enabling genetic diversification and adaptation; however, the detection of hybrid species has been quite difficult. The identification of microbial hybrids is made even more complicated, as most environmental microbes are resistant to culturing and must be studied in their native mixed communities. We have previously adapted the chromosome conformation capture method Hi-C to the assembly of genomes from mixed populations. Here, we show the method’s application in assembling genomes directly from an uncultured, mixed population from a spontaneously inoculated beer sample. Our assembly method has enabled us to de-convolute 4 bacterial and 4 yeast genomes from this sample, including a putative yeast hybrid. Downstream isolation and analysis of this hybrid confirmed its genome to consist of Pichia membranifaciens and that of another related, but undescribed yeast. Our work shows that Hi-C-based metagenomic methods can overcome the limitation of traditional sequencing methods in studying complex mixtures of genomes.</p>
