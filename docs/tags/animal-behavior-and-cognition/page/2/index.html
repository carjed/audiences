          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Perception of naturally dead conspecifics impairs health and longevity through serotonin signaling in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2019-01-09</h4>
          <p>Sensory perception modulates health and aging across taxa. Understanding the nature of relevant cues and the mechanisms underlying their action may lead to novel interventions that improve the length and quality of life. In humans, psychological trauma is often associated with the recognition of dead individuals, with chronic exposure leading to persistent mental health issues including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The mechanisms that link mental and physical health, and the degree to which these are shared across species, remain largely unknown. Here we show that the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has the capability to perceive dead conspecifics in its environment and that this perceptive experience induces both short- and long-term effects on health and longevity. Death perception is mediated by visual and olfactory cues, and remarkably, its effects on aging are eliminated by targeted attenuation of serotonin signaling. Our results suggest a complex perceptive ability in Drosophila that reveals deeply conserved mechanistic links between psychological state and aging, the roots of which might be unearthed using invertebrate model systems.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Highly Heritable and Functionally Relevant Breed Differences in Dog Behavior, bioRxiv, 2019-01-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractVariation across dog breeds presents a unique opportunity for investigating the evolution and biological basis of complex behavioral traits. We integrated behavioral data from more than 17,000 dogs from 101 breeds with breed-averaged genotypic data (N = 5,697 dogs) from over 100,000 loci in the dog genome. Across 14 traits, we found that breed differences in behavior are highly heritable, and that clustering of breeds based on behavior accurately recapitulates genetic relationships. We identify 131 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breed differences in behavior, which are found in genes that are highly expressed in the brain and enriched for neurobiological functions and developmental processes. Our results provide insight into the heritability and genetic architecture of complex behavioral traits, and suggest that dogs provide a powerful model for these questions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Posture controls mechanical tuning in the black widow spider mechanosensory system, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05</h4>
          <p>Spiders rely on mechanical vibration sensing for sexual signalling, prey capture and predator evasion. The sensory organs underlying vibration detection, called slit sensilla, resemble cracks in the spider&#39;s exoskeleton, and are distributed all over the spider body. Those crucial to sensing web- and other substrate-borne vibrations are called lyriform organs and are densely distributed around leg joints. It has been shown that forces that cause bending at leg joints also activate these lyriform organs. Little is known of how the biomechanics of the body of a freely-suspended spider in its natural posture interact with vibrations introduced into the body and how this affects vibration perception. Female black widow spiders, in particular, have a striking body-form; their long thin legs support a large pendulous abdomen. Here, we show that in their natural posture, the large abdominal mass of black widow females, interacts with the spring-like behaviour of their leg joints and determines the mechanical behaviour of different leg joints. Furthermore, we find that adopting different body postures enables females to alter both the level and tuning of the mechanical input to lyriform organs. Therefore, we suggest that posture may be used to flexibly and reversibly focus attention to different classes or components of web vibration. Postural effects thus emphasize the dynamic loop of interactions between behaviour and perception, i.e. between &#39;brain&#39; and body.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">On the adaptive behavior of head-fixed flies navigating in two-dimensional, visual virtual reality, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractA navigating animal’s sensory experience is shaped not just by its surroundings, but by its movements within them, which in turn are influenced by its past experiences. Studying the intertwined roles of sensation, experience and directed action in navigation has been made easier by the development of virtual reality (VR) environments for head-fixed animals, which allow for quantitative measurements of behavior in well-controlled sensory conditions. VR has long featured in studies of Drosophila melanogaster, but these experiments have typically relied on one-dimensional (1D) VR, effectively allowing the fly to change only its heading in a visual scene, and not its position. Here we explore how flies navigate in a two-dimensional (2D) visual VR environment that more closely resembles their experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ interaction with landmarks in 2D environments cannot be automatically derived from their behavior in simpler 1D environments. Using a novel paradigm, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D VR adapt their behavior in a visual environment in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search behavior. Finally, by pairing optogenetic activation of heat-sensing cells to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of landmarks associated with aversive “virtual heat”. These head-fixed paradigms set the stage for an interrogation of fly brain circuitry underlying flexible navigation in complex visual environments.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Proximity sensors reveal social information transfer in maternity colonies of Common noctule bats, bioRxiv, 2018-09-20</h4>
          <p>Summary&lt;jatslist list-type=order&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Bats are a highly gregarious taxon suggesting that social information should be readily available for making decision. Social information transfer in maternity colonies might be a particularly efficient mechanism for naïve pups to acquire information on resources from informed adults. However, such behaviour is difficult to study in the wild, in particular in elusive and small-bodied animals such as bats.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;The goal of this study was to investigate the role of social information in acquiring access to two types of resources, which are crucial in the life of a juvenile bat suitable roosting sites and fruitful feeding grounds. We hypothesized that fledging offspring will make use of social information by following informed members of the social groups to unknown roosts or foraging sites.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;In the present study we applied for the first time the newly developed miniaturized proximity sensor system ‘BATS’, a fully automated system for documenting associations among individual bats both while roosting and while on the wing. We quantified associations among juveniles and other group member while switching roosts and during foraging.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;We found clear evidence for information transfer while switching roosts, mainly among juveniles and their genetically identified mothers. Anecdotal observations suggest intentional guidance behaviour by mothers, indicated by repeated commuting flights among the pup and the target roost. Infrequent, short meetings with colony members other than the mother indicate local enhancement at foraging sites, but no intentional information transfer.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Our study illustrates how advances in technology enable researchers to solve long-standing puzzles. Miniaturized proximity sensors facilitate the automated collection of continuous data sets and represent an ideal tool to gain novel insights into the sociobiology of elusive and small-bodied species.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A systematic review of Drosophila short-term-memory genetics meta-analysis reveals robust reproducibility, bioRxiv, 2018-01-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractGeneticists use olfactory conditioning in Drosophila to identify learning genes; however, little is known about how these genes are integrated into short-term memory (STM) pathways. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the STM evidence base is weak. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the field. Using metrics to quantify variation between discovery articles and follow-up studies, we found that seven genes were both highly replicated, and highly reproducible. However, ~80% of STM genes have never been replicated. While only a few studies investigated interactions, the reviewed genes could account for &amp;gt;1000% memory. This large summed effect size could indicate irreproducibility, many shared pathways, or that current assay protocols lack the specificity needed to identify core plasticity genes. Mechanistic theories of memory will require the convergence of evidence from system, circuit, cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments; systematic data synthesis is an essential tool for integrated neuroscience.</p>
