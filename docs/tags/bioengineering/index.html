          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Octopi Open configurable high-throughput imaging platform for infectious disease diagnosis in the field, bioRxiv, 2019-06-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractAccess to quantitative, robust, yet affordable diagnostic tools is necessary to reduce global infectious disease burden. Manual microscopy has served as a bedrock for diagnostics with wide adaptability, although at a cost of tedious labor and human errors. Automated robotic microscopes are poised to enable a new era of smart field microscopy but current platforms remain cost prohibitive and largely inflexible, especially for resource poor and field settings. Here we present Octopi, a low-cost ($250-$500) and reconfigurable autonomous microscopy platform capable of automated slide scanning and correlated bright-field and fluorescence imaging. Being highly modular, it also provides a framework for new disease-specific modules to be developed. We demonstrate the power of the platform by applying it to automated detection of malaria parasites in blood smears. Specifically, we discovered a spectral shift on the order of 10 nm for DAPI-stained Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. This shift allowed us to detect the parasites with a low magnification (equivalent to 10x) large field of view (2.56 mm2) module. Combined with automated slide scanning, real time computer vision and machine learning-based classification, Octopi is able to screen more than 1.5 million red blood cells per minute for parasitemia quantification, with estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90% at parasitemia of 50ul and 100% for parasitemia higher than 150l. With different modules, we further showed imaging of tissue slice and sputum sample on the platform. With roughly two orders of magnitude in cost reduction, Octopi opens up the possibility of a large robotic microscope network for improved disease diagnosis while providing an avenue for collective efforts for development of modular instruments.One sentence summaryWe developed a low-cost ($250-$500) automated imaging platform that can quantify malaria parasitemia by scanning 1.5 million red blood cells per minute.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Optogenetic control of Wnt signaling for modeling early embryogenic patterning with human pluripotent stem cells, bioRxiv, 2019-06-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and self-organization during early embryonic development are governed by dynamic, spatially and temporally varying morphogen signals. Analogous tissue patterns emerge spontaneously in embryonic stem cell (ESC) models for gastrulation, but mechanistic insight into this self-organization is limited by a lack of molecular methods to precisely control morphogen signal dynamics. Here we combine optogenetic stimulation and single-cell imaging approaches to study self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells. Precise control of morphogen signal dynamics, achieved through activation of canonical Wntβ-catenin signaling over a broad high dynamic range (&amp;gt;500-fold) using an optoWnt optogenetic system, drove broad transcriptional changes and mesendoderm differentiation of human ESCs at high efficiency (&amp;gt;95% cells). Furthermore, activating Wnt signaling in subpopulations of ESCs in 2D and 3D cultures induced cell self-organization and morphogenesis reminiscent of human gastrulation, including changes in cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our findings thus reveal an instructive role for Wnt in directing cell patterning in this ESC model for gastrulation.</p>

          <p>AbstractWe present cleared tissue Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscopy (ctASLM), which achieves sub-micron isotropic resolution, high optical sectioning capability, and large field of view imaging (870×870 μm2) over a broad range of immersion media. ctASLM can image live, expanded, and both aqueous and organic chemically cleared tissue preparations and provides 2- to 5-fold better axial resolution than confocal or other reported cleared tissue light-sheet microscopes. We image millimeter-sized tissues with sub-micron 3D resolution, which enabled us to perform automated detection of cells and subcellular features such as dendritic spines.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ultrasound Imaging of Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe study of cellular processes occurring inside intact organisms and the development of cell-based diagnostic and therapeutic agents requires methods to visualize cellular functions such as gene expression in deep tissues. Ultrasound is a widely used biomedical technology enabling deep-tissue imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, no genetically encoded molecular reporters are available to connect ultrasound contrast to gene expression in mammalian cells. To address this limitation, we introduce the first mammalian acoustic reporter genes. Starting with an eleven-gene polycistronic gene cluster derived from bacteria, we engineered a eukaryotic genetic program whose introduction into mammalian cells results in the expression of a unique class of intracellular air-filled protein nanostructures called gas vesicles. The scattering of ultrasound by these nanostructures allows mammalian cells to be visualized at volumetric densities below 0.5%, enables the monitoring of dynamic circuit-driven gene expression, and permits high-resolution imaging of gene expression in living animals. These mammalian acoustic reporter genes enable previously impossible approaches to monitoring the location, viability and function of mammalian cells in vivo.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Machine learning-guided channelrhodopsin engineering enables minimally-invasive optogenetics, bioRxiv, 2019-03-04</h4>
          <p>We have engineered light-gated channelrhodopsins (ChRs) whose current strength and light sensitivity enable minimally-invasive neuronal circuit interrogation. Current ChR tools applied to the mammalian brain require intracranial surgery for transgene delivery and implantation of invasive fiber-optic cables to produce light-dependent activation of a small volume of brain tissue [~1 mm3]. To enable optogenetics for large brain volumes and without the need for invasive implants, our ChR engineering approach leverages the significant literature of ChR variants to train statistical models for the design of new, high-performance ChRs. With Gaussian Process models trained on a limited experimental set of 102 functionally characterized ChR variants, we designed high-photocurrent ChRs with unprecedented light sensitivity; three of these, ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3, enable optogenetic activation of the nervous system via minimally-invasive systemic transgene delivery with rAAV-PHP.eB, which was not possible previously due to low per-cell transgene copy produced by systemic delivery. These engineered ChRs enable light-induced neuronal excitation without invasive intracranial surgery for virus delivery or fiber optic implantation, i.e. they enable minimally-invasive optogenetics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-Fidelity Nanopore Sequencing of Ultra-Short DNA Sequences, bioRxiv, 2019-02-17</h4>
          <p>Nanopore sequencing offers a portable and affordable alternative to sequencing-by-synthesis methods but suffers from lower accuracy and cannot sequence ultra-short DNA. This puts applications such as molecular diagnostics based on the analysis of cell-free DNA or single-nucleotide variants (SNV) out of reach. To overcome these limitations, we report a nanopore-based sequencing strategy in which short target sequences are first circularized and then amplified via rolling-circle amplification to produce long stretches of concatemeric repeats. These can be sequenced on the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), and the resulting repeat sequences aligned to produce a highly-accurate consensus that reduces the high error-rate present in the individual repeats. Using this approach, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to obtain unbiased and accurate nanopore data for target DNA sequences of &amp;lt; 100 bp. Critically, this approach is sensitive enough to achieve SNV discrimination in mixtures of sequences and even enables quantitative detection of specific variants present at ratios of &amp;lt; 10%. Our method is simple, cost-effective, and only requires well-established processes. It therefore expands the utility of nanopore sequencing for molecular diagnostics and other applications, especially in resource-limited settings.</p>
