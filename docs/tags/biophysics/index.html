          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct Imaging of Liquid Domains in Membranes by Cryo Electron Tomography, bioRxiv, 2020-02-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTImages of micron-scale domains in lipid bilayers have provided the gold standard of model-free evidence to understand the domains’ shapes, sizes, and distributions. Corresponding techniques to directly and quantitatively assess smaller (nanoscale and submicron) liquid domains have been lacking, leading to an inability to answer key questions. For example, researchers commonly seek to correlate activities of membrane proteins with attributes of the domains in which they reside; doing so hinges on identification and characterization of membrane domains. Although some features of membrane domains can be probed by indirect methods, these methods are often constrained by the limitation that data must be analyzed in the context of models that require multiple assumptions or parameters. Here, we address this challenge by developing and testing two new methods of identifying submicron domains in biomimetic membranes. Both methods leverage cryo-electron tomograms of ternary membranes under native solution conditions. The first method is optimized for probe-free applications domains are directly distinguished from the surrounding membrane by their thickness. This technique measures area fractions of domains with quantitative accuracy, in excellent agreement with known phase diagrams. The second method is optimized for applications in which a single label is deployed for imaging membranes by both high-resolution cryo-electron tomography and diffraction-limited optical microscopy. For this method, we test a panel of probes, find that a trimeric mCherry label performs best, and specify criteria for developing future high-performance, dual-use probes. These developments have led to the first direct and quantitative imaging of submicron membrane domains under native conditions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFluorescence micrographs that capture the sizes, shapes, and distributions of liquid domains in model membranes have provided high standards of evidence to prove (and disprove) theories of how micron-scale domains form and grow. Corresponding theories about smaller domains have remained untested, partly because experimental methods of identifying submicron domains in vesicles under native solvent conditions have not been available. Here we introduce two such methods. Both leverage cryo-electron tomography to observe membrane features far smaller than the diffraction limit of light. The first method is probe-free and identifies differences in thicknesses between liquid domains and their surrounding membranes. The second method identifies membrane regions labeled by an electron-dense, fluorescent protein, which enables direct comparison of fluorescence micrographs with cryo-electron tomograms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct label-free imaging of nanodomains in biomimetic and biological membranes by cryogenic electron microscopy, bioRxiv, 2020-02-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe nanoscale organization of biological membranes into structurally and compositionally distinct lateral domains is believed to be central to membrane function. The nature of this organization has remained elusive due to a lack of methods to directly probe nanoscopic membrane features. We show here that cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) can be used to directly image coexisting nanoscopic domains in synthetic and bio-derived membranes without extrinsic probes. Analyzing a series of single-component liposomes composed of synthetic lipids of varying lengths, we demonstrate that cryoEM can distinguish bilayer thickness differences as small as 0.5 Å, comparable to the resolution of small-angle scattering methods. Simulated images from computational models reveal that features in cryoEM images result from a complex interplay between the atomic distribution normal to the plane of the bilayer and imaging parameters. Simulations of phase separated bilayers were used to predict two sources of contrast between coexisting ordered and disordered phases within a single liposome, namely differences in membrane thickness and molecular density. We observe both sources of contrast in biomimetic membranes composed of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol. When extended to isolated mammalian plasma membranes, these methods reveal similar nanoscale lateral heterogeneities. The methods reported here for direct, probe-free imaging of nanodomains in unperturbed membranes open new avenues for investigation of nanoscopic membrane organization.SIGNIFICANCEWe have used cryoEM to achieve direct, probe-free imaging of lateral domains in biomimetic lipid membranes under native conditions and to characterize differences in their structures. First, measurements of membrane thickness in laterally uniform single-component membranes show that cryoEM is capable of sub-angstrom resolution of interleaflet membrane thickness. All-atom simulations are used to predict the cryo-EM appearance of submicron domains in vesicles with coexisting liquid domains and these are quantitatively validated by direct imaging of phase separated membranes. We then extend this approach to observe nanoscopic domains in isolated cellular membranes, comprising the first direct imaging of nanodomains in biomembranes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-resolution cryo-EM using beam-image shift at 200 keV, bioRxiv, 2020-01-22</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTRecent advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data collection utilizes beam-image shift to improve throughput. Despite implementation on well-aligned 300 keV cryo-EM instruments, it remains unknown how well beam-image shift data collection affects data quality on 200 keV instruments and whether any aberrations can be computationally corrected. To test this, we collected and analyzed a cryo-EM dataset of aldolase at 200 keV using beam-image shift. This analysis shows that beam tilt on the instrument initially limited the resolution of aldolase to 5.6Å. After iterative rounds of aberration correction and particle polishing in RELION, we were able to obtain a 2.8Å structure. This analysis indicates that software correction of microscope misalignment can provide a dramatic improvement in resolution.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">vLUME 3D Virtual Reality for Single-molecule Localization Microscopy, bioRxiv, 2020-01-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractSuper-Resolution (SR) Microscopy based on 3D Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is now well established1,2 and its wide-spread adoption has led to the development of more than 36 software packages, dedicated to quantitative evaluation of the spatial and temporal detection of fluorophore photoswitching3. While the initial emphasis in the 3D SMLM field has clearly been on improving resolution and data quality, there is now a marked absence of 3D visualization approaches that enable the straightforward, high-fidelity exploration of this type of data. Inspired by the horological phosphorescence points that illuminate watch-faces in the dark, we present vLUME (Visualization of the Universe in a Micro Environment, pronounced ‘volume’) a free-for-academic-use immersive virtual reality-based (VR) visualization software package purposefully designed to render large 3D-SMLM data sets. vLUME enables robust visualization, segmentation and quantification of millions of fluorescence puncta from any 3D SMLM technique. vLUME has an intuitive user-interface and is compatible with all commercial VR hardware (Oculus RiftQuest and HTC Vive, Supplementary Video 1). vLUME accelerates the analysis of highly complex 3D point-cloud data and the rapid identification of defects that are otherwise neglected in global quality metrics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A processive rotary mechanism couples substrate unfolding and proteolysis in the ClpXP degradation machinery, bioRxiv, 2019-09-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe ClpXP degradation machine consists of a hexameric AAA&#43; unfoldase (ClpX) and a pair of heptameric serine protease rings (ClpP) that unfold, translocate, and subsequently degrade client proteins. ClpXP is an important target for drug development against infectious diseases. Although structures are available for isolated ClpX and ClpP rings, it remains unknown how symmetry mismatched ClpX and ClpP work in tandem for processive substrate translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-bound ClpXP complex from Neisseria meningitidis at 2.3 to 3.3 Å resolution. The structures allow development of a model in which the cyclical hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to concerted motions of ClpX loops that lead to directional substrate translocation and ClpX rotation relative to ClpP. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that AAA&#43; molecular machines generate translocating forces by a common mechanism.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">MINFLUX nanoscopy delivers multicolor nanometer 3D-resolution in (living) cells, bioRxiv, 2019-08-14</h4>
          <p>The ultimate goal of biological superresolution fluorescence microscopy is to provide three-dimensional resolution at the size scale of a fluorescent marker. Here, we show that, by localizing individual switchable fluorophores with a probing doughnut-shaped excitation beam, MINFLUX nanoscopy provides 1–3 nanometer resolution in fixed and living cells. This progress has been facilitated by approaching each fluorophore iteratively with the probing doughnut minimum, making the resolution essentially uniform and isotropic over scalable fields of view. MINFLUX imaging of nuclear pore complexes of a mammalian cell shows that this true nanometer scale resolution is obtained in three dimensions and in two color channels. Relying on fewer detected photons than popular camera-based localization, MINFLUX nanoscopy is poised to open a new chapter in the imaging of protein complexes and distributions in fixed and living cells.</p>
