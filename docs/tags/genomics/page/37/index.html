          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A rapid and robust method for single cell chromatin accessibility profiling, bioRxiv, 2018-04-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is widely used to identify regulatory regions throughout the genome. However, very few studies have been performed at the single cell level (scATAC-seq) due to technical challenges. Here we developed a simple and robust plate-based scATAC-seq method, combining upfront bulk Tn5 tagging with single-nuclei sorting. We demonstrated that our method worked robustly across various systems, including fresh and cryopreserved cells from primary tissues. By profiling over 3,000 splenocytes, we identify distinct immune cell types and reveal cell type-specific regulatory regions and related transcription factors.</p>

          <p>AbstractSingle-cell transcriptomic assays have enabled the de novo reconstruction of lineage differentiation trajectories, along with the characterization of cellular heterogeneity and state transitions. Several methods have been developed for reconstructing developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomic data, but efforts on analyzing single-cell epigenomic data and on trajectory visualization remain limited. Here we present STREAM, an interactive pipeline capable of disentangling and visualizing complex branching trajectories from both single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct RNA Sequencing of the Complete Influenza A Virus Genome, bioRxiv, 2018-04-12</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTFor the first time, a complete genome of an RNA virus has been sequenced in its original form. Previously, RNA was sequenced by the chemical degradation of radiolabelled RNA, a difficult method that produced only short sequences. Instead, RNA has usually been sequenced indirectly by copying it into cDNA, which is often amplified to dsDNA by PCR and subsequently analyzed using a variety of DNA sequencing methods. We designed an adapter to short highly conserved termini of the influenza virus genome to target the (-) sense RNA into a protein nanopore on the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Utilizing this method and total RNA extracted from the allantoic fluid of infected chicken eggs, we demonstrate successful sequencing of the complete influenza virus genome with 100% nucleotide coverage, 99% consensus identity, and 99% of reads mapped to influenza. By utilizing the same methodology we can redesign the adapter in order to expand the targets to include viral mRNA and (&#43;) sense cRNA, which are essential to the viral life cycle. This has the potential to identify and quantify splice variants and base modifications, which are not practically measurable with current methods.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Pushing the limits of de novo genome assembly for complex prokaryotic genomes harboring very long, near identical repeats, bioRxiv, 2018-04-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenerating a complete, de novo genome assembly for prokaryotes is often considered a solved problem. However, we here show that Pseudomonas koreensis P19E3 harbors multiple, near identical repeat pairs up to 70 kilobase pairs in length. Beyond long repeats, the P19E3 assembly was further complicated by a shufflon region. Its complex genome could not be de novo assembled with long reads produced by Pacific Biosciences’ technology, but required very long reads from the Oxford Nanopore Technology. Another important factor for a full genomic resolution was the choice of assembly algorithm.Importantly, a repeat analysis indicated that very complex bacterial genomes represent a general phenomenon beyond Pseudomonas. Roughly 10% of 9331 complete bacterial and a handful of 293 complete archaeal genomes represented this dark matter for de novo genome assembly of prokaryotes. Several of these dark matter genome assemblies contained repeats far beyond the resolution of the sequencing technology employed and likely contain errors, other genomes were closed employing labor-intense steps like cosmid libraries, primer walking or optical mapping. Using very long sequencing reads in combination with assemblers capable of resolving long, near identical repeats will bring most prokaryotic genomes within reach of fast and complete de novo genome assembly.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate functional classification of thousands of BRCA1 variants with saturation genome editing, bioRxiv, 2018-04-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractVariants of uncertain significance (VUS) fundamentally limit the utility of genetic information in a clinical setting. The challenge of VUS is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variants predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Data sharing attenuates this problem but it is unlikely to solve it, as most newly observed variants are exceedingly rare. In lieu of genetic evidence, experimental approaches can be used to functionally characterize VUS. However, to date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been conducted in a post hoc, piecemeal fashion. Here we employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Our assay measures cellular fitness in a haploid human cell line whose survival is dependent on intact BRCA1 function. The resulting function scores for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Sequence-function maps enhanced by parallel measurements of variant effects on mRNA levels reveal mechanisms by which loss-of-function SNVs arise. Hundreds of missense SNVs critical for protein function are identified, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing or transcript stability. We predict that these function scores will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigm can be extended to overcome the challenge of VUS in other genes in which genetic variation is clinically actionable.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia, bioRxiv, 2018-03-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe genetic formation of Central and South Asian populations has been unclear because of an absence of ancient DNA. To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia—consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC—and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.One Sentence SummaryGenome wide ancient DNA from 357 individuals from Central and South Asia sheds new light on the spread of Indo-European languages and parallels between the genetic history of two sub-continents, Europe and South Asia.</p>
