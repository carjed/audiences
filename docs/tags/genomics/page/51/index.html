          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nanopore sequencing and assembly of a human genome with ultra-long reads, bioRxiv, 2017-04-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractNanopore sequencing is a promising technique for genome sequencing due to its portability, ability to sequence long reads from single molecules, and to simultaneously assay DNA methylation. However until recently nanopore sequencing has been mainly applied to small genomes, due to the limited output attainable. We present nanopore sequencing and assembly of the GM12878 UtahCeph human reference genome generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION and R9.4 version chemistry. We generated 91.2 Gb of sequence data (∼30× theoretical coverage) from 39 flowcells. De novo assembly yielded a highly complete and contiguous assembly (NG50 ∼3Mb). We observed considerable variability in homopolymeric tract resolution between different basecallers. The data permitted sensitive detection of both large structural variants and epigenetic modifications. Further we developed a new approach exploiting the long-read capability of this system and found that adding an additional 5×-coverage of ‘ultra-long’ reads (read N50 of 99.7kb) more than doubled the assembly contiguity. Modelling the repeat structure of the human genome predicts extraordinarily contiguous assemblies may be possible using nanopore reads alone. Portable de novo sequencing of human genomes may be important for rapid point-of-care diagnosis of rare genetic diseases and cancer, and monitoring of cancer progression. The complete dataset including raw signal is available as an Amazon Web Services Open Dataset at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comnanopore-wgs-consortiumNA12878&gt;httpsgithub.comnanopore-wgs-consortiumNA12878&lt;jatsext-link&gt;.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Improved de novo Genome Assembly Linked-Read Sequencing Combined with Optical Mapping Produce a High Quality Mammalian Genome at Relatively Low Cost, bioRxiv, 2017-04-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractCurrent short-read methods have come to dominate genome sequencing because they are cost-effective, rapid, and accurate. However, short reads are most applicable when data can be aligned to a known reference. Two new methods for de novo assembly are linked-reads and restriction-site labeled optical maps. We combined commercial applications of these technologies for genome assembly of an endangered mammal, the Hawaiian Monk seal.We show that the linked-reads produced with 10X Genomics Chromium chemistry and assembled with Supernova v1.1 software produced scaffolds with an N50 of 22.23 Mbp with the longest individual scaffold of 84.06 Mbp. When combined with Bionano Genomics optical maps using Bionano RefAligner, the scaffold N50 increased to 29.65 Mbp for a total of 170 hybrid scaffolds, the longest of which was 84.78 Mbp. These results were 161X and 215X, respectively, improved over DISCOVAR de novo assemblies. The quality of the scaffolds was assessed using conserved synteny analysis of both the DNA sequence and predicted seal proteins relative to the genomes of humans and other species. We found large blocks of conserved synteny suggesting that the hybrid scaffolds were high quality. An inversion in one scaffold complementary to human chromosome 6 was found and confirmed by optical maps.The complementarity of linked-reads and optical maps is likely to make the production of high quality genomes more routine and economical and, by doing so, significantly improve our understanding of comparative genome biology.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nanopore Long-Read RNAseq Reveals Widespread Transcriptional Variation Among the Surface Receptors of Individual B cells, bioRxiv, 2017-04-14</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTUnderstanding gene regulation and function requires a genome-wide method capable of capturing both gene expression levels and isoform diversity at the single cell level. Short-read RNAseq, while the current standard for gene expression quantification, is limited in its ability to resolve complex isoforms because it fails to sequence full-length cDNA copies of RNA molecules. Here, we investigated whether RNAseq using the long-read single-molecule Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing technology (ONT RNAseq) would be able to identify and quantify complex isoforms without sacrificing accurate gene expression quantification. After successfully benchmarking our experimental and computational approaches on a mixture of synthetic transcripts, we analyzed individual murine B1a cells using a new cellular indexing strategy. Using the Mandalorion analysis pipeline we developed, we identified thousands of unannotated transcription start and end sites, as well as hundreds of alternative splicing events in these B1a cells. We also identified hundreds of genes expressed across B1a cells that displayed multiple complex isoforms, including several B cell specific surface receptors and the antibody heavy chain (IGH) locus. Our results show that not only can we identify complex isoforms, but also quantify their expression, at the single cell level.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An Integrative Framework for Detecting Structural Variations in Cancer Genomes, bioRxiv, 2017-03-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractStructural variants can contribute to oncogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, yet, despite their importance, the identification of structural variants in cancer genomes remains challenging. Here, we present an integrative framework for comprehensively identifying structural variation in cancer genomes. For the first time, we apply next-generation optical mapping, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), and whole genome sequencing to systematically detect SVs in a variety of cancer cells.Using this approach, we identify and characterize structural variants in up to 29 commonly used normal and cancer cell lines. We find that each method has unique strengths in identifying different classes of structural variants and at different scales, suggesting that integrative approaches are likely the only way to comprehensively identify structural variants in the genome. Studying the impact of the structural variants in cancer cell lines, we identify widespread structural variation events affecting the functions of non-coding sequences in the genome, including the deletion of distal regulatory sequences, alteration of DNA replication timing, and the creation of novel 3D chromatin structural domains.These results underscore the importance of comprehensive structural variant identification and indicate that non-coding structural variation may be an underappreciated mutational process in cancer genomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Regulation of Life Span by The Gut Microbiota in The Short-Lived African Turquoise Killifish, bioRxiv, 2017-03-28</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTGut bacteria occupy the interface between the organism and the external environment, contributing to homeostasis and disease. Yet, the causal role of the gut microbiota during host aging is largely unexplored. Here, using the African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri), a naturally short-lived vertebrate, we show that the gut microbiota plays a key role in modulating vertebrate life span. Recolonizing the gut of middle-age individuals with bacteria from young donors resulted in life span extension and delayed behavioral decline. This intervention prevented the decrease in microbial diversity associated with host aging and maintained a young-like gut bacterial community, characterized by overrepresentation of the key genera Exiguobacterium, Planococcus, Propionigenium and Psychrobacter. Our findings demonstrate that the natural microbial gut community of young individuals can causally induce long-lasting beneficial systemic effects that lead to life span extension in a vertebrate model.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell RNA-seq of human induced pluripotent stem cells reveals cellular heterogeneity and cell state transitions between subpopulations, bioRxiv, 2017-03-23</h4>
          <p>AbstractHeterogeneity of cell states represented in pluripotent cultures have not been described at the transcriptional level. Since gene expression is highly heterogeneous between cells, single-cell RNA sequencing can be used to identify how individual pluripotent cells function. Here, we present results from the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data from 18,787 individual WTC CRISPRi human induced pluripotent stem cells. We developed an unsupervised clustering method, and through this identified four subpopulations distinguishable on the basis of their pluripotent state including a core pluripotent population (48.3%), proliferative (47.8%), early-primed for differentiation (2.8%) and late-primed for differentiation (1.1%). For each subpopulation we were able to identify the genes and pathways that define differences in pluripotent cell states. Our method identified four transcriptionally distinct predictor gene sets comprised of 165 unique genes that denote the specific pluripotency states; and using these sets, we developed a multigenic machine learning prediction method to accurately classify single cells into each of the subpopulations. Compared against a set of established pluripotency markers, our method increases prediction accuracy by 10%, specificity by 20%, and explains a substantially larger proportion of deviance (up to 3-fold) from the prediction model. Finally, we developed an innovative method to predict cells transitioning between subpopulations, and support our conclusions with results from two orthogonal pseudotime trajectory methods.</p>
