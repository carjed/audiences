          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor, bioRxiv, 2019-03-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent developments in experimental technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the profiling a high-dimensional number of genome-wide features in individual cells, inspiring the formation of large-scale data generation projects quantifying unprecedented levels of biological variation at the single-cell level. The data generated in such projects exhibits unique characteristics, including increased sparsity and scale, in terms of both the number of features and the number of samples. Due to these unique characteristics, specialized statistical methods are required along with fast and efficient software implementations in order to successfully derive biological insights. Bioconductor - an open-source, open-development software project based on the R programming language - has pioneered the analysis of such high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, leveraging a rich history of software and methods development that has spanned the era of sequencing. Featuring state-of-the-art computational methods, standardized data infrastructure, and interactive data visualization tools that are all easily accessible as software packages, Bioconductor has made it possible for a diverse audience to analyze data derived from cutting-edge single-cell assays. Here, we present an overview of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis for prospective users and contributors, highlighting the contributions towards this effort made by Bioconductor.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Arrival of Steppe and Iranian Related Ancestry in the Islands of the Western Mediterranean, bioRxiv, 2019-03-21</h4>
          <p>A series of studies have documented how Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry reached central Europe by at least 2500 BCE, while Iranian farmer-related ancestry was present in Aegean Europe by at least 1900 BCE. However, the spread of these ancestries into the western Mediterranean where they have contributed to many populations living today remains poorly understood. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA from the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals with reported data from these islands from 3 to 52. We obtained data from the oldest skeleton excavated from the Balearic islands (dating to ∼2400 BCE), and show that this individual had substantial Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry; however, later Balearic individuals had less Steppe heritage reflecting geographic heterogeneity or immigration from groups with more European first farmer-related ancestry. In Sicily, Steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived by ∼2200 BCE and likely came at least in part from Spain as it was associated with Iberian-specific Y chromosomes. In Sicily, Iranian-related ancestry also arrived by the Middle Bronze Age, thus revealing that this ancestry type, which was ubiquitous in the Aegean by this time, also spread further west prior to the classical period of Greek expansion. In Sardinia, we find no evidence of either eastern ancestry type in the Nuragic Bronze Age, but show that Iranian-related ancestry arrived by at least ∼300 BCE and Steppe ancestry arrived by ∼300 CE, joined at that time or later by North African ancestry. These results falsify the view that the people of Sardinia are isolated descendants of Europe’s first farmers. Instead, our results show that the island’s admixture history since the Bronze Age is as complex as that in many other parts of Europe.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Determinants of transcription factor regulatory range, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo characterize the genomic distances over which transcription factors (TFs) influence gene expression, we examined thousands of TF and histone modification ChIP-seq datasets and thousands of gene expression profiles. A model integrating these data revealed two classes of TF one with short-range regulatory influence, the other with long-range regulatory influence. The two TF classes also had distinct chromatin-binding preferences and auto-regulatory properties. The regulatory range of a single TF bound within different topologically associating domains (TADs) depended on intrinsic TAD properties such as local gene density and GC content, but also on the TAD chromatin state in specific cell types. Our results provide evidence that most TFs belong to one of these two functional classes, and that the regulatory range of long-range TFs is chromatin-state dependent. Thus, consideration of TF type, distance-to-target, and chromatin context is likely important in identifying TF regulatory targets and interpreting GWAS and eQTL SNPs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Gene regulatory network reconstruction using single-cell RNA sequencing of barcoded genotypes in diverse environments, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding how gene expression programs are controlled requires identifying regulatory relationships between transcription factors and target genes. Gene regulatory networks are typically constructed from gene expression data acquired following genetic perturbation or environmental stimulus. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) captures the gene expression state of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment, offering advantages in combinatorial experimental design, large numbers of independent measurements, and accessing the interaction between the cell cycle and environmental responses that is hidden by population-level analysis of gene expression. To leverage these advantages, we developed a method for transcriptionally barcoding gene deletion mutants and performing scRNAseq in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We pooled diverse genotypes in 11 different environmental conditions and determined their expression state by sequencing 38,285 individual cells. We developed, and benchmarked, a framework for learning gene regulatory networks from scRNAseq data that incorporates multitask learning and constructed a global gene regulatory network comprising 12,018 interactions. Our study establishes a general approach to gene regulatory network reconstruction from scRNAseq data that can be employed in any organism.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ribosome profiling at isoform level reveals an evolutionary conserved impact of differential splicing on the proteome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe differential production of transcript isoforms from gene loci is a key cellular mechanism. Yet, its impact in protein production remains an open question. Here, we describe ORQAS (ORF quantification pipeline for alternative splicing) a new pipeline for the translation quantification of individual transcript isoforms using ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (Ribosome profiling). We found evidence of translation for 40-50% of the expressed transcript isoforms in human and mouse, with 53% of the expressed genes having more than one translated isoform in human, 33% in mouse. Differential analysis revealed that about 40% of the splicing changes at RNA level were concordant with changes in translation, with 21.7% of changes at RNA level and 17.8% at translational level conserved between human and mouse. Furthermore, orthologous cassette exons preserving the directionality of the change were found enriched in microexons in a comparison between glia and glioma, and were conserved between human and mouse. ORQAS leverages ribosome profiling to uncover a widespread and evolutionary conserved impact of differential splicing on the translation of isoforms and in particular, of microexon-containing ones. ORQAS is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comcomprnaorqas&gt;httpsgithub.comcomprnaorqas&lt;jatsext-link&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An open resource of structural variation for medical and population genetics, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYStructural variants (SVs) rearrange the linear and three-dimensional organization of the genome, which can have profound consequences in evolution, diversity, and disease. As national biobanks, human disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population references for small variants (i.e., SNVs &amp;amp; indels) in protein-coding genes, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. However, no comparable large-scale reference maps for SVs exist to date. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis, in the general population. The mutation rates and densities of SVs were non-uniform across chromosomes and SV classes. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reflect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. The average genome in gnomAD-SV harbored 8,202 SVs, and approximately eight genes altered by rare SVs. When incorporating these data with pLoF SNVs, we estimate that SVs comprise at least 25% of all rare pLoF events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼132 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental finding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted differences in frequencies across populations and confirmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants. In total, gnomAD-SV includes at least one CNV covering 57% of the genome, while the remaining 43% is significantly enriched for CNVs found in tumors and individuals with developmental disorders. However, current sample sizes remain markedly underpowered to establish estimates of SV constraint on the level of individual genes or noncoding loci. The gnomAD-SV resources have been integrated into the gnomAD browser (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&gt;httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), where users can freely explore this dataset without restrictions on reuse, which will have broad utility in population genetics, disease association, and diagnostic screening.</p>
