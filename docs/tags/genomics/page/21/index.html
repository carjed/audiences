          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Building gene regulatory networks from scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq using Linked Self-Organizing Maps, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractRapid advances in single-cell assays have outpaced methods for analysis of those data types. Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of single-cells.</p>

          <p>Cohort profile in a nutshell East London Genes &amp;amp; Health (ELGH) is a large scale, community genomics and health study (to date &amp;gt;34,000 volunteers; target 100,000 volunteers). ELGH was set up in 2015 to gain deeper understanding of health and disease, and underlying genetic influences, in British-Bangladeshi and British-Pakistani people living in east London. ELGH prioritises studies in areas important to, and identified by, the community it represents. Current priorities include cardiometabolic diseases and mental illness, these being of notably high prevalence and severity. However studies in any scientific area are possible, subject to community advisory group and ethical approval. ELGH combines health data science (using linked UK National Health Service (NHS) electronic health record data) with exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping to elucidate the genetic influence on health and disease, including the contribution from high rates of parental relatedness on rare genetic variation and homozygosity (autozygosity), in two understudied ethnic groups. Linkage to longitudinal health record data enables both retrospective and prospective analyses. Through Stage 2 studies, ELGH offers researchers the opportunity to undertake recall-by-genotype andor recall-by-phenotype studies on volunteers. Sub-cohort, trial-within-cohort, and other study designs are possible. ELGH is a fully collaborative, open access resource, open to academic and life sciences industry scientific research partners.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Local epigenomic state cannot discriminate interacting and non-interacting enhancerâ€“promoter pairs with high accuracy, bioRxiv, 2018-09-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe report an overfitting issue in recent machine learning formulations of the enhancer-promoter interaction problem arising from the fact that many enhancer-promoter pairs share features. Cross- fold validation schemes which do not correctly separate these feature sharing enhancer-promoter pairs into one test set report high accuracy, which is actually due to overfitting. Cross-fold validation schemes which properly segregate pairs with shared features show markedly reduced ability to predict enhancer-promoter interactions from epigenomic state. Parameter scans with multiple models indicate that local epigenomic features of individual pairs of enhancers and promoters cannot distinguish those pairs that interact from those which do with high accuracy, suggesting that additional information is required to predict enhancer-promoter interactions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-throughput targeted long-read single cell sequencing reveals the clonal and transcriptional landscape of lymphocytes, bioRxiv, 2018-09-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractHigh-throughput single-cell RNA-Sequencing is a powerful technique for gene expression profiling of complex and heterogeneous cellular populations such as the immune system. However, these methods only provide short-read sequence from one end of a cDNA template, making them poorly suited to the investigation of gene-regulatory events such as mRNA splicing, adaptive immune responses or somatic genome evolution. To address this challenge, we have developed a method that combines targeted long-read sequencing with short-read based transcriptome profiling of barcoded single cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We use Repertoire And Gene Expression sequencing (RAGE-seq) to accurately characterize full-length T cell (TCR) and B cell (BCR) receptor sequences and transcriptional profiles of more than 7,138 lymphocytes sampled from the primary tumour and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient. With this method we show that somatic mutation, alternate splicing and clonal evolution of T and B lymphocytes can be tracked across these tissue compartments. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is an accessible and cost-effective method for high-throughput deep single cell profiling, applicable to a wide range of biological challenges.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A transposable element insertion is the switch between alternative life history strategies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-24</h4>
          <p>Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs in wild populations. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS individuals have either yelloworange or white wings. Here we map the genetic basis of the ALHS switch in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPRCas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find morph-specific specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. These findings characterize a novel mechanism for a female-limited ALHS and show that the switch arises via recruitment of a transcription factor previously known for its function in cell fate determination in pigment cells of the retina.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Revealing multi-scale population structure in large cohorts, bioRxiv, 2018-09-23</h4>
          <p>Genetic structure in large cohorts results from technical, sampling and demographic variation. Visualisation is therefore a first step in most genomic analyses. However, existing data exploration methods struggle with unbalanced sampling and the many scales of population structure. We investigate an approach to dimension reduction of genomic data that combines principal components analysis (PCA) with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to succinctly illustrate population structure in large cohorts and capture their relationships on local and global scales. Using data from large-scale genomic datasets, we demonstrate that PCA-UMAP effectively clusters closely related individuals while placing them in a global continuum of genetic variation. This approach reveals previously overlooked subpopulations within the American Hispanic population and fine-scale relationships between geography, genotypes, and phenotypes in the UK population. This opens new lines of investigation for demographic research and statistical genetics. Given its small computational cost, PCA-UMAP also provides a general-purpose approach to exploratory analysis in population-scale datasets.</p>
