          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Characterising the loss-of-function impact of 5&#39; untranslated region variants in whole genome sequence data from 15,708 individuals, bioRxiv, 2019-02-08</h4>
          <p>Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are important tissue-specific cis-regulators of protein translation. Although isolated case reports have shown that variants that create or disrupt uORFs can cause disease, genetic sequencing approaches typically focus on protein-coding regions and ignore these variants. Here, we describe a systematic genome-wide study of variants that create and disrupt human uORFs, and explore their role in human disease using 15,708 whole genome sequences collected by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) project. We show that 14,897 variants that create new start codons upstream of the canonical coding sequence (CDS), and 2,406 variants disrupting the stop site of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the CDS show signals of selection equivalent to coding loss-of-function variants, and uORF-perturbing variants are under strong selection when arising upstream of known disease genes and genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where perturbation of uORFs is likely to represent an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in families with neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an important and under-recognised functional class that can contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data to study the deleteriousness of specific classes of non-coding variants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Characterization of prevalence and health consequences of uniparental disomy in four million individuals from the general population, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06</h4>
          <p>Meiotic nondisjunction and resulting aneuploidy can lead to severe health consequences in humans.  Aneuploidy rescue can restore euploidy but may result in uniparental disomy (UPD), the inheritance of both homologs of a chromosome from one parent with no representative copy from the other. Current understanding of UPD is limited to ~3,300 cases for which UPD was associated with clinical presentation due to imprinting disorders or recessive diseases. Thus, the prevalence of UPD and its phenotypic consequences in the general population are unknown. We searched for instances of UPD in over four million consented research participants from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and 431,094 UK Biobank participants. Using computationally detected DNA segments identical-by-descent (IBD) and runs of homozygosity (ROH), we identified 675 instances of UPD across both databases. Here we present the first characterization of UPD prevalence in the general population, a machine-learning framework to detect UPD using ROH, and a novel association between autism and UPD of chromosome 22.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The functional landscape of the human phosphoproteome, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06</h4>
          <p>Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification regulating protein function in almost all cellular processes. While tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites have been identified in human cells to date, the extent and functional importance of the phosphoproteome remains largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed 6,801 publicly available phospho-enriched mass spectrometry proteomics experiments, creating a state-of-the-art phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. To prioritize functional sites, 59 features indicative of proteomic, structural, regulatory or evolutionary relevance were integrated into a single functional score using machine learning. We demonstrate how this prioritization identifies regulatory phosphosites across different molecular mechanisms and pinpoint genetic susceptibilities at a genomic scale. Several novel regulatory phosphosites were experimentally validated including a role in neuronal differentiation for phosphosites present in the SWISNF SMARCC2 complex member. The scored reference phosphoproteome and its annotations identify the most relevant phosphorylations for a given process or disease addressing a major bottleneck in cell signaling studies.</p>

          <p>Single cell technologies for profiling tissues or even entire organisms are rapidly being adopted. However, the manual process by which cell types are typically annotated in the resulting data is labor-intensive and increasingly rate-limiting for the field. Here we describe Garnett, an algorithm and accompanying software for rapidly annotating cell types in scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets, based on an interpretable, hierarchical markup language of cell type-specific genes. Garnett successfully classifies cell types in tissue and whole organism datasets, as well as across species.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Islands of retroelements are the major components of Drosophila centromeres, bioRxiv, 2019-02-02</h4>
          <p>Centromeres are essential chromosomal regions that mediate kinetochore assembly and spindle attachments during cell division. Despite their functional conservation, centromeres are amongst the most rapidly evolving genomic regions and can shape karyotype evolution and speciation across taxa. Although significant progress has been made in identifying centromere-associated proteins, the highly repetitive centromeres of metazoans have been refractory to DNA sequencing and assembly, leaving large gaps in our understanding of their functional organization and evolution. Here, we identify the sequence composition and organization of the centromeres of Drosophila melanogaster by combining long-read sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation for the centromeric histone CENP-A, and high-resolution chromatin fiber imaging. Contrary to previous models that heralded satellite repeats as the major functional components, we demonstrate that functional centromeres form on islands of complex DNA sequences enriched in retroelements that are flanked by large arrays of satellite repeats. Each centromere displays distinct size and arrangement of its DNA elements but is similar in composition overall. We discover that a specific retroelement, G2Jockey-3, is the most highly enriched sequence in CENP-A chromatin and is the only element shared among all centromeres. G2Jockey-3 is also associated with CENP-A in the sister species Drosophila simulans, revealing an unexpected conservation despite the reported turnover of centromeric satellite DNA. Our work reveals the DNA sequence identity of the active centromeres of a premier model organism and implicates retroelements as conserved features of centromeric DNA.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Self-reporting transposons enable simultaneous readout of gene expression and transcription factor binding in single cells, bioRxiv, 2019-02-02</h4>
          <p>In situ assays of transcription factor (TF) binding are confounded by cellular heterogeneity and represent averaged profiles in complex tissues. Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) is capable of resolving different cell types based on gene expression profiles, but no technology exists to directly link specific cell types to the binding pattern of TFs in those cell types. Here, we present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and their use in single cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously capturing gene expression profiles and mapping TF binding sites in single cells. First, we show how the genomic locations of SRTs can be recovered from mRNA. Next, we demonstrate that SRTs deposited by the piggyBac transposase can be used to map the genome-wide localization of the TFs SP1, through a direct fusion of the two proteins, and BRD4, through its native affinity for piggyBac. We then present the scCC method, which maps SRTs from scRNA-seq libraries, thus enabling concomitant identification of cell types and TF binding sites in those same cells. As a proof-of-concept, we show recovery of cell type-specific BRD4 and SP1 binding sites from cultured cells. Finally, we map Brd4 binding sites in the mouse cortex at single cell resolution, thus establishing a new technique for studying TF biology in situ.</p>
