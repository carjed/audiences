          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Genomics of Selfing in Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) Catching Purging in the Act, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTIn plants, self-fertilization is both an important reproductive strategy and a valuable genetic tool. In theory, selfing increases homozygosity at a rate of 0.50 per generation. Increased homozygosity can uncover recessive deleterious variants and lead to inbreeding depression, unless it is countered by the loss of these variants by genetic purging. Here we investigated the dynamics of purging on genomic scale by testing three predictions. The first was that heterozygous, putatively deleterious SNPs were preferentially lost from the genome during continued selfing. The second was that the loss of deleterious SNPs varied as a function of recombination rate, because recombination increases the efficacy of selection by uncoupling linked variants. Finally, we predicted that genome size (GS) decreases during selfing, due to the purging of deleterious transposable element (TE) insertions. We tested these three predictions by following GS and SNP variants in a series of selfed maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) lines over six generations. In these lines, putatively deleterious alleles were purged, and purging was more pronounced in highly recombining regions. Homozygosity increased more slowly than expected; instead of increasing by 50% each generation, it increased by 35% to 40%. Finally, three lines showed dramatic decreases in GS, losing an average of 398 Mb from their genomes over the short timeframe of our experiment. TEs were the principal component of loss, and GS loss was more likely for lineages that began with more TE and more chromosomal knob repeats. Overall, this study documented remarkable GS loss â€“ as much DNA as three Arabidopsis thaliana genomes, on average - in only a few generations of selfing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Interactions between the gut microbiome and host gene regulation in cystic fibrosis, bioRxiv, 2019-04-03</h4>
          <p>AbstractCystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians. It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to poor hydration of mucus and impairment of the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive organ functions. Advancements in medical care have lead to markedly increased longevity of patients with CF, but new complications have emerged, such as early onset of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although the pathogenesis of CRC in CF remains unclear, altered host-microbe interactions might play a critical role. Here, we characterize the changes in the gut microbiome and host gene expression in colonic mucosa of CF patients relative to healthy controls. We find that CF patients show decreased microbial diversity, decreased abundance of taxa such as Butyricimonas, Sutterella, and Ruminococcaceae, and increased abundance of other taxa, such as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. We find that 1543 genes, including CFTR, show differential expression in the colon of CF patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, we find that these genes are enriched with functions related to gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, such as metastasis of CRC, tumor suppression, cellular dysfunction, p53 and mTOR signaling pathways. Lastly, we modeled associations between relative abundances of specific bacterial taxa in the gut mucosa and host gene expression, and identified CRC-related genes, including LCN2 and DUOX2, for which gene expression is correlated with the abundance of CRC-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae and Veillonella. Our results provide new insight into the role of host-microbe interactions in the etiology of CRC in CF.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Common DNA sequence variation influences 3-dimensional conformation of the human genome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe 3-dimensional (3D) conformation of chromatin inside the nucleus is integral to a variety of nuclear processes including transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. Aberrations in 3D chromatin conformation have been implicated in developmental abnormalities and cancer. Despite the importance of 3D chromatin conformation to cellular function and human health, little is known about how 3D chromatin conformation varies in the human population, or whether DNA sequence variation between individuals influences 3D chromatin conformation. To address these questions, we performed Hi-C on Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from 20 individuals. We identified thousands of regions across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength, contact insulation, contact directionality and density of localciscontacts. We mapped hundreds of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes as well as complex disease risk. Our results demonstrate that common DNA sequence variants can influence 3D chromatin conformation, pointing to a more pervasive role for 3D chromatin conformation in human phenotypic variation than previously recognized.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor, bioRxiv, 2019-03-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent developments in experimental technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the profiling a high-dimensional number of genome-wide features in individual cells, inspiring the formation of large-scale data generation projects quantifying unprecedented levels of biological variation at the single-cell level. The data generated in such projects exhibits unique characteristics, including increased sparsity and scale, in terms of both the number of features and the number of samples. Due to these unique characteristics, specialized statistical methods are required along with fast and efficient software implementations in order to successfully derive biological insights. Bioconductor - an open-source, open-development software project based on the R programming language - has pioneered the analysis of such high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, leveraging a rich history of software and methods development that has spanned the era of sequencing. Featuring state-of-the-art computational methods, standardized data infrastructure, and interactive data visualization tools that are all easily accessible as software packages, Bioconductor has made it possible for a diverse audience to analyze data derived from cutting-edge single-cell assays. Here, we present an overview of single-cell RNA sequencing analysis for prospective users and contributors, highlighting the contributions towards this effort made by Bioconductor.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Arrival of Steppe and Iranian Related Ancestry in the Islands of the Western Mediterranean, bioRxiv, 2019-03-21</h4>
          <p>A series of studies have documented how Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry reached central Europe by at least 2500 BCE, while Iranian farmer-related ancestry was present in Aegean Europe by at least 1900 BCE. However, the spread of these ancestries into the western Mediterranean where they have contributed to many populations living today remains poorly understood. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA from the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals with reported data from these islands from 3 to 52. We obtained data from the oldest skeleton excavated from the Balearic islands (dating to âˆ¼2400 BCE), and show that this individual had substantial Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry; however, later Balearic individuals had less Steppe heritage reflecting geographic heterogeneity or immigration from groups with more European first farmer-related ancestry. In Sicily, Steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived by âˆ¼2200 BCE and likely came at least in part from Spain as it was associated with Iberian-specific Y chromosomes. In Sicily, Iranian-related ancestry also arrived by the Middle Bronze Age, thus revealing that this ancestry type, which was ubiquitous in the Aegean by this time, also spread further west prior to the classical period of Greek expansion. In Sardinia, we find no evidence of either eastern ancestry type in the Nuragic Bronze Age, but show that Iranian-related ancestry arrived by at least âˆ¼300 BCE and Steppe ancestry arrived by âˆ¼300 CE, joined at that time or later by North African ancestry. These results falsify the view that the people of Sardinia are isolated descendants of Europeâ€™s first farmers. Instead, our results show that the islandâ€™s admixture history since the Bronze Age is as complex as that in many other parts of Europe.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Determinants of transcription factor regulatory range, bioRxiv, 2019-03-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo characterize the genomic distances over which transcription factors (TFs) influence gene expression, we examined thousands of TF and histone modification ChIP-seq datasets and thousands of gene expression profiles. A model integrating these data revealed two classes of TF one with short-range regulatory influence, the other with long-range regulatory influence. The two TF classes also had distinct chromatin-binding preferences and auto-regulatory properties. The regulatory range of a single TF bound within different topologically associating domains (TADs) depended on intrinsic TAD properties such as local gene density and GC content, but also on the TAD chromatin state in specific cell types. Our results provide evidence that most TFs belong to one of these two functional classes, and that the regulatory range of long-range TFs is chromatin-state dependent. Thus, consideration of TF type, distance-to-target, and chromatin context is likely important in identifying TF regulatory targets and interpreting GWAS and eQTL SNPs.</p>
