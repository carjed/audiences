          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comparative genomics of the tardigrades Hypsibius dujardini and Ramazzottius varieornatus, bioRxiv, 2017-03-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTTardigrada, a phylum of meiofaunal organisms, have been at the center of discussions of the evolution of Metazoa, the biology of survival in extreme environments, and the role of horizontal gene transfer in animal evolution. Tardigrada are placed as sisters to Arthropoda and Onychophora (velvet worms) in the superphylum Ecdysozoa by morphological analyses, but many molecular phylogenies fail to recover this relationship. This tension between molecular and morphological understanding may be very revealing of the mode and patterns of evolution of major groups. Similar to bdelloid rotifers, nematodes and other animals of the water film, limno-terrestrial tardigrades display extreme cryptobiotic abilities, including anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis. These extremophile behaviors challenge understanding of normal, aqueous physiology how does a multicellular organism avoid lethal cellular collapse in the absence of liquid water? Meiofaunal species have been reported to have elevated levels of HGT events, but how important this is in evolution, and in particular in the evolution of extremophile physiology, is unclear. To address these questions, we resequenced and reassembled the genome of Hypsibius dujardini, a limno-terrestrial tardigrade that can undergo anhydrobiosis only after extensive pre-exposure to drying conditions, and compared it to the genome of Ramazzottius varieornatus, a related species with tolerance to rapid desiccation. The two species had contrasting gene expression responses to anhydrobiosis, with major transcriptional change in H. dujardini but limited regulation in R. varieornatus. We identified few horizontally transferred genes, but some of these were shown to be involved in entry into anhydrobiosis. Whole-genome molecular phylogenies supported a Tardigrada&#43;Nematoda relationship over Tardigrada&#43;Arthropoda, but rare genomic changes tended to support Tardigrada&#43;Arthropoda.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell developmental trajectories, bioRxiv, 2017-02-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractOrganizing single cells along a developmental trajectory has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how gene regulation governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex single-cell trajectories with two or more branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, which uses reversed graph embedding to reconstruct single-cell trajectories in a fully unsupervised manner. Monocle 2 learns an explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory. Monocle 2 is thus a powerful tool for analyzing cell fate decisions with single-cell genomics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell epigenomics maps the continuous regulatory landscape of human hematopoietic differentiation, bioRxiv, 2017-02-22</h4>
          <p>AbstractNormal human hematopoiesis involves cellular differentiation of multipotent cells into progressively more lineage-restricted states. While epigenomic landscapes of this process have been explored in immunophenotypically-defined populations, the single-cell regulatory variation that defines hematopoietic differentiation has been hidden by ensemble averaging. We generated single-cell chromatin accessibility landscapes across 8 populations of immunophenotypically-defined human hematopoietic cell types. Using bulk chromatin accessibility profiles to scaffold our single-cell data analysis, we constructed an epigenomic landscape of human hematopoiesis and characterized epigenomic heterogeneity within phenotypically sorted populations to find epigenomic lineage-bias toward different developmental branches in multipotent stem cell states. We identify and isolate sub-populations within classically-defined granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and use ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to confirm that GMPs are epigenomically and transcriptomically heterogeneous. Furthermore, we identified transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements linked to changes in chromatin accessibility within cellular populations and across a continuous myeloid developmental trajectory, and observe relatively simple TF motif dynamics give rise to a broad diversity of accessibility dynamics at cis-regulatory elements. Overall, this work provides a template for exploration of complex regulatory dynamics in primary human tissues at the ultimate level of granular specificity – the single cell.One Sentence SummarySingle cell chromatin accessibility reveals a high-resolution, continuous landscape of regulatory variation in human hematopoiesis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cas9-Assisted Targeting of CHromosome segments (CATCH) for targeted nanopore sequencing and optical genome mapping, bioRxiv, 2017-02-21</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTVariations in the genetic code, from single point mutations to large structural or copy number alterations, influence susceptibility, onset, and progression of genetic diseases and tumor transformation. Next-generation sequencing analysis is unable to reliably capture aberrations larger than the typical sequencing read length of several hundred bases. Long-read, single-molecule sequencing methods such as SMRT and nanopore sequencing can address larger variations, but require costly whole genome analysis. Here we describe a method for isolation and enrichment of a large genomic region of interest for targeted analysis based on Cas9 excision of two sites flanking the target region and isolation of the excised DNA segment by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. The isolated target remains intact and is ideally suited for optical genome mapping and long-read sequencing at high coverage. In addition, analysis is performed directly on native genomic DNA that retains genetic and epigenetic composition without amplification bias. This method enables detection of mutations and structural variants as well as detailed analysis by generation of hybrid scaffolds composed of optical maps and sequencing data at a fraction of the cost of whole genome sequencing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genes Affecting Vocal and Facial Anatomy Went Through Extensive Regulatory Divergence in Modern Humans, bioRxiv, 2017-02-09</h4>
          <p>SummaryRegulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.</p>

          <p>AbstractIndigenous populations of the Americas experienced high mortality rates during the early contact period as a result of infectious diseases, many of which were introduced by Europeans. Most of the pathogenic agents that caused these outbreaks remain unknown. Using a metagenomic tool called MALT to search for traces of ancient pathogen DNA, we were able to identifySalmonella entericain individuals buried in an early contact era epidemic cemetery at Teposcolula-Yucundaa, Oaxaca in southern Mexico. This cemetery is linked to the 1545-1550 CE epidemic locally known as “cocoliztli”, the cause of which has been debated for over a century. Here we present two reconstructed ancient genomes forSalmonella entericasubsp.entericaserovar Paratyphi C, a bacterial cause of enteric fever. We propose thatS.Paratyphi C contributed to the population decline during the 1545cocoliztlioutbreak in Mexico.One Sentence SummaryGenomic evidence of enteric fever identified in an indigenous population from early contact period Mexico.</p>
