          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coron-avirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis, bioRxiv, 2018-12-01</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTSequence analyses of RNA virus genomes remain challenging due to the exceptional genetic plasticity of these viruses. Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses that are generally referred to as ‘quasispecies’. Although standard (short-read) sequencing technologies allow to readily determine consensus sequences for these ‘quasispecies’, it is far more difficult to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions that may be present in these virus populations. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach without any amplification step to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus representing one of the largest RNA virus genomes known to date.Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (~26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb) was reconstructed. Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which does not require reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. We also show how supplementary short-read sequencing (Illumina) can be used to reduce the error rate of nanopore sequencing.Even though a number of technical challenges remain to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of the nanopore technology, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Sex differences in gene expression in the human fetal brain, bioRxiv, 2018-11-30</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWidespread structural, chemical and molecular differences have been reported between the male and female human brain. Although several neurodevelopmental disorders are more commonly diagnosed in males, little is known regarding sex differences in early human brain development. Here, we used RNA sequencing data from a large collection of human brain samples from the second trimester of gestation (N = 120) to assess sex biases in gene expression within the human fetal brain. In addition to 43 genes (102 Ensembl transcripts) transcribed from the Y-chromosome in males, we detected sex differences in the expression of 2558 autosomal genes (2723 Ensembl transcripts) and 155 genes on the X-chromosome (207 Ensembl transcripts) at a false discovery rate (FDR) &amp;lt; 0.1. Genes exhibiting sex-biased expression in human fetal brain are enriched for high-confidence risk genes for autism and other developmental disorders. Male-biased genes are enriched for expression in neural progenitor cells, whereas female-biased genes are enriched for expression in Cajal-Retzius cells and glia. All gene- and transcript-level data are provided as an online resource (available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpfgen.psycm.cf.ac.ukFBSeq1&gt;httpfgen.psycm.cf.ac.ukFBSeq1&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) through which researchers can search, download and visualize data pertaining to sex biases in gene expression during early human brain development.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Base editing generates substantial off-target single nucleotide variants, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenome editing tools including CRISPRCas9 and base editors hold great promise for correcting pathogenic mutations. Unbiased genome-wide off-target effects of the editing in mammalian cells is required before clinical applications, but determination of the extent of off-target effects has been difficult due to the existence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals. Here, we developed a method named GOTI (Genome-wide Off-target analysis by Two-cell embryo Injection) to detect off-target mutations without interference of SNPs. We applied GOTI to both the CRISPR-Cas9 and base editing (BE3) systems by editing one blastomere of the two-cell mouse embryo and then compared whole genome sequences of progeny-cell populations at E14.5 stage. Sequence analysis of edited and non-edited cell progenies showed that undesired off-target single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are rare (average 10.5) in CRISPR-edited mouse embryos, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, BE3 editing induced over 20-fold higher SNVs (average 283), raising the concern of using base-editing approaches for biomedical application.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Scaling computational genomics to millions of individuals with GPUs, bioRxiv, 2018-11-14</h4>
          <p>Current genomics methods were designed to handle tens to thousands of samples, but will soon need to scale to millions to keep up with the pace of data and hypothesis generation in biomedical science. Moreover, costs associated with processing these growing datasets will become prohibitive without improving the computational efficiency and scalability of methods. Here, we show that recently developed machine-learning libraries (TensorFlow and PyTorch) facilitate implementation of genomics methods for GPUs and significantly accelerate computations. To demonstrate this, we re-implemented methods for two commonly performed computational genomics tasks QTL mapping and Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization. Our implementations ran &amp;gt; 200 times faster than current CPU-based versions, and these analyses are ~5-10 fold cheaper on GPUs due to the vastly shorter runtimes. We anticipate that the accessibility of these libraries, and the improvements in run-time will lead to a transition to GPU-based implementations for a wide range of computational genomics methods.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTHigh throughput cDNA sequencing technologies have dramatically advanced our understanding of transcriptome complexity and regulation. However, these methods lose information contained in biological RNA because the copied reads are often short and because modifications are not carried forward in cDNA. We address these limitations using a native poly(A) RNA sequencing strategy developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Our study focused on poly(A) RNA from the human cell line GM12878, generating 9.9 million aligned sequence reads. These native RNA reads had an aligned N50 length of 1294 bases, and a maximum aligned length of over 21,000 bases. A total of 78,199 high-confidence isoforms were identified by combining long nanopore reads with short higher accuracy Illumina reads. We describe strategies for assessing 3′ poly(A) tail length, base modifications and transcript haplotypes from nanopore RNA data. Together, these nanopore-based techniques are poised to deliver new insights into RNA biology.DISCLOSURESMA holds shares in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MA is a paid consultant to ONT.

          <p>ABSTRACTRapid technological progress in the recent years has allowed the high-throughput interrogation of different types of biomolecules from single cells. Combining several of these readouts into integrated multi-omic assays is essential to comprehensively understand and model cellular processes. Here, we report the development of Expanded CRISPR-compatible Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell transcriptome, immune receptor clonotypes, surface markers, sample identity and sgRNAs. We demonstrate the use of ECCITE-seq to directly and efficiently capture sgRNA molecules and measure their effects on gene expression and protein levels, opening the possibility of performing high throughput single cell CRISPR screens with multimodal readout using existing libraries and commonly used vectors. Finally, by utilizing the combined phenotyping of clonotype and cell surface markers in immune cells, we apply ECCITE to study a lymphoma sample to discriminate cells and define molecular signatures of malignant cells within a heterogeneous population.</p>
