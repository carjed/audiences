          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The whale shark genome reveals how genomic and physiological properties scale with body size, bioRxiv, 2018-10-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe endangered whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is the largest fish on Earth and is a long-lived member of the ancient Elasmobranchii clade. To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 81 animals and yeast. We examined scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic features also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture GC content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with lifespan. Among these were very long gene length, due to large introns highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like LINEs, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale shark’s genome had an expansion of gene families related to fatty acid metabolism and neurogenesis, with the slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan, and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.</p>

          <p>AbstractA central challenge in human genomics is to understand the cellular, evolutionary, and clinical significance of genetic variants. Here we introduce a unified population-genetic and machine-learning model, called Linear Allele-Specific Selection InferencE (LASSIE), for estimating the fitness effects of all potential single-nucleotide variants, based on polymorphism data and predictive genomic features. We applied LASSIE to 51 high-coverage genome sequences annotated with 33 genomic features, and constructed a map of allele-specific selection coefficients across all protein-coding sequences in the human genome. We show that this map is informative about both human evolution and disease.</p>

          <p>AbstractRealising the potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for drug discovery, disease modelling and cell therapy requires an understanding of variability across iPSC lines. While previous studies have characterized iPS cell lines genetically and transcriptionally, little is known about the variability of the iPSC proteome. Here, we present the first comprehensive proteomic iPSC dataset, analysing 202 iPSC lines derived from 151 donors. We characterise the major genetic determinants affecting proteome and transcriptome variation across iPSC lines and identify key regulatory mechanisms affecting variation in protein abundance. Our data identified &amp;gt;700 human iPSC protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs). We mapped trans regulatory effects, identifying an important role for protein-protein interactions. We discovered that pQTLs show increased enrichment in disease-linked GWAS variants, compared with RNA-based eQTLs.</p>

          <p>AbstractUnderstanding the genomic basis of inherited respiratory disorders can assist in the clinical management of individuals with these rare disorders. We apply whole genome sequencing for the discovery of disease-causing variants in the non-coding regions of known disease genes for two individuals with inherited respiratory disorders. We describe analysis strategies to pinpoint candidate non-coding variants within the non-coding genome and demonstrate aberrant RNA splicing as a result of deep intronic variants in DNAH11 and CFTR. These findings confirm clinical diagnoses of primary ciliary dyskinesia and cystic fibrosis, respectively.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate characterization of expanded tandem repeat length and sequence through whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractTandem repeats (TRs) can cause disease through their length, sequence motif interruptions, and nucleotide modifications. For many TRs, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a VNTR in ABCA7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the TR size and sequence directly on raw PromethION current data.We report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh DNA extractions, DNA shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All ABCA7 VNTR alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of TR length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, DNA strand effects andor inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel NanoSatellite algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw PromethION current data, achieved more than 90% accuracy and high precision (5.6% relative standard deviation) of TR length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative TR sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of TR sequence and distinction of VNTR alleles with homozygous length.In conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded ABCA7 VNTR alleles in Alzheimer’s disease, and opening new opportunities for TR research.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Analyses of Neanderthal introgression suggest that Levantine and southern Arabian populations have a shared population history, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractObjectivesModern humans are thought to have interbred with Neanderthals in the Near East soon after modern humans dispersed out of Africa. This introgression event likely took place in either the Levant or southern Arabian depending on which dispersal route out of Africa was followed. In this study, we compare Neanderthal introgression in contemporary Levantine and southern Arabian populations to investigate Neanderthal introgression and to study Near Eastern population history.Materials and MethodsWe analyzed genotyping data on &amp;gt;400,000 autosomal SNPs from seven Levantine and five southern Arabian populations and compared those data to populations from around the world including Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes. We used f4 and D statistics to estimate and compare levels of Neanderthal introgression between Levantine, southern Arabian, and comparative global populations. We also identified 1,581 putative Neanderthal-introgressed SNPs within our dataset and analyzed their allele frequencies as a means to compare introgression patterns in Levantine and southern Arabian genomes.ResultsWe find that Levantine and southern Arabian populations have similar levels of Neanderthal introgression to each other but lower levels than other non-Africans. Furthermore, we find that introgressed SNPs have very similar allele frequencies in the Levant and southern Arabia, which indicates that Neanderthal introgression is similarly distributed in Levantine and southern Arabian genomes.DiscussionWe infer that the ancestors of contemporary Levantine and southern Arabian populations received Neanderthal introgression prior to separating from each other and that there has been extensive gene flow between these populations.</p>
