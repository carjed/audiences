          <p>AbstractMotivationGenome-wide profiles of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in diverse cellular contexts are critical to decipher the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to learn predictive cis-regulatory DNA sequence models of context-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across cell types.ResultsWe introduce multi-modal, residual neural network architectures that integrate cis-regulatory sequence and context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular contexts. We show that the average accessibility of a genomic region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies for training models to enhance genome-wide prediction of shared and context-specific chromatin accessible sites across cell types. We interpret the models to reveal insights into cis and trans regulation of chromatin dynamics across 123 diverse cellular contexts.AvailabilityThe code is available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comkundajelabChromDragoNN&gt;httpsgithub.comkundajelabChromDragoNN&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Contactakundaje@stanford.edu</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Targeted Nanopore Sequencing with Cas9 for studies of methylation, structural variants, and mutations, bioRxiv, 2019-04-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractNanopore sequencing technology can rapidly and directly interrogate native DNA molecules. Often we are interested only in interrogating specific areas at high depth, but conventional enrichment methods have thus far proved unsuitable for long reads1. Existing strategies are currently limited by high input DNA requirements, low yield, short (&amp;lt;5kb) reads, time-intensive protocols, andor amplification or cloning (losing base modification information). In this paper, we describe a technique utilizing the ability of Cas9 to introduce cuts at specific locations and ligating nanopore sequencing adaptors directly to those sites, a method we term ‘nanopore Cas9 Targeted-Sequencing’ (nCATS).We have demonstrated this using an Oxford Nanopore MinION flow cell (Capacity &amp;gt;10Gb&#43;) to generate a median 165X coverage at 10 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb, representing a several hundred-fold improvement over the 2-3X coverage achieved without enrichment. We performed a pilot run on the smaller Flongle flow cell (Capacity ~1Gb), generating a median coverage of 30X at 11 genomic loci with a median length of 18kb. Using panels of guide RNAs, we show that the high coverage data from this method enables us to (1) profile DNA methylation patterns at cancer driver genes, (2) detect structural variations at known hot spots, and (3) survey for the presence of single nucleotide mutations. Together, this provides a low-cost method that can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular DNA. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate applications of this technique by examining the well-characterized GM12878 cell line as well as three breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) with varying tumorigenic potential as a model for cancer.ContributionsTG and WT constructed the study. TG performed the experiments. TG, IL, and FS analyzed the data. TG, JG, ER, RB and AH and developed the method. TG and WT wrote the paper</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Comparing within- and between-family polygenic score prediction, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractPolygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight life outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modelling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide novel insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring and Mitigating PCR Bias in Microbiome Data, bioRxiv, 2019-04-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractPCR amplification plays a central role in the measurement of mixed microbial communities via high-throughput sequencing. Yet PCR is also known to be a common source of bias in microbiome data. Here we present a paired modeling and experimental approach to characterize and mitigate PCR bias in microbiome studies. We use experimental data from mock bacterial communities to validate our approach and human gut microbiota samples to characterize PCR bias under real-world conditions. Our results suggest that PCR can bias estimates of microbial relative abundances by a factor of 2-4 but that this bias can be mitigated using simple Bayesian multinomial logistic-normal linear models.Author summaryHigh-throughput sequencing is often used to profile host-associated microbial communities. Many processing steps are required to transform a community of bacteria into a pool of DNA suitable for sequencing. One important step is amplification where, to create enough DNA for sequencing, DNA from many different bacteria are repeatedly copied using a technique called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, PCR is known to introduce bias as DNA from some bacteria are more efficiently copied than others. Here we introduce an experimental procedure that allows this bias to be measured and computational techniques that allow this bias to be mitigated in sequencing data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Basal Contamination of Bulk Sequencing Lessons from the GTEx dataset, bioRxiv, 2019-04-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundOne of the challenges of next generation sequencing (NGS) is contaminating reads from other samples. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a large, diverse, and robustly generated dataset, as a useful resource to understand the factors that contribute to contamination.ResultsWe obtained 11,340 RNA-Seq samples, DNA variant call files (VCF) of 635 individuals, and technical metadata from GTEx as well as read count data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and a pharmacogenetics study. We analyzed 48 tissues in GTEx. Of these, 24 had variant co-expression clusters of four known highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and CELA3A). Fifteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues were also indicative of contamination (KRT4, KRT13, PGC, CPA1, GP2, PRL, LIPF, CTRB2, FGA, HP, CKM, FGG, MYBPC1, MYH2, ZG16B). Sample contamination by non-native genes was highly associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively has high levels of those genes. This was highly significant for both pancreas genes (p= 2.7E-75) and esophagus genes (p= 8.9E-154). We used genetic polymorphism differences between individuals as validation of the contamination. Specifically, 11 SNPs in five genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes. Low-level contamination affected 1,841 (15.8%) samples (defined as ≥500 PRSS1 read counts). It also led to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 19 genes. In support of this type of contamination occurring widely, pancreas gene contamination (PRSS1) was also observed in the HPA dataset, where pancreas samples were sequenced, but not in the pharmacogenomics dataset, where they were not.ConclusionsHighly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate the GTEx dataset impacting on some downstream GTEx data analyses. This type of contamination is not unique to GTEx, being shared with other datasets. Awareness of this process will reduce assigning variable, contaminating low-level gene expression to disease processes.</p>

Nine SNPs in four genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes, validating the contamination. Low-level contamination affected 4,497 (39.6%) samples (defined as 10 PRSS1 TPM). It also led ≥ to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes.

In conclusion, highly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate GTEx and other datasets impacting analyses.
