          <p>Using mRNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly, we identified, cloned and characterized nine previously undiscovered fluorescent protein (FP) homologs from Aequorea victoria and a related Aequorea species, with most sequences highly divergent from avGFP. Among these FPs are the brightest GFP homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, Aequorea species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including two that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that Aequorea CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that Aequorea will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A rationally designed and highly versatile epitope tag for nanobody-based purification, detection and manipulation of proteins, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecialized epitope tags are widely used for detecting, manipulating or purifying proteins, but often their versatility is limited. Here, we introduce the ALFA-tag, a novel, rationally designed epitope tag that serves an exceptionally broad spectrum of applications in life sciences while outperforming established tags like the HA, FLAG or myc tags. The ALFA-tag forms a small and stable α-helix that is functional irrespective of its position on the target protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. We developed a nanobody (NbALFA) binding ALFA-tagged proteins from native or fixed specimen with low picomolar affinity. It is ideally suited for super-resolution microscopy, immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, and also allows in-vivo detection of proteins. By solving the crystal structure of the complex we were able to design a nanobody mutant (NbALFAPE) that permits efficient one-step purifications of native ALFA-tagged proteins, complexes and even entire living cells using peptide elution under physiological conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rotary substates of mitochondrial ATP synthase reveal the basis of flexible F1-Fo coupling, bioRxiv, 2019-02-07</h4>
          <p>F1Fo-ATP synthases play a central role in cellular metabolism, making the energy of the proton-motive force across a membrane available for a large number of energy-consuming processes. We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 Å resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30° of each 120° primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ringa-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases. We identify the previously unknown ASA10 subunit and present complete de novo atomic models of subunits ASA1-10, which make up the two interlinked peripheral stalks that stabilize the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Structure of a bacterial ATP synthase, bioRxiv, 2018-11-06</h4>
          <p>ATP synthases produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate with energy from a transmembrane proton motive force. Bacterial ATP synthases have been studied extensively because they are the simplest form of the enzyme and because of the relative ease of genetic manipulation of these complexes. We expressed the Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase in Eschericia coli, purified it, and imaged it by cryo-EM, allowing us to build atomic models of the complex in three rotational states. The position of subunit e shows how it is able to inhibit ATP hydrolysis while allowing ATP synthesis. The architecture of the membrane region shows how the simple bacterial ATP synthase is able to perform the same core functions as the equivalent, but more complicated, mitochondrial complex. The structures reveal the path of transmembrane proton translocation and provide a model for understanding decades of biochemical analysis interrogating the roles of specific residues in the enzyme.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Structure of transcribing RNA polymerase II-nucleosome complex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-07</h4>
          <p>Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes requires passage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through chromatin. Pol II passage is impaired by nucleosomes and requires elongation factors that help Pol II to efficiently overcome the nucleosomal barrier1-4. How the Pol II machinery transcribes through a nucleosome remains unclear because structural studies have been limited to Pol II elongation complexes formed on DNA templates lacking nucleosomes5. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of transcribing Pol II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae engaged with a downstream nucleosome core particle (NCP) at an overall resolution of 4.4 Å with resolutions ranging from 4-6 Å in Pol II and 6-8 Å in the NCP. Pol II and the NCP adopt a defined orientation that could not be predicted from modelling. Pol II contacts DNA of the incoming NCP on both sides of the nucleosomal dyad with its domains ‘clamp head’ and ‘lobe’. Comparison of the Pol II-NCP structure to known structures of Pol II complexes reveals that the elongation factors TFIIS, DSIF, NELF, PAF1 complex, and SPT6 can be accommodated on the Pol II surface in the presence of the oriented nucleosome. Further structural comparisons show that the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1, which is also required for efficient Pol II passage6,7, could bind the oriented nucleosome with its motor domain. The DNA-binding region of Chd1 must however be released from DNA when Pol II approaches the nucleosome, and based on published data8,9 this is predicted to stimulate Chd1 activity and to facilitate Pol II passage. Our results provide a starting point for a mechanistic analysis of chromatin transcription.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Active and repressed chromatin domains exhibit distinct nucleosome segregation during DNA replication, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryChromatin domains and their associated structures must be faithfully inherited through cellular division to maintain cellular identity. Yet, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) during DNA replication is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at single desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells such that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through the local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment in the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity.</p>
