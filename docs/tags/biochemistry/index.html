          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Primordial emergence of a nucleic acid binding protein via phase separation and statistical ornithine to arginine conversion, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractDe novo emergence, and emergence of the earliest proteins specifically, demands a transition from disordered polypeptides into structured proteins with well-defined functions. However, can peptides confer evolutionary relevant functions, let alone with minimal abiotic amino acid alphabets? How can such polypeptides evolve into mature proteins? Specifically, while nucleic acids binding is presumed a primordial function, it demands basic amino acids that do not readily form abiotically. To address these questions, we describe an experimentally-validated trajectory from a phase-separating polypeptide to a dsDNA-binding protein. The intermediates comprise sequence-duplicated, functional proteins made of only 10 amino acid types, with ornithine, which can form abiotically, as the only basic amino acid. Statistical, chemical modification of ornithine sidechains to arginine promoted structure and function. The function concomitantly evolved – from phase separation with RNA (coacervates) to avid and specific dsDNA binding – thereby demonstrating a smooth, gradual peptide-to-protein transition with respect to sequence, structure, and function.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Skd3 (human CLPB) is a potent mitochondrial protein disaggregase that is inactivated by 3-methylglutaconic aciduria-linked mutations, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTCells have evolved specialized protein disaggregases to reverse toxic protein aggregation and restore protein functionality. In nonmetazoan eukaryotes, the AAA&#43; disaggregase Hsp78 resolubilizes and reactivates proteins in mitochondria. Curiously, metazoa lack Hsp78. Hence, whether metazoan mitochondria reactivate aggregated proteins is unknown. Here, we establish that a mitochondrial AAA&#43; protein, Skd3 (human CLPB), couples ATP hydrolysis to protein disaggregation and reactivation. The Skd3 ankyrin-repeat domain combines with conserved AAA&#43; elements to enable stand-alone disaggregase activity. A mitochondrial inner-membrane protease, PARL, removes an autoinhibitory peptide from Skd3 to greatly enhance disaggregase activity. Indeed, PARL-activated Skd3 dissolves α-synuclein fibrils connected to Parkinson’s disease. Human cells lacking Skd3 exhibit reduced solubility of various mitochondrial proteins, including anti-apoptotic Hax1. Importantly, Skd3 variants linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a severe mitochondrial disorder, display diminished disaggregase activity (but not always reduced ATPase activity), which predicts disease severity. Thus, Skd3 is a potent protein disaggregase critical for human health.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of IRES versus Cap translation with single-molecule resolution in living cells, bioRxiv, 2020-01-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTViruses use IRES sequences within their RNA to hijack translation machinery and thereby rapidly replicate in host cells. While this process has been extensively studied in bulk assays, the dynamics of hijacking at the single-molecule level remain unexplored in living cells. To achieve this, we developed a bicistronic biosensor encoding complementary repeat epitopes in two ORFs, one translated in a Cap-dependent manner and the other translated in an IRES-mediated manner. Using a pair of complementary probes that bind the epitopes co-translationally, our biosensor lights up in different colors depending on which ORF is being translated. In combination with single-molecule tracking and computational modeling, we measured the relative kinetics of Cap versus IRES translation and show (1) Two non-overlapping ORFs can be simultaneously translated within a single mRNA; (2) EMCV IRES-mediated translation sites recruit ribosomes less efficiently than Cap-dependent translation sites but are otherwise nearly indistinguishable, having similar mobilities, sizes, spatial distributions, and ribosomal initiation and elongation rates; (3) Both Cap-dependent and IRES-mediated ribosomes tend to stretch out translation sites; (4) Although the IRES recruits two to three times fewer ribosomes than the Cap in normal conditions, the balance shifts dramatically in favor of the IRES during oxidative and ER stresses that mimic viral infection; and (5) Translation of the IRES is enhanced by translation of the Cap, demonstrating upstream translation can positively impact the downstream translation of a non-overlapping ORF. With the ability to simultaneously quantify two distinct translation mechanisms in physiologically relevant live-cell environments, we anticipate bicistronic biosensors like the one we developed here will become powerful new tools to dissect both canonical and non-canonical translation dynamics with single-molecule precision.Graphical Abstract&lt;jatsfig id=ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait fig-type=figure&gt;&lt;jatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=900829v1_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait &gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Aequorea victoria’s secrets, bioRxiv, 2019-06-20</h4>
          <p>Using mRNA-Seq and de novo transcriptome assembly, we identified, cloned and characterized nine previously undiscovered fluorescent protein (FP) homologs from Aequorea victoria and a related Aequorea species, with most sequences highly divergent from avGFP. Among these FPs are the brightest GFP homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, Aequorea species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including two that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that Aequorea CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that Aequorea will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A rationally designed and highly versatile epitope tag for nanobody-based purification, detection and manipulation of proteins, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpecialized epitope tags are widely used for detecting, manipulating or purifying proteins, but often their versatility is limited. Here, we introduce the ALFA-tag, a novel, rationally designed epitope tag that serves an exceptionally broad spectrum of applications in life sciences while outperforming established tags like the HA, FLAG or myc tags. The ALFA-tag forms a small and stable α-helix that is functional irrespective of its position on the target protein in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. We developed a nanobody (NbALFA) binding ALFA-tagged proteins from native or fixed specimen with low picomolar affinity. It is ideally suited for super-resolution microscopy, immunoprecipitations and Western blotting, and also allows in-vivo detection of proteins. By solving the crystal structure of the complex we were able to design a nanobody mutant (NbALFAPE) that permits efficient one-step purifications of native ALFA-tagged proteins, complexes and even entire living cells using peptide elution under physiological conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rotary substates of mitochondrial ATP synthase reveal the basis of flexible F1-Fo coupling, bioRxiv, 2019-02-07</h4>
          <p>F1Fo-ATP synthases play a central role in cellular metabolism, making the energy of the proton-motive force across a membrane available for a large number of energy-consuming processes. We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 Å resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30° of each 120° primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ringa-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases. We identify the previously unknown ASA10 subunit and present complete de novo atomic models of subunits ASA1-10, which make up the two interlinked peripheral stalks that stabilize the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer.</p>
