          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome-wide signals of drift and local adaptation during rapid lineage divergence in a songbird, bioRxiv, 2018-01-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe formation of independent evolutionary lineages involves neutral and selective factors, and understanding their relative roles in population divergence is a fundamental goal of speciation research. Correlations between allele frequencies and environmental variability can reveal the role of selection, yet the relative contribution of drift can be difficult to establish. Recently diversified systems such as that of the Oregon junco (Aves Emberizidae) of western North America provide ideal scenarios to apply genetic-environment association analyses (GEA) while controlling for population structure. Genome-wide SNP loci analyses revealed marked genetic structure consisting of differentiated populations in isolated, dry southern mountain ranges, and more admixed recently expanded populations in humid northern latitudes. We used correlations between genomic and environmental variance to test for three specific modes of evolutionary divergence (i) drift in geographic isolation, (ii) differentiation along continuous selective gradients, and (iii) isolation by adaptation. We found evidence of strong drift in southern mountains, but also signals of local adaptation in several populations, driven by temperature, precipitation, elevation and vegetation, especially when controlling for population history. We identified numerous variants under selection scattered across the genome, suggesting that local adaptation can promote rapid differentiation over short periods when acting over multiple independent loci.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inferring Species Trees Using Integrative Models of Species Evolution, bioRxiv, 2018-01-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractBayesian methods can be used to accurately estimate species tree topologies, times and other parameters, but only when the models of evolution which are available and utilized sufficiently account for the underlying evolutionary processes. Multispecies coalescent (MSC) models have been shown to accurately account for the evolution of genes within species in the absence of strong gene flow between lineages, and fossilized birth-death (FBD) models have been shown to estimate divergence times from fossil data in good agreement with expert opinion. Until now dating analyses using the MSC have been based on a fixed clock or informally derived node priors instead of the FBD. On the other hand, dating analyses using an FBD process have concatenated all gene sequences and ignored coalescence processes. To address these mirror-image deficiencies in evolutionary models, we have developed an integrative model of evolution which combines both the FBD and MSC models. By applying concatenation and the MSC (without employing the FBD process) to an exemplar data set consisting of molecular sequence data and morphological characters from the dog and fox subfamily Caninae, we show that concatenation causes predictable biases in estimated branch lengths. We then applied concatenation using the FBD process and the combined FBD-MSC model to show that the same biases are still observed when the FBD process is employed. These biases can be avoided by using the FBD-MSC model, which coherently models fossilization and gene evolution, and does not require an a priori substitution rate estimate to calibrate the molecular clock. We have implemented the FBD-MSC in a new version of StarBEAST2, a package developed for the BEAST2 phylogenetic software.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">NanoAmpli-Seq A workflow for amplicon sequencing for mixed microbial communities on the nanopore sequencing platform, bioRxiv, 2018-01-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundAmplicon sequencing on Illumina sequencing platforms leverages their deep sequencing and multiplexing capacity, but is limited in genetic resolution due to short read lengths. While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or smaller data output.ResultsIn this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on Intramolecular-ligated Nanopore Consensus Sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the aforementioned protocol that reduces sample-processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences.ConclusionsNanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average sequence accuracy of 99.5% for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware basecalling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Prokaryotic nanocompartments form synthetic organelles in a eukaryote, bioRxiv, 2018-01-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractCompartmentalization of proteins into organelles is a promising strategy for enhancing the productivity of engineered eukaryotic organisms. However, approaches that co-opt endogenous organelles may be limited by the potential for unwanted crosstalk and disruption of native metabolic functions. Here, we present the construction of synthetic non-endogenous organelles in the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on the prokaryotic family of self-assembling proteins known as encapsulins. We establish that encapsulins self-assemble to form nanoscale compartments in yeast, and that heterologous proteins can be selectively targeted for compartmentalization. Housing destabilized proteins within encapsulin compartments affords protection against proteolytic degradation in vivo, while the interaction between split protein components is enhanced upon co-localization within the compartment interior. Furthermore, encapsulin compartments can support enzymatic catalysis, with substrate turnover observed for an encapsulated yeast enzyme. Encapsulin compartments therefore represent a modular platform, orthogonal to existing organelles, for programming synthetic compartmentalization in eukaryotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Graph theory approaches to functional network organization in brain disorders A critique for a brave new small-world, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractOver the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods have provided new insights into the network organization of the human brain. Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Identification of Pre-Existing Adaptive Immunity to Cas9 Proteins in Humans, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe CRISPR-Cas9 system has proven to be a powerful tool for genome editing, allowing for the precise modification of specific DNA sequences within a cell. Many efforts are currently underway to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the therapeutic correction of human genetic diseases. The most widely used homologs of the Cas9 protein are derived from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Based on the fact that these two bacterial species cause infections in the human population at high frequencies, we looked for the presence of pre-existing adaptive immune responses to their respective Cas9 homologs, SaCas9 (S. aureus homolog of Cas9) and SpCas9 (S. pyogenes homolog of Cas9). To determine the presence of anti-Cas9 antibodies, we probed for the two homologs using human serum and were able to detect antibodies against both, with 79% of donors staining against SaCas9 and 65% of donors staining against SpCas9. Upon investigating the presence of antigen-specific T-cells against the two homologs in human peripheral blood, we found anti-SaCas9 T-cells in 46% of donors. Upon isolating, expanding, and conducting antigen re-stimulation experiments on several of these donors’ anti-SaCas9 T-cells, we observed an SaCas9-specific response confirming that these T-cells were antigen-specific. We were unable to detect antigen-specific T-cells against SpCas9, although the sensitivity of the assay precludes us from concluding that such T-cells do not exist. Together, this data demonstrates that there are pre-existing humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses to Cas9 in humans, a factor which must be taken into account as the CRISPR-Cas9 system moves forward into clinical trials.</p>
