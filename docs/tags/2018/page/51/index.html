          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Author-Reviewer Homophily in Peer Review, bioRxiv, 2018-08-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe fairness of scholarly peer review has been challenged by evidence of disparities in publication outcomes based on author demographic characteristics. To assess this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications. Code and anonymized data have been made available at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.commurraydselife-analysis&gt;httpsgithub.commurraydselife-analysis&lt;jatsext-link&gt;Author summaryPeer review, the primary method by which scientific work is evaluated, is ideally a fair and equitable process in which scientific work is judged solely on its own merit. However, the integrity of peer review has been called into question based on evidence that outcomes often differ between male and female authors, and for authors in different countries. We investigated such disparities at the biosciences journal eLife by analyzing the demographics of authors and gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers), and peer review outcomes of all submissions between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were more favorable for male authors and those affiliated with institutions in North America and Europe; these groups were also over-represented among gatekeepers. There was evidence that peer review outcomes were influenced by homophily â€”a preference of gatekeepers for manuscripts from authors with shared characteristics. We discuss mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications.</p>

          <p>AbstractSingle-cell transcriptome analysis of heterogeneous tissues can provide high-resolution windows into the genomic basis and spatiotemporal dynamics of developmental processes. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing of plant tissue using the Drop-seq approach. Profiling of &amp;gt;4,000 individual cells from the Arabidopsis root provides transcriptomes and marker genes for a diversity of cell types and illuminates the gene expression changes that occur across endodermis development.</p>

          <p>Introductory ParagraphSurveillance of circulating drug resistant bacteria is essential for healthcare providers to deliver effective empiric antibiotic therapy. However, the results of surveillance may not be available on a timescale that is optimal for guiding patient treatment. Here we present a method for inferring characteristics of an unknown bacterial sample by identifying the presence of sequence variation across the genome that is linked to a phenotype of interest, in this case drug resistance. We demonstrate an implementation of this principle using sequence k-mer content, matched to a database of known genomes. We show this technique can be applied to data from an Oxford Nanopore device in real time and is capable of identifying the presence of a known resistant strain in 5 minutes, even from a complex metagenomic sample. This flexible approach has wide application to pathogen surveillance and may be used to greatly accelerate diagnoses of resistant infections.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapid heuristic inference of antibiotic resistance and susceptibility by genomic neighbor typing, bioRxiv, 2018-08-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractSurveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is essential for healthcare providers to deliver effective empiric antibiotic therapy. However, traditional molecular epidemiology does not typically occur on a timescale that could impact patient treatment and outcomes. Here we present a method called â€˜genomic neighbor typingâ€™ for inferring the phenotype of a bacterial sample by identifying its closest relatives in a database of genomes with metadata. We show that this technique can infer antibiotic susceptibility and resistance for both S. pneumoniae and N. gonorrhoeae. We implemented this with rapid k-mer matching, which, when used on Oxford Nanopore MinION data, can run in real time. This resulted in determination of resistance within ten minutes (sensspec 91%100% for S. pneumoniae and 81%100% N. gonorrhoeae from isolates with a representative database) of sequencing starting, and for clinical metagenomic sputum samples (75%100% for S. pneumoniae), within four hours of sample collection. This flexible approach has wide application to pathogen surveillance and may be used to greatly accelerate appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">SABER enables highly multiplexed and amplified detection of DNA and RNA in cells and tissues, bioRxiv, 2018-08-28</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) reveals the abun-dance and positioning of nucleic acid sequences in fixed sam-ples and can be combined with cell segmentation to produce a powerful single cell gene expression assay. However, it re-mains difficult to label more than a few targets and to visu-alize nucleic acids in environments such as thick tissue sam-ples using conventional FISH technologies. Recently, meth-ods have been developed for multiplexed amplification of FISH signals, yet it remains challenging to achieve high lev-els of simultaneous multiplexing combined with high sam-pling efficiency and simple workflows. Here, we introduce signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER), which endows oligo-based FISH probes with long, single-stranded DNA concatemers that serve as targets for sensitive fluores-cent detection. We establish that SABER effectively ampli-fies the signal of probes targeting nucleic acids in fixed cells and tissues, can be deployed against at least 17 targets si-multaneously, and detects mRNAs with high efficiency. As a demonstration of the utility of SABER in assays involv-ing genetic manipulations, we apply multiplexed FISH of reporters and cell type markers to the identification of en-hancers with cell type-specific activity in the mouse retina. SABER represents a simple and versatile molecular toolkit to allow rapid and cost effective multiplexed imaging.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The deadly touch protein denaturation at the water-air interface and how to prevent it, bioRxiv, 2018-08-26</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTElectron cryo-microscopy analyzes the structure of proteins and protein complexes in vitrified solution. Proteins tend to adsorb to the air-water interface in unsupported films of aqueous solution, which can result in partial or complete denaturation of the protein. We investigated the structure of yeast fatty acid synthase at the air-water interface by electron cryo-tomography and single-particle image processing. Around 90% of complexes adsorbed to the air-water interface are partly denatured. We show that the unfolded regions are those facing the air-water interface. Denaturation by contact with air may happen at any stage of specimen preparation. Denaturation at the air-water interface is completely avoided when the complex is plunge-frozen on a substrate of hydrophilized graphene.</p>
