          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A systematic review of Drosophila short-term-memory genetics meta-analysis reveals robust reproducibility, bioRxiv, 2018-01-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractGeneticists use olfactory conditioning in Drosophila to identify learning genes; however, little is known about how these genes are integrated into short-term memory (STM) pathways. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the STM evidence base is weak. We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of the field. Using metrics to quantify variation between discovery articles and follow-up studies, we found that seven genes were both highly replicated, and highly reproducible. However, ~80% of STM genes have never been replicated. While only a few studies investigated interactions, the reviewed genes could account for &amp;gt;1000% memory. This large summed effect size could indicate irreproducibility, many shared pathways, or that current assay protocols lack the specificity needed to identify core plasticity genes. Mechanistic theories of memory will require the convergence of evidence from system, circuit, cellular, molecular, and genetic experiments; systematic data synthesis is an essential tool for integrated neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fast automated reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic models for microbial species and communities, bioRxiv, 2018-01-13</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenome-scale metabolic models are instrumental in uncovering operating principles of cellular metabolism and model-guided re-engineering. Recent applications of metabolic models have also demonstrated their usefulness in unraveling cross-feeding within microbial communities. Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging far behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual cura-tion required to obtain good quality models and thus physiologically meaningful simulation results. Here, we present an automated tool – CarveMe – for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation-ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We build reconstructions for two model organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtillis, as well as a collection of human gut bacteria, and show that CarveMe models perform similarly to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of CarveMe through reconstructing 5587 bacterial models. Overall, CarveMe provides an open-source and user-friendly tool towards broadening the use of metabolic modeling in studying microbial species and communities.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct imaging of the circular chromosome in a live bacterium, bioRxiv, 2018-01-12</h4>
          <p>New assays for quantitative imaging1–6 and sequencing7–11 have yielded great progress towards understanding the organizational principles of chromosomes. Yet, even for the well-studied model bacterium Escherichia coli, many basic questions remain unresolved regarding chromosomal (sub-)structure2,11, its mechanics1,2,12 and dynamics13,14, and the link between structure and function1,15,16. Here we resolve the spatial organization of the circular chromosome of bacteria by directly imaging the chromosome in live E. coli cells with a broadened cell shape. The chromosome was observed to exhibit a torus topology with a 4.2 μm toroidal length and 0.4 μm bundle thickness. On average, the DNA density along the chromosome shows dense right and left arms that branch from a lower-density origin of replication, and are connected at the terminus of replication by an ultrathin flexible string of DNA. At the single-cell level, the DNA density along the torus is found to be strikingly heterogeneous, with blob-like Mbp-size domains that undergo major dynamic rearrangements, splitting and merging at a minute timescale. We show that prominent domain boundaries at the terminus and origin of replication are induced by MatP proteins, while weaker transient domain boundaries are facilitated by the global transcription regulators HU and Fis. These findings provide an architectural basis for the understanding of the spatial organization of bacterial genomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High accuracy haplotype-derived allele frequencies from ultra-low coverage pool-seq samples, bioRxiv, 2018-01-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractEvolve-and-resequence experiments leverage next-generation sequencing technology to track allele frequency dynamics of populations as they evolve. While previous work has shown that adaptive alleles can be detected by comparing frequency trajectories from many replicate populations, this power comes at the expense of high-coverage (&amp;gt;100x) sequencing of many pooled samples, which can be cost-prohibitive. Here we show that accurate estimates of allele frequencies can be achieved with very shallow sequencing depths (&amp;lt;5x) via inference of known founder haplotypes in small genomic windows. This technique can be used to efficiently estimate frequencies for any number of alleles in any model system. Using both experimentally-pooled and simulated samples of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that haplotype inference can improve allele frequency accuracy by orders of magnitude, and that high accuracy is maintained after up to 200 generations of recombination, even in the presence of missing data or incomplete founder knowledge. By reducing sequencing costs without sacrificing accuracy, our method enables analysis of samples from more time-points and replicates, increasing the statistical power to detect adaptive alleles.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Limitation of alignment-free tools in total RNA-seq quantification, bioRxiv, 2018-01-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundAlignment-free RNA quantification tools have significantly increased the speed of RNA-seq analysis. However, it is unclear whether these state-of-the-art RNA-seq analysis pipelines can quantify small RNAs as accurately as they do with long RNAs in the context of total RNA quantification.ResultWe comprehensively tested and compared four RNA-seq pipelines on the accuracies of gene quantification and fold-change estimation on a novel total RNA benchmarking dataset, in which small non-coding RNAs are highly represented along with other long RNAs. The four RNA-seq pipelines were of two commonly-used alignment-free pipelines and two variants of alignment-based pipelines. We found that all pipelines showed high accuracies for quantifying the expressions of long and highly-abundant genes. However, alignment-free pipelines showed systematically poorer performances in quantifying lowly-abundant and small RNAs.ConclusionWe have shown that alignment-free and traditional alignment-based quantification methods performed similarly for common gene targets, such as protein-coding genes. However, we identified a potential pitfall in analyzing and quantifying lowly-expressed genes and small RNAs with alignment-free pipelines, especially when these small RNAs contain mutations.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTWe recently developed novel AAV capsids for efficient and noninvasive gene transfer across the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this protocol, we describe how to produce and systemically administer AAV-PHP viruses to label andor genetically manipulate cells in the mouse nervous system and organs including the heart. The procedure comprises three separate stages AAV production, intravenous delivery, and evaluation of transgene expression. The protocol spans eight days, excluding the time required to assess gene expression, and can be readily adopted by laboratories with standard molecular and cell culture capabilities. We provide guidelines for experimental design and choosing the capsid, cargo, and viral dose appropriate for the experimental aims. The procedures outlined here are adaptable to diverse biomedical applications, from anatomical and functional mapping to gene expression, silencing, and editing.</p>
