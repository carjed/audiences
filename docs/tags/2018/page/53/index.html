          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale whole-genome sequencing of three diverse Asian populations in Singapore, bioRxiv, 2018-08-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractAsian populations are currently underrepresented in human genetics research. Here we present whole-genome sequencing data of 4,810 Singaporeans from three diverse ethnic groups 2,780 Chinese, 903 Malays, and 1,127 Indians. Despite a medium depth of 13.7×, we achieved essentially perfect (&amp;gt;99.8%) sensitivity and accuracy for detecting common variants and good sensitivity (&amp;gt;89%) for detecting extremely rare variants with &amp;lt;0.1% allele frequency. We found 89.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 9.1 million small insertions and deletions (INDELs), more than half of which have not been cataloged in dbSNP. In particular, we found 126 common deleterious mutations (MAF&amp;gt;0.01) that were absent in the existing public databases, highlighting the importance of local population reference for genetic diagnosis. We describe fine-scale genetic structure of Singapore populations and their relationship to worldwide populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. In addition to revealing noticeable amounts of admixture among three Singapore populations and a Malay-related novel ancestry component that has not been captured by the 1000 Genomes Project, our analysis also identified some fine-scale features of genetic structure consistent with two waves of prehistoric migration from south China to Southeast Asia. Finally, we demonstrate that our data can substantially improve genotype imputation not only for Singapore populations, but also for populations across Asia and Oceania. These results highlight the genetic diversity in Singapore and the potential impacts of our data as a resource to empower human genetics discovery in a broad geographic region.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modified penetrance of coding variants by cis-regulatory variation contributes to disease risk, Nature Genetics, 2018-08-10</h4>
          <p>Coding variants represent many of the strongest associations between genotype and phenotype; however, they exhibit inter-individual differences in effect, termed ‘variable penetrance’. Here, we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants. Using functional genomic and genetic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), we observed that in the general population, purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations predicted to increase pathogenic coding variant penetrance. Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPRCas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout. Our results demonstrate that joint regulatory and coding variant effects are an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits and contribute to modified penetrance of disease-causing variants.</p>

          <p>An underlying question for virtually all single-cell RNA sequencing experiments is how to allocate the limited sequencing budget deep sequencing of a few cells or shallow sequencing of many cells? A mathematical framework reveals that, for estimating many important gene properties, the optimal allocation is to sequence at the depth of one read per cell per gene. Interestingly, the corresponding optimal estimator is not the widely-used plugin estimator but one developed via empirical Bayes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Expanding Parkinson’s disease genetics novel risk loci, genomic context, causal insights and heritable risk, bioRxiv, 2018-08-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe performed the largest genome-wide association study of PD to date, involving the analysis of 7.8M SNPs in 37.7K cases, 18.6K UK Biobank proxy-cases, and 1.4M controls. We identified 90 independent genome-wide significant signals across 78 loci, including 38 independent risk signals in 37 novel loci. These variants explained 26-36% of the heritable risk of PD. Tests of causality within a Mendelian randomization framework identified putatively causal genes for 70 risk signals. Tissue expression enrichment analysis suggested that signatures of PD loci were heavily brain-enriched, consistent with specific neuronal cell types being implicated from single cell expression data. We found significant genetic correlations with brain volumes, smoking status, and educational attainment. In sum, these data provide the most comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture of PD to date by revealing many additional PD risk loci, providing a biological context for these risk factors, and demonstrating that a considerable genetic component of this disease remains unidentified.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapid Diagnosis of Lower Respiratory Infection using Nanopore-based Clinical Metagenomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractLower respiratory infections (LRIs) accounted for three million deaths worldwide in 2016, the leading infectious cause of mortality. The “gold standard” for investigation of bacterial LRIs is culture, which has poor sensitivity and is too slow to guide early antibiotic therapy. Metagenomic sequencing potentially could replace culture, providing rapid, sensitive and comprehensive results. We developed a metagenomics pipeline for the investigation of bacterial LRIs using saponin-based host DNA depletion combined with rapid nanopore sequencing. The first iteration of the pipeline was tested on respiratory samples from 40 patients. It was then refined to reduce turnaround and increase sensitivity, before testing a further 41 samples. The refined method was 96.6% concordant with culture for detection of pathogens and could accurately detect resistance genes with a turnaround time of six hours. This study demonstrates that nanopore metagenomics can rapidly and accurately characterise bacterial LRIs when combined with efficient human DNA depletion.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exploring the effect of microdosing psychedelics on creativity in an open-label natural setting, bioRxiv, 2018-08-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractIntroductionRecently popular sub-perceptual doses of psychedelic substances such as truffles, referred to as microdosing, allegedly have multiple beneficial effects including creativity and problem solving performance, potentially through targeting serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors and promoting cognitive flexibility, crucial to creative thinking. Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults.MethodsDuring a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking, and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were manifested.ResultsWe found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected.ConclusionWhile this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.</p>
