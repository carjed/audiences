          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">NanoAmpli-Seq A workflow for amplicon sequencing for mixed microbial communities on the nanopore sequencing platform, bioRxiv, 2018-01-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundAmplicon sequencing on Illumina sequencing platforms leverages their deep sequencing and multiplexing capacity, but is limited in genetic resolution due to short read lengths. While Oxford Nanopore or Pacific Biosciences platforms overcome this limitation, their application has been limited due to higher error rates or smaller data output.ResultsIn this study, we introduce an amplicon sequencing workflow, i.e., NanoAmpli-Seq, that builds on Intramolecular-ligated Nanopore Consensus Sequencing (INC-Seq) approach and demonstrate its application for full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. NanoAmpli-Seq includes vital improvements to the aforementioned protocol that reduces sample-processing time while significantly improving sequence accuracy. The developed protocol includes chopSeq software for fragmentation and read orientation correction of INC-Seq consensus reads while nanoClust algorithm was designed for read partitioning-based de novo clustering and within cluster consensus calling to obtain full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences.ConclusionsNanoAmpli-Seq accurately estimates the diversity of tested mock communities with average sequence accuracy of 99.5% for 2D and 1D2 sequencing on the nanopore sequencing platform. Nearly all residual errors in NanoAmpli-Seq sequences originate from deletions in homopolymer regions, indicating that homopolymer aware basecalling or error correction may allow for sequencing accuracy comparable to short-read sequencing platforms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Prokaryotic nanocompartments form synthetic organelles in a eukaryote, bioRxiv, 2018-01-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractCompartmentalization of proteins into organelles is a promising strategy for enhancing the productivity of engineered eukaryotic organisms. However, approaches that co-opt endogenous organelles may be limited by the potential for unwanted crosstalk and disruption of native metabolic functions. Here, we present the construction of synthetic non-endogenous organelles in the eukaryotic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, based on the prokaryotic family of self-assembling proteins known as encapsulins. We establish that encapsulins self-assemble to form nanoscale compartments in yeast, and that heterologous proteins can be selectively targeted for compartmentalization. Housing destabilized proteins within encapsulin compartments affords protection against proteolytic degradation in vivo, while the interaction between split protein components is enhanced upon co-localization within the compartment interior. Furthermore, encapsulin compartments can support enzymatic catalysis, with substrate turnover observed for an encapsulated yeast enzyme. Encapsulin compartments therefore represent a modular platform, orthogonal to existing organelles, for programming synthetic compartmentalization in eukaryotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Graph theory approaches to functional network organization in brain disorders A critique for a brave new small-world, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractOver the past two decades, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods have provided new insights into the network organization of the human brain. Studies of brain disorders such as Alzheimerâ€™s disease or depression have adapted tools from graph theory to characterize differences between healthy and patient populations. Here, we conducted a review of clinical network neuroscience, summarizing methodological details from 106 RSFC studies. Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses. Fourth, some studies tested hypotheses at one level of the graph without a clear neurobiological rationale or considering how findings at one level (e.g., global topology) are contextualized by another (e.g., modular structure). Based on these themes, we conducted network simulations to demonstrate the impact of specific methodological decisions on case-control comparisons. Finally, we offer suggestions for promoting convergence across clinical studies in order to facilitate progress in this important field.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Protein-coding variation and introgression of regulatory alleles drive plumage pattern diversity in the rock pigeon, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBirds and other vertebrates display stunning variation in pigmentation patterning, yet the genes controlling this diversity remain largely unknown. Rock pigeons (Columba livia) are fundamentally one of four color pattern phenotypes, in decreasing order of melanism T-check, checker, bar (ancestral), or barless. Using whole-genome scans, we identified NDP as a candidate gene for this variation. Allele-specific expression differences in NDP indicate cis-regulatory differences between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), providing a striking example of introgression of alleles that are favored by breeders and are potentially advantageous in the wild. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like two human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in NDP. In summary, we find unexpected links between color pattern, introgression, and vision defects associated with regulatory and coding variation at a single locus.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome-wide association study of 1 million people identifies 111 loci for atrial fibrillation, bioRxiv, 2018-01-05</h4>
          <p>SummaryTo understand the genetic variation underlying atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of &amp;gt; 1 million people, including 60,620 AF cases and 970,216 controls. We identified 163 independent risk variants at 111 loci and prioritized 165 candidate genes likely to be involved in AF. Many of the identified risk variants fall near genes where more deleterious mutations have been reported to cause serious heart defects in humans or mice (MYH6, NKX2-5, PITX2, TBC1D32, TBX5),1,2 or near genes important for striated muscle function and integrity (e.g. MYH7, PKP2, SSPN, SGCA). Experiments in rabbits with heart failure and left atrial dilation identified a heterogeneous distributed molecular switch from MYH6 to MYH7 in the left atrium, which resulted in contractile and functional heterogeneity and may predispose to initiation and maintenance of atrial arrhythmia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics for Noninvasive Control of Neural Circuits, bioRxiv, 2018-01-02</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTNeurological and psychiatric diseases often involve the dysfunction of specific neural circuits in particular regions of the brain. Existing treatments, including drugs and implantable brain stimulators, aim to modulate the activity of these circuits, but are typically not cell type-specific, lack spatial targeting or require invasive procedures. Here, we introduce an approach to modulating neural circuits noninvasively with spatial, cell-type and temporal specificity. This approach, called acoustically targeted chemogenetics, or ATAC, uses transient ultrasonic opening of the blood brain barrier to transduce neurons at specific locations in the brain with virally-encoded engineered G-protein-coupled receptors, which subsequently respond to systemically administered bio-inert compounds to activate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. We demonstrate this concept in mice by using ATAC to noninvasively modify and subsequently activate or inhibit excitatory neurons within the hippocampus, showing that this enables pharmacological control of memory formation. This technology allows a brief, noninvasive procedure to make one or more specific brain regions capable of being selectively modulated using orally bioavailable compounds, thereby overcoming some of the key limitations of conventional brain therapies.</p>
