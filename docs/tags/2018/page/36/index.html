          <p>ABSTRACTCRISPR-mediated base editors have opened unique avenues for scar-free genome-wide mutagenesis. Here, we describe a comprehensive computational workflow called beditor that can be broadly adapted for designing guide RNA libraries with a range of CRISPR-mediated base editors, PAM recognition sequences and genomes of many species. Additionally, in order to assist users in selecting the best sets of guide RNAs for their experiments, a priori estimates, called beditor scores are calculated. These beditor scores are intended to select guide RNAs that conform to requirements for optimal base editing the editable base falls within maximum activity window of the CRISPR-mediated base editor and produces non-confounding mutational effects with minimal predicted off-target effects. We demonstrate the utility of the software by designing guide RNAs for base-editing to create or remove thousands of clinically important human disease mutations.</p>

          <p>AbstractInternal states, including affective or homeostatic states, are important behavioral motivators. The amygdala is a key brain region involved in the regulation of motivated behaviors, yet how distinct internal states are represented in amygdala circuits is unknown. Here, by imaging somatic neural calcium dynamics in freely moving mice, we identify changes in the relative activity levels of two major, non-overlapping populations of principal neurons in the basal nucleus of the amygdala (BA) that predict switches between exploratory and non-exploratory (defensive, anxiety-like) behavioral states across different environments. Moreover, the amygdala widely broadcasts internal state information via several output pathways to larger brain networks, and sensory responses in BA occur independently of behavioral state encoding. Thus, the brain processes external stimuli and internal states in an orthogonal manner, which may facilitate rapid and flexible selection of appropriate, state-dependent behavioral responses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-throughput targeted long-read single cell sequencing reveals the clonal and transcriptional landscape of lymphocytes, bioRxiv, 2018-09-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractHigh-throughput single-cell RNA-Sequencing is a powerful technique for gene expression profiling of complex and heterogeneous cellular populations such as the immune system. However, these methods only provide short-read sequence from one end of a cDNA template, making them poorly suited to the investigation of gene-regulatory events such as mRNA splicing, adaptive immune responses or somatic genome evolution. To address this challenge, we have developed a method that combines targeted long-read sequencing with short-read based transcriptome profiling of barcoded single cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We use Repertoire And Gene Expression sequencing (RAGE-seq) to accurately characterize full-length T cell (TCR) and B cell (BCR) receptor sequences and transcriptional profiles of more than 7,138 lymphocytes sampled from the primary tumour and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient. With this method we show that somatic mutation, alternate splicing and clonal evolution of T and B lymphocytes can be tracked across these tissue compartments. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is an accessible and cost-effective method for high-throughput deep single cell profiling, applicable to a wide range of biological challenges.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The genetics of university success, Scientific Reports, 2018-09-25</h4>
          <p>University success, which includes enrolment in and achievement at university, as well as quality of the university, have all been linked to later earnings, health and wellbeing. However, little is known about the causes and correlates of differences in university-level outcomes. Capitalizing on both quantitative and molecular genetic data, we perform the first genetically sensitive investigation of university success with a UK-representative sample of 3,000 genotyped individuals and 3,000 twin pairs. Twin analyses indicate substantial additive genetic influence on university entrance exam achievement (57%), university enrolment (51%), university quality (57%) and university achievement (46%). We find that environmental effects tend to be non-shared, although the shared environment is substantial for university enrolment. Furthermore, using multivariate twin analysis, we show moderate to high genetic correlations between university success variables (0.27â€“0.76). Analyses using DNA alone also support genetic influence on university success. Indeed, a genome-wide polygenic score, derived from a 2016 genome-wide association study of years of education, predicts up to 5% of the variance in each university success variable. These findings suggest young adults select and modify their educational experiences in part based on their genetic propensities and highlight the potential for DNA-based predictions of real-world outcomes, which will continue to increase in predictive power.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Trans effects on gene expression can drive omnigenic inheritance, bioRxiv, 2018-09-25</h4>
          <p>Early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, the most significant genetic variants contribute only a small fraction of the estimated heritability. Instead, it has become clear that a huge number of common variants, each with tiny effects, explain most of the heritability. Previously, we argued that these patterns conï¬‚ict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated â€“ as seems likely â€“ then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes. Thus our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A transposable element insertion is the switch between alternative life history strategies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-24</h4>
          <p>Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs in wild populations. Many species of Colias butterflies exhibit an alternative life history strategy (ALHS) where females divert resources from wing pigment synthesis to reproductive and somatic development. Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS individuals have either yelloworange or white wings. Here we map the genetic basis of the ALHS switch in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPRCas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find morph-specific specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. These findings characterize a novel mechanism for a female-limited ALHS and show that the switch arises via recruitment of a transcription factor previously known for its function in cell fate determination in pigment cells of the retina.</p>
