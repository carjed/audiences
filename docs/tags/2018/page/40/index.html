          <p>The infant gut microbiota has a high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) compared to adults, even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Here we study potential sources of infant gut ARGs by performing metagenomic sequencing of breast milk, as well as infant and maternal gut microbiomes. We find that fecal ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles of infants are more similar to those of their own mothers than to those of unrelated mothers. MGEs in mothers’ breast milk are also shared with their own infants. Termination of breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers, which have the potential to affect microbial community composition, are associated with higher abundances of specific ARGs, the composition of which is largely shaped by bacterial phylogeny in the infant gut. Our results suggest that infants inherit the legacy of past antibiotic consumption of their mothers via transmission of genes, but microbiota composition still strongly impacts the overall resistance load.</p>

          <p>High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTBacterial CRISPR systems have been widely adopted to create operator-specified site-specific nucleases. Such nuclease action commonly results in loss-of-function alleles, facilitating functional analysis of genes and gene families We conducted a systematic comparison of components and T-DNA architectures for CRISPR-mediated gene editing in Arabidopsis, testing multiple promoters, terminators, sgRNA backbones and Cas9 alleles. We identified a T-DNA architecture that usually results in stable (i.e. homozygous) mutations in the first generation after transformation. Notably, the transcription of sgRNA and Cas9 in head-to-head divergent orientation usually resulted in highly active lines. Our Arabidopsis data may prove useful for optimization of CRISPR methods in other plants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probing variability in a cognitive map using manifold inference from neural dynamics, bioRxiv, 2018-09-17</h4>
          <p>Hippocampal neurons fire selectively in local behavioral contexts such as the position in an environment or phase of a task,1-3 and are thought to form a cognitive map of task-relevant variables.1,4,5 However, their activity varies over repeated behavioral conditions,6 such as different runs through the same position or repeated trials. Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold—a space of possible network states. The manifold’s structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transformation of Speech Sequences in Human Sensorimotor Circuits, bioRxiv, 2018-09-17</h4>
          <p>SummaryAfter we listen to a series of words, we can silently replay them in our mind. Does this mental replay involve a re-activation of our original perceptual representations? We recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity across the lateral cerebral cortex as people heard and then mentally rehearsed spoken sentences. For each region, we tested whether silent rehearsal of sentences involved reactivation of sentence-specific representations established during perception or transformation to a distinct representation. In sensorimotor and premotor cortex, we observed reliable and temporally precise responses to speech; these patterns transformed to distinct sentence-specific representations during mental rehearsal. In contrast, we observed slower and less reliable responses in prefrontal and temporoparietal cortex; these higher-order representations, which were sensitive to sentence semantics, were shared across perception and rehearsal. The mental rehearsal of natural speech involves the transformation of time-resolved speech representations in sensorimotor and premotor cortex, combined with diffuse reactivation of higher-order semantic representations.Conflict of interestThe authors declare no competing financial interests.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Active and repressed chromatin domains exhibit distinct nucleosome segregation during DNA replication, bioRxiv, 2018-09-16</h4>
          <p>SummaryChromatin domains and their associated structures must be faithfully inherited through cellular division to maintain cellular identity. Yet, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) during DNA replication is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at single desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells such that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through the local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment in the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity.</p>
