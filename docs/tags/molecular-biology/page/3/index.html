          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exercise twice-a-day potentiates skeletal muscle signalling responses associated with mitochondrial biogenesis in humans, which are independent of lowered muscle glycogen content, bioRxiv, 2019-02-12</h4>
          <p>Endurance exercise begun with reduced muscle glycogen stores seems to potentiate skeletal muscle protein abundance and gene expression. However, it is unknown whether this greater signalling responses is due to low muscle glycogen per se or to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity - as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle glycogen stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle glycogen-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle glycogen in both approaches but was performed either two or 15 h after the first exercise session (so-called twice-a-day and once-daily approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-É£ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1a), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa;) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor betadelta (PPARbd) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that the elevated molecular signalling reported with previous train-low approaches can be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity rather than the reduced muscle glycogen content per se. The twice-a-day approach might be an effective strategy to induce adaptations related to mitochondrial biogenesis and fat oxidation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ensuring meiotic DNA break formation in the mouse pseudoautosomal region Data File S1, bioRxiv, 2019-01-31</h4>
          <p>Sex chromosomes in males share only a diminutive homologous segment, the pseudoautosomal region (PAR), wherein meiotic double-strand breaks (DSBs), pairing, and crossing over must occur for correct segregation. How cells ensure PAR recombination is unknown. Here we delineate cis- and trans-acting factors that control PAR ultrastructure and make the PAR the hottest area of DSB formation in the male mouse genome. Prior to DSB formation, PAR chromosome axes elongate, sister chromatids separate, and DSB-promoting factors hyperaccumulate. These phenomena are linked to mo-2 minisatellite arrays and require ANKRD31 protein. We propose that the repetitive PAR sequence confers unique chromatin and higher order structures crucial for DSB formation, X-Y pairing, and recombination. Our findings establish a mechanistic paradigm of mammalian sex chromosome segregation during spermatogenesis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">RNA interactions with CTCF are essential for its proper function Supplemental Figures 1-5, bioRxiv, 2019-01-25</h4>
          <p>The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms of how CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization is not clear. We previously discovered that CTCF binds to large numbers of endogenous RNAs; promoting its oligomerization. Here we found that inhibition of transcription or interfering with CTCF ability to bind RNA through mutations of two of its 11 zinc fingers that are not involved with CTCF binding to its cognate site in vitro, zinc finger-1 (ZF1) or -10 (ZF10), disrupt CTCF association to chromatin. These mutations alter gene expression profiles as CTCF mutants lose their ability to promote local insulation. Our results highlight the importance of RNA as a structural component of the genome, in part by affecting the association of CTCF with chromatin and likely its interaction with other factors.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Simultaneous quantification of protein-DNA contacts and transcriptomes in single cells Supplemental Figures, bioRxiv, 2019-01-25</h4>
          <p>The epigenome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells. However, understanding how cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the epigenome influences gene expression variability remains a major challenge. Here we report a novel method for simultaneous single-cell quantification of protein-DNA contacts with DamID and transcriptomics (scDamID&amp;amp;T). This method enables quantifying the impact of protein-DNA contacts on gene expression from the same cell. By profiling lamina-associated domains (LADs) in human cells, we reveal different dependencies between genome-nuclear lamina (NL) association and gene expression in single cells. In addition, we introduce the E. coli methyltransferase, Dam, as an in vivo marker of chromatin accessibility in single cells and show that scDamID&amp;amp;T can be utilized as a general technology to identify cell types in silico while simultaneously determining the underlying gene-regulatory landscape. With this strategy the effect of chromatin states, transcription factor binding, and genome organization on the acquisition of cell-type specific transcriptional programs can be quantified.</p>

          <p>The field of epitranscriptomics has undergone an enormous expansion in the last few years; however, a major limitation is the lack of generic methods to map RNA modifications transcriptome-wide. Here we show that using Oxford Nanopore Technologies, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications can be detected with high accuracy, in the form of systematic errors and decreased base-calling qualities. Our results open new avenues to investigate the universe of RNA modifications with single nucleotide resolution, in individual RNA molecules.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">TADs pair homologous chromosomes to promote interchromosomal gene regulation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractHomologous chromosomes colocalize to regulate gene expression in processes including genomic imprinting and X-inactivation, but the mechanisms driving these interactions are poorly understood. In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting an interchromosomal gene regulatory mechanism called transvection. Despite over a century of study, the molecular features that facilitate chromosome-wide pairing are unknown. The âbuttonâ model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with a higher affinity than their surrounding regions, but only a handful of DNA elements that drive homologous pairing between chromosomes have been described. Here, we identify button loci interspersed across the fly genome that have the ability to pair with their homologous sequences. Buttons are characterized by topologically associated domains (TADs), which drive pairing with their endogenous loci from multiple locations in the genome. Fragments of TADs do not pair, suggesting a model in which combinations of elements interspersed along the full length of a TAD are required for pairing. Though DNA-binding insulator proteins are not associated with pairing, buttons are enriched for insulator cofactors, suggesting that these proteins may mediate higher order interactions between homologous TADs. Using a TAD spanning the spinelessd gene as a paradigm, we find that pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. spineless pairing and transvection are cell-type-specific, suggesting that local buttoning and unbuttoning regulates transvection efficiency between cell types. Together, our data support a model in which specialized TADs button homologous chromosomes together to facilitate cell-type-specific interchromosomal gene regulation.</p>
