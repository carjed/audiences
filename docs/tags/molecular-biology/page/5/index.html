          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Long-read sequencing of nascent RNA reveals coupling among RNA processing events, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractPre-mRNA splicing is accomplished by the spliceosome, a megadalton complex that assembles de novo on each intron. Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur co-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing, due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products (mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here, we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent, multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Most multi-intron transcripts were fully spliced, consistent with rapid co-transcriptional splicing. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts were either fully spliced or fully unspliced, suggesting that splicing of any given intron is dependent on the splicing status of other introns in the transcript. Supporting this, mild inhibition of splicing by a temperature-sensitive mutation in Prp2, the homolog of vertebrate U2AF65, increased the frequency of fully unspliced transcripts. Importantly, fully unspliced transcripts displayed transcriptional read-through at the polyA site and were degraded co-transcriptionally by the nuclear exosome. Finally, we show that cellular mRNA levels were reduced in genes with a high number of unspliced nascent transcripts during caffeine treatment, showing regulatory significance of co-transcriptional splicing. Therefore, overall splicing of individual nascent transcripts, 3’ end formation, and mRNA half-life depend on the splicing status of neighboring introns, suggesting crosstalk among spliceosomes and the polyA cleavage machinery during transcription elongation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Isolation of nucleic acids from low biomass samples detection and removal of sRNA contaminants, bioRxiv, 2017-12-15</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBackgroundSequencing-based analyses of low-biomass samples are known to be prone to misinterpretation due to the potential presence of contaminating molecules derived from laboratory reagents and environments. Due to its inherent instability, contamination with RNA is usually considered to be unlikely.ResultsHere we report the presence of small RNA (sRNA) contaminants in widely used microRNA extraction kits and means for their depletion. Sequencing of sRNAs extracted from human plasma samples was performed and significant levels of non-human (exogenous) sequences were detected. The source of the most abundant of these sequences could be traced to the microRNA extraction columns by qPCR-based analysis of laboratory reagents. The presence of artefactual sequences originating from the confirmed contaminants were furthermore replicated in a range of published datasets. To avoid artefacts in future experiments, several protocols for the removal of the contaminants were elaborated, minimal amounts of starting material for artefact-free analyses were defined, and the reduction of contaminant levels for identification of bona fide sequences using ‘ultraclean’ extraction kits was confirmed.ConclusionThis is the first report of the presence of RNA molecules as contaminants in laboratory reagents. The described protocols should be applied in the future to avoid confounding sRNA studies.</p>

          <p>SummaryTools to understand how the spliceosome functions in vivo have lagged behind advances in its structural biology. We describe methods to globally profile spliceosome-bound precursor, intermediates and products at nucleotide resolution. We apply these tools to three divergent yeast species that span 600 million years of evolution. The sensitivity of the approach enables detection of novel cases of non-canonical catalysis including interrupted, recursive and nested splicing. Employing statistical modeling to understand the quantitative relationships between RNA features and the data, we uncover independent roles for intron size, position and number in substrate progression through the two catalytic stages. These include species-specific inputs suggestive of spliceosome-transcriptome coevolution. Further investigations reveal ATP-dependent discard of numerous endogenous substrates at both the precursor and lariat-intermediate stages and connect discard to intron retention, a form of splicing regulation. Spliceosome profiling is a quantitative, generalizable global technology to investigate an RNP central to eukaryotic gene expression.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Measurement of spliceosome-bound precursor and intermediate in three species&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Non-canonical splicing events revealed&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Statistical modeling uncovers substrate features that predict catalytic efficiency&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Discard of suboptimal substrates occurs in vivo and predicts intron-retained mRNAs&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Epigenetic maintenance of DNA methylation after evolutionary loss of the de novo methyltransferase, bioRxiv, 2017-06-14</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTAfter the initial establishment of symmetric cytosine methylation patterns by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), maintenance DNMTs mediate epigenetic memory by propagating the initial signal. We find that CG methylation in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans is dependent on a purely epigenetic mechanism mediated by the single DNMT encoded by the genome, Dnmt5. Purified Dnmt5 is a maintenance methyltransferase that strictly requires a hemimethylated substrate, and methylation lost by removal of Dnmt5 in vivo is not restored by its mitotic or meiotic reintroduction. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that the ancestral species had a second methyltransferase, DnmtX, whose gene was lost between 50 and 150 Mya. Expression of extant DnmtXs in C. neoformans triggers de novo methylation. These data indicate that DNA methylation has been maintained epigenetically by the Dnmt5 system since the ancient loss of the DnmtX de novo enzyme, implying remarkably long-lived epigenetic memory.Single sentence summaryEpigenetic information can be inherited over geological timescales</p>
