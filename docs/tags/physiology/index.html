          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling in aged rats counteracts the decline in muscle mass and reverses multiple parameters of muscle signaling associated with sarcopenia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractThere is a lack of pharmacological interventions available for sarcopenia, a progressive age-associated loss of muscle mass, leading to a decline in mobility and quality of life. We found mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1), a well-established critical positive modulator of mass, to be hyperactivated in sarcopenic muscle. Furthermore, inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway counteracted sarcopenia as determined by observing an increase in muscle mass and fiber type cross sectional area, surprising because mTORC1 signaling has been shown to be required for muscle mass gains in some settings. Additionally, several genes related to senescence were downregulated, while gene expression indicators of neuromuscular junction denervation were diminished using a low dose of a rapalog. Therefore mTORC1 inhibition may delay the progression of sarcopenia by directly and indirectly modulating multiple age-associated pathways, implicating mTORC1 as a therapeutic target to treat sarcopenia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Carbs versus fat does it really matter for maintaining lost weight?, bioRxiv, 2018-11-28</h4>
          <p>The most read article of 2018 published in The BMJ (httpsdoi.org10.1136bmj.k4583) claimed that restricting dietary carbohydrates offers a metabolic advantage to burn more calories and thereby help patients maintain lost weight. However, analyzing the data according to the original pre-registered statistical plan resulted in no statistically significant effects of diet composition on energy expenditure. The large reported diet effects on energy expenditure calculated using the revised analysis plan depended on data from subjects with excessive amounts of unaccounted energy. Adjusting the data to be commensurate with energy conservation resulted in a diet effect that was less than half the value reported in The BMJ paper. Furthermore, the measured daily average CO2 production rates were not significantly different between the diets and the reported expenditure differences were due to inaccurate calculations based on false assumptions about diet adherence.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Objective versus Self-Reported Energy Intake Changes During Low-Carbohydrate and Low-Fat Diets, bioRxiv, 2018-09-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractObjectiveTo examine objective versus self-reported energy intake changes (ΔEI) during a 12-month diet intervention.MethodsWe calculated ΔEI in subjects who participated in a 1-year randomized low-carbohydrate versus low-fat diet trial using repeated body weight measurements as inputs to an objective mathematical model (ΔEIModel) and compared these values with self-reported energy intake changes assessed by repeated 24-hr recalls (ΔEI24hrRecall).ResultsΔEI24hrRecall indicated a relatively persistent state of calorie restriction ≥500 kcald throughout the year with no significant differences between diets. ΔEIModel demonstrated large early decreases in calorie intake &amp;gt;800 kcald followed by an exponential return to approximately 100 kcald below baseline at the end of the year. The low-carbohydrate diet resulted in ΔEIModel that was 162±53 kcald lower than the low-fat diet over the first 3 months (p=0.002), but no significant diet differences were found at later times. Weight loss at 12 months was significantly related to ΔEIModel at all time intervals for both diets (p&amp;lt;0.0001).ConclusionsSelf-reported measurements of ΔEI were inaccurate. Model-based calculations of ΔEI found that instructions to follow the low-carbohydrate diet resulted in greater calorie restriction than the low-fat diet in the early phases of the intervention, but these diet differences were not sustained.What is already known about this subject?&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Diet assessments that rely on self-report, such as 24hr dietary recall, are known to underestimate actual energy intake as measured by doubly labeled water. However, it is possible that repeated self-reported measurements could accurately detect changes in energy intake over time if the absolute bias of self-reported of measurements is approximately constant for each subject.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;What this study adds&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;We compared energy intake changes measured using repeated 24hr dietary recall measurements collected over the course of the 1-year Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) trial versus energy intake changes calculated using repeated body weight measurements as inputs to a validated mathematical model.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Whereas self-reported measurements indicated a relatively persistent state of calorie restriction, objective model-based measurements demonstrated a large early calorie restriction followed by an exponential rise in energy intake towards the pre-intervention baseline.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Model-based calculations, but not self-reported measurements, found that low-carbohydrate diets led to significantly greater early decreases in energy intake compared to low-fat diets, but long-term energy intake changes were not significantly different.&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The dynamic upper limit of human lifespan, bioRxiv, 2017-04-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe respond to claims by Dong et al. that human lifespan is limited below 125 years. Using the log-linear increase in mortality rates with age to predict the upper limits of human survival we find, in contrast to Dong et al., that the limit to human lifespan is historically flexible and increasing. This discrepancy can be explained by Dong et al.’s use of data with variable sample sizes, age-biased rounding errors, and log(0) instead of log(1) values in linear regressions. Addressing these issues eliminates the proposed 125-year upper limit to human lifespan.</p>
