          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, bioRxiv, 2019-04-30</h4>
          <p>AbstractIn the field of artificial intelligence, a combination of scale in data and model capacity enabled by unsupervised learning has led to major advances in representation learning and statistical generation. In biology, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Learning the natural distribution of evolutionary protein sequence variation is a logical step toward predictive and generative modeling for biology. To this end we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model maps raw sequences to representations of biological properties without labels or prior domain knowledge. The learned representation space organizes sequences at multiple levels of biological granularity from the biochemical to proteomic levels. Unsupervised learning recovers information about protein structure secondary structure and residue-residue contacts can be identified by linear projections from the learned representations. Training language models on full sequence diversity rather than individual protein families increases recoverable information about secondary structure. The unsupervised models can be adapted with supervision from quantitative mutagenesis data to predict variant activity. Predictions from sequences alone are comparable to results from a state-of-the-art model of mutational effects that uses evolutionary and structurally derived features.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Water Contaminants Using Regulated In Vitro Transcription, bioRxiv, 2019-04-26</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTSynthetic biology has enabled the development of powerful nucleic acid diagnostic technologies for detecting pathogens and human health biomarkers. Here we expand the reach of synthetic biology-enabled diagnostics by developing a cell-free biosensing platform that uses RNA output sensors activated by ligand induction (ROSALIND) to detect harmful contaminants in aqueous samples. ROSALIND consists of three programmable components highly-processive RNA polymerases, allosteric transcription factors, and synthetic DNA transcription templates. Together, these components allosterically regulate the in vitro transcription of a fluorescence-activating RNA aptamer in the absence of a target compound, transcription is blocked, while in its presence a fluorescent signal is produced. We demonstrate that ROSALIND can be configured to detect a range of water contaminants, including antibiotics, toxic small molecules, and metals. Our cell-free biosensing platform, which can be freeze-dried for field deployment, creates a new capability for point-of-use monitoring of molecular species to address growing global crises in water quality and human health.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Unified rational protein engineering with sequence-only deep representation learning, bioRxiv, 2019-03-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractRational protein engineering requires a holistic understanding of protein function. Here, we apply deep learning to unlabelled amino acid sequences to distill the fundamental features of a protein into a statistical representation that is semantically rich and structurally, evolutionarily, and biophysically grounded. We show that the simplest models built on top of this unified representation (UniRep) are broadly applicable and generalize to unseen regions of sequence space. Our data-driven approach reaches near state-of-the-art or superior performance predicting stability of natural and de novo designed proteins as well as quantitative function of molecularly diverse mutants. UniRep further enables two orders of magnitude cost savings in a protein engineering task. We conclude UniRep is a versatile protein summary that can be applied across protein engineering informatics.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Enabling large-scale genome editing by reducing DNA nicking, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo extend the frontier of genome editing and enable the radical redesign of mammalian genomes, we developed a set of dead-Cas9 base editor (dBE) variants that allow editing at tens of thousands of loci per cell by overcoming the cell death associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs). We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elements – ranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded. These dBEs can overcome current on-target mutation and toxicity barriers that prevent cell survival after large-scale genome engineering.One Sentence SummaryBase editing with reduced DNA nicking allows for the simultaneous editing of &amp;gt;10,000 loci in human cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Engineering Brain Parasites for Intracellular Delivery of Therapeutic Proteins, bioRxiv, 2018-12-03</h4>
          <p>Protein therapy has the potential to alleviate many neurological diseases; however, delivery mechanisms for the central nervous system (CNS) are limited, and intracellular delivery poses additional hurdles. To address these challenges, we harnessed the protist parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which can migrate into the CNS and secrete proteins into cells. Using a fusion protein approach, we engineered T. gondii to secrete therapeutic proteins for human neurological disorders. We tested two secretion systems, generated fusion proteins that localized to the secretory organelles of T. gondii and assessed their intracellular targeting in various mammalian cells including neurons. We show that T. gondii expressing GRA16 fused to the Rett syndrome protein MeCP2 deliver a fusion protein that mimics the endogenous MeCP2, binding heterochromatic DNA in neurons. This demonstrates the potential of T. gondii as a therapeutic protein vector, which could provide either transient or chronic, in situ synthesis and delivery of intracellular proteins to the CNS.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Variability of bacterial behavior in the mammalian gut captured using a growth-linked single-cell synthetic gene oscillator, bioRxiv, 2018-11-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe dynamics of the bacterial population that comprises the gut microbiota plays key roles in overall mammalian health. However, a detailed understanding of bacterial growth within the gut is limited by the inherent complexity and inaccessibility of the gut environment. Here, we deploy an improved synthetic genetic oscillator to investigate dynamics of bacterial colonization and growth in the mammalian gut under both healthy and disease conditions. The synthetic oscillator, when introduced into both Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium maintains regular oscillations with a constant period in generations across growth conditions. We determine the phase of oscillation from individual bacteria using image analysis of resultant colonies and thereby infer the number of cell divisions elapsed. In doing so, we demonstrate robust functionality and controllability of the oscillator circuit’s activity during bacterial growth in vitro, in a simulated murine gut microfluidic environment, and in vivo within the mouse gut. We determine different dynamics of bacterial colonization and growth in the gut under normal and inflammatory conditions. Our results show that a precise genetic oscillator can function in a complex environment and reveal single cell behavior under diverse conditions where disease may create otherwise impossible-to-quantify variability in growth across the population.</p>
