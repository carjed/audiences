Each report is a self-contained .html file, so you can simply to your own personal website. (e.g., if you have a list of your lab's papers on your website, you can generate a report for each and add a link to the corresponding .html) Alternatively, if you have forked the Audiences Github repository, you can use Github pages to host the reports. I am using Hugo with the hugrid template to create a simple static landing page with tiles that link to static/reports/report.html .
