          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exploring neighborhoods in large metagenome assembly graphs reveals hidden sequence diversity, bioRxiv, 2018-11-06</h4>
          <p>Genomes computationally inferred from large metagenomic data sets are often incomplete and may be missing functionally important content and strain variation. We introduce an information retrieval system for large metagenomic data sets that exploits the sparsity of DNA assembly graphs to efficiently extract subgraphs surrounding an inferred genome. We apply this system to recover missing content from genome bins and show that substantial genomic sequence variation is present in a real metagenome.

          <p>AbstractObjectiveTo examine whether sleep traits have a causal effect on risk of breast cancer.DesignMultivariable regression, one- and two-sample Mendelian randomization.SettingThe UK Biobank prospective cohort study and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) case-control genome-wide association study.Participants156,848 women in the multivariable regression and one-sample Mendelian randomization analysis in UK Biobank (7,784 with a breast cancer diagnosis) and 122,977 breast cancer cases and 105,974 controls from BCAC in the two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.ExposuresSelf-reported chronotype (morningevening preference), insomnia symptoms and sleep duration in multivariable regression, and genetic variants robustly associated with these sleep traits.Main outcome measuresBreast cancer (prevalent and incident cases in UK Biobank, prevalent cases only in BCAC).ResultsIn multivariable regression analysis using data on breast cancer incidence in UK Biobank, morning preference was inversely associated with breast cancer (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93, 0.98 per category increase) while there was little evidence for an association with sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Using 341 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with chronotype, 91 SNPs associated sleep duration and 57 SNPs associated with insomnia symptoms, one-sample MR analysis in UK Biobank provided some supportive evidence for a protective effect of morning preference on breast cancer risk (HR 0.85, 95% 0.70, 1.03 per category increase) but imprecise estimates for sleep duration and insomnia symptoms. Two-sample MR using data from BCAC supported findings for a protective effect of morning preference (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82, 0.93 per category increase) and adverse effect of increased sleep duration (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02, 1.39 per hour increase) on breast cancer (both estrogen receptor positive and negative), while there was inconsistent evidence for insomnia symptoms. Results were largely robust to sensitivity analyses accounting for horizontal pleiotropy.ConclusionsWe found consistent evidence for a protective effect of morning preference and suggestive evidence for an adverse effect of sleep duration on breast cancer risk.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Structure of a bacterial ATP synthase, bioRxiv, 2018-11-06</h4>
          <p>ATP synthases produce ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate with energy from a transmembrane proton motive force. Bacterial ATP synthases have been studied extensively because they are the simplest form of the enzyme and because of the relative ease of genetic manipulation of these complexes. We expressed the Bacillus PS3 ATP synthase in Eschericia coli, purified it, and imaged it by cryo-EM, allowing us to build atomic models of the complex in three rotational states. The position of subunit e shows how it is able to inhibit ATP hydrolysis while allowing ATP synthesis. The architecture of the membrane region shows how the simple bacterial ATP synthase is able to perform the same core functions as the equivalent, but more complicated, mitochondrial complex. The structures reveal the path of transmembrane proton translocation and provide a model for understanding decades of biochemical analysis interrogating the roles of specific residues in the enzyme.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Fast, sensitive, and accurate integration of single cell data with Harmony, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe rapidly emerging diversity of single cell RNAseq datasets allows us to characterize the transcriptional behavior of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of ∼ 106 cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes. Harmony is a fast and flexible general purpose integration algorithm that enables the identification of shared fine-grained subpopulations across a variety of experimental and biological conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Neural Population Control via Deep Image Synthesis, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today’s most accurate models of the primate brain’s ventral visual stream. Here we report that, using a targeted ANN-driven image synthesis method, new luminous power patterns (i.e. images) can be applied to the primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. More importantly, this method, while not yet perfect, already achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today’s ANN models might be used to non-invasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">On the adaptive behavior of head-fixed flies navigating in two-dimensional, visual virtual reality, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05</h4>
          <p>AbstractA navigating animal’s sensory experience is shaped not just by its surroundings, but by its movements within them, which in turn are influenced by its past experiences. Studying the intertwined roles of sensation, experience and directed action in navigation has been made easier by the development of virtual reality (VR) environments for head-fixed animals, which allow for quantitative measurements of behavior in well-controlled sensory conditions. VR has long featured in studies of Drosophila melanogaster, but these experiments have typically relied on one-dimensional (1D) VR, effectively allowing the fly to change only its heading in a visual scene, and not its position. Here we explore how flies navigate in a two-dimensional (2D) visual VR environment that more closely resembles their experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ interaction with landmarks in 2D environments cannot be automatically derived from their behavior in simpler 1D environments. Using a novel paradigm, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D VR adapt their behavior in a visual environment in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search behavior. Finally, by pairing optogenetic activation of heat-sensing cells to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of landmarks associated with aversive “virtual heat”. These head-fixed paradigms set the stage for an interrogation of fly brain circuitry underlying flexible navigation in complex visual environments.</p>
