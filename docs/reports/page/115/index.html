          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Computational noise in reward-guided learning drives behavioral variability in volatile environments, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractWhen learning the value of actions in volatile environments, humans often make seemingly irrational decisions which fail to maximize expected value. We reasoned that these ‘non-greedy’ decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here, using reinforcement learning (RL) models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stems from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by BOLD responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and by phasic pupillary dilation – suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Together, these findings indicate that most of behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Current clinical use of polygenic scores will risk exacerbating health disparities, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11</h4>
          <p>Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation is that they are many-fold more accurate in European ancestry individuals than others. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric genome-wide association study biases. This highlights that--unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations--clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement to European descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in levelling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date. To realize the full and equitable potential of PRS, we must prioritize greater diversity in genetic studies and public dissemination of summary statistics to ensure that health disparities are not increased for those already most underserved.</p>

          <p>AbstractIdentifying the genetic and environmental factors underlying phenotypic differences between populations is fundamental to multiple research communities. To date, studies have focused on the relationship between population and phenotypic mean. Here we consider the relationship between population and phenotypic variance, i.e., “population variance structure.” In addition to gene-gene and gene-environment interaction, we show that population variance structure is a direct consequence of natural selection. We develop the ancestry double generalized linear model (ADGLM), a statistical framework to jointly model population mean and variance effects. We apply ADGLM to several deeply phenotyped datasets and observe ancestry-variance associations with 12 of 44 tested traits in ~113K British individuals and 3 of 14 tested traits in ~3K Mexican, Puerto Rican, and African-American individuals. We show through extensive simulations that population variance structure can both bias and reduce the power of genetic association studies, even when principal components or linear mixed models are used. ADGLM corrects this bias and improves power relative to previous methods in both simulated and real datasets. Additionally, ADGLM identifies 17 novel genotype-variance associations across six phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">First detection of a highly invasive freshwater amphipod (Crangonyx floridanus) in the United Kingdom, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe freshwater gammarid, Crangonyx floridanus, originates from North America but has invaded and subsequently spread rapidly throughout Japan. We provide here the first genetic and microscopic evidence that C. floridanus has now also reached the United Kingdom. We found this species in two locations separated by more than 200 km (Lake Windermere in the North of the UK and Smestow Brook, West Midlands). The current distribution of C. floridanus is currently unknown, however both sites are well connected to other river and channel systems therefore the chance of further spread is high. Genetic analyses of C. floridanus indicate that British inland waters are colonised by the same linage, which also has invaded Japan. We recommend further work to assess the distribution of this species and its impact on the local fauna and flora.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Functional clustering of dendritic activity during decision-making, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11</h4>
          <p>SummaryThe active properties of dendrites support local nonlinear operations, but previous imaging and electrophysiological measurements have produced conflicting views regarding the prevalence of local nonlinearities in vivo. We imaged calcium signals in pyramidal cell dendrites in the motor cortex of mice performing a tactile decision task. A custom microscope allowed us to image the soma and up to 300 μm of contiguous dendrite at 15 Hz, while resolving individual spines. New analysis methods were used to estimate the frequency and spatial scales of activity in dendritic branches and spines. The majority of dendritic calcium transients were coincident with global events. However, task-associated calcium signals in dendrites and spines were compartmentalized by dendritic branching and clustered within branches over approximately 10 μm. Diverse behavior-related signals were intermingled and distributed throughout the dendritic arbor, potentially supporting a large computational repertoire and learning capacity in individual neurons.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Minimal phenotyping yields GWAS hits of low specificity for major depression, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractMinimal phenotyping refers to the reliance on self-reported responses to one or two questions for disease case identification. This strategy has been applied to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we report that the genotype derived heritability (h2SNP) of depression defined by minimal phenotyping (14%, SE = 0.8%) is lower than strictly defined MDD (26%, SE = 2.2%), and that it shares as much genetic liability with strictly defined MDD (0.81, SE = 0.03) as it does with neuroticism (0.84, SE = 0.05), a trait not defined by the cardinal symptoms of depression. While they both show similar shared genetic liability with the personality trait neuroticism, a greater proportion of the genome contribute to the minimal phenotyping definitions of depression (80.2%, SE = 0.6%) than to strictly defined MDD (65.8%, SE = 0.6%). We find that GWAS loci identified in minimal phenotyping definitions of depression are not specific to MDD they also predispose to other psychiatric conditions. Finally, genetic predictors based on minimal phenotyping definitions are not predictive of strictly defined MDD in independent cohorts. Our results reveal that genetic analysis of minimal phenotyping definitions of depression identifies non-specific genetic factors shared between MDD and other psychiatric conditions. Reliance on results from minimal phenotyping for MDD may thus bias views of the genetic architecture of MDD and impedes ability to identify pathways specific to MDD.</p>
