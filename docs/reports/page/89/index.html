          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Basal Contamination of Bulk Sequencing Lessons from the GTEx dataset, bioRxiv, 2019-04-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundOne of the challenges of next generation sequencing (NGS) is contaminating reads from other samples. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a large, diverse, and robustly generated dataset, as a useful resource to understand the factors that contribute to contamination.ResultsWe obtained 11,340 RNA-Seq samples, DNA variant call files (VCF) of 635 individuals, and technical metadata from GTEx as well as read count data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and a pharmacogenetics study. We analyzed 48 tissues in GTEx. Of these, 24 had variant co-expression clusters of four known highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and CELA3A). Fifteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues were also indicative of contamination (KRT4, KRT13, PGC, CPA1, GP2, PRL, LIPF, CTRB2, FGA, HP, CKM, FGG, MYBPC1, MYH2, ZG16B). Sample contamination by non-native genes was highly associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively has high levels of those genes. This was highly significant for both pancreas genes (p= 2.7E-75) and esophagus genes (p= 8.9E-154). We used genetic polymorphism differences between individuals as validation of the contamination. Specifically, 11 SNPs in five genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes. Low-level contamination affected 1,841 (15.8%) samples (defined as ≥500 PRSS1 read counts). It also led to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 19 genes. In support of this type of contamination occurring widely, pancreas gene contamination (PRSS1) was also observed in the HPA dataset, where pancreas samples were sequenced, but not in the pharmacogenomics dataset, where they were not.ConclusionsHighly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate the GTEx dataset impacting on some downstream GTEx data analyses. This type of contamination is not unique to GTEx, being shared with other datasets. Awareness of this process will reduce assigning variable, contaminating low-level gene expression to disease processes.</p>

Fourteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues also indicated contamination. Sample contamination by non-native genes was associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively expressed those genes. This was highly significant for pancreas and esophagus genes (linear model, p=9.5e-237 and p=5e-260 respectively). Nine SNPs in four genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes, validating the contamination. Low-level contamination affected 4,497 (39.6%) samples (defined as 10 PRSS1 TPM). It also led ≥ to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 18 genes. We note this type of contamination occurs widely, impacting bulk and single cell data set analysis. In conclusion, highly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate GTEx and other datasets impacting analyses. Awareness of this process is necessary to avoid assigning inaccurate importance to low-level gene expression in inappropriate tissues and cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Native molecule sequencing by nano-ID reveals synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractEukaryotic genes often generate a variety of RNA isoforms that can lead to functionally distinct protein variants. The synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms is however poorly characterized. The reason for this is that current methods to quantify RNA metabolism use ‘short-read’ sequencing that cannot detect RNA isoforms. Here we present nanopore sequencing-based Isoform Dynamics (nano-ID), a method that detects newly synthesized RNA isoforms and monitors isoform metabolism. nano-ID combines metabolic RNA labeling, ‘long-read’ nanopore sequencing of native RNA molecules and machine learning. Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Tunability of DNA polymerase stability during eukaryotic DNA replication, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>SummaryStructural and biochemical studies have revealed the basic principles of how the replisome duplicates genomic DNA, but little is known about its dynamics during DNA replication. We reconstitute the 34 proteins needed to form the S. cerevisiae replisome and show how changing local concentrations of the key DNA polymerases tunes the ability of the complex to efficiently recycle these proteins or to dynamically exchange them. Particularly, we demonstrate redundancy of the Pol α DNA polymerase activity in replication and show that Pol α primase and the lagging-strand Pol δ can be re-used within the replisome to support the synthesis of large numbers of Okazaki fragments. This unexpected malleability of the replisome might allow it to deal with barriers and resource challenges during replication of large genomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Whole genome phylogenies reflect long-tailed distributions of recombination rates in many bacterial species, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlthough homologous recombination is accepted to be common in bacteria, so far it has been challenging to accurately quantify its impact on genome evolution within bacterial species. We here introduce methods that use the statistics of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) splits in the core genome alignment of a set of strains to show that, for many bacterial species, recombination dominates genome evolution. Each genomic locus has been overwritten so many times by recombination that it is impossible to reconstruct the clonal phylogeny and, instead of a consensus phylogeny, the phylogeny typically changes many thousands of times along the core genome alignment.We also show how SNP splits can be used to quantify the relative rates with which different subsets of strains have recombined in the past. We find that virtually every strain has a unique pattern of recombination frequencies with other strains and that the relative rates with which different subsets of strains share SNPs follow long-tailed distributions. Our findings show that bacterial populations are neither clonal nor freely recombining, but structured such that recombination rates between different lineages vary along a continuum spanning several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage. Thus, rather than reflecting clonal ancestry, whole genome phylogenies reflect these long-tailed distributions of recombination rates.</p>
