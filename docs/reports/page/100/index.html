          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Simultaneous mesoscopic and two-photon imaging of neuronal activity in cortical circuits, bioRxiv, 2018-11-12</h4>
          <p>AbstractSpontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across spatial scales in the mammalian cortex but technical challenges have generally precluded establishing conceptual links between the function of local circuits of neurons and brain-wide network dynamics. To solve this problem, we developed a method for simultaneous cellular-resolution two-photon calcium imaging of a local microcircuit and mesoscopic widefield calcium imaging of the entire cortical mantle in awake, behaving mice. Our method employs an orthogonal axis design whereby the mesoscopic objective is oriented downward directly above the brain and the two-photon objective is oriented horizontally, with imaging performed through a glass right angle microprism implanted in the skull. In support of this method, we introduce a suite of analysis tools for relating the activity of individual cells to distal cortical areas, as well as a viral method for robust and widespread gene delivery in the juvenile mouse brain. We use these methods to characterize the diversity of associations of individual, genetically-defined neurons with cortex-wide network motifs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An atlas of polygenic risk score associations to highlight putative causal relationships across the human phenome, bioRxiv, 2018-11-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe age of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has provided us with an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the genetic liability of complex disease using polygenic risk scores (PRS). In this study, we have analysed 162 PRS (P&amp;lt;5×l0 05) derived from GWAS and 551 heritable traits from the UK Biobank study (N=334,398). Findings can be investigated using a web application (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpmrcieu.mrsoftware.orgPRS_atlas&gt;httpmrcieu.mrsoftware.orgPRS_atlas&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), which we envisage will help uncover both known and novel mechanisms which contribute towards disease susceptibility.To demonstrate this, we have investigated the results from a phenome-wide evaluation of schizophrenia genetic liability. Amongst findings were inverse associations with measures of cognitive function which extensive follow-up analyses using Mendelian randomization (MR) provided evidence of a causal relationship. We have also investigated the effect of multiple risk factors on disease using mediation and multivariable MR frameworks. Our atlas provides a resource for future endeavours seeking to unravel the causal determinants of complex disease.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Lineage tracing on transcriptional landscapes links state to fate during differentiation, bioRxiv, 2018-11-11</h4>
          <p>AbstractA challenge in stem cell biology is to associate molecular differences among progenitor cells with their capacity to generate mature cell types. Though the development of single cell assays allows for the capture of progenitor cell states in great detail, these assays cannot definitively link cell states to their long-term fate. Here, we use expressed DNA barcodes to clonally trace single cell transcriptomes dynamically during differentiation and apply this approach to the study of hematopoiesis. Our analysis identifies functional boundaries of cell potential early in the hematopoietic hierarchy and locates them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We reconstruct a developmental hierarchy showing separate ontogenies for granulocytic subtypes and two routes to monocyte differentiation that leave a persistent imprint on mature cells. Finally, we use our approach to benchmark methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, and provide evidence of strong early fate biases dependent on cellular properties hidden from single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Nanopore native RNA sequencing of a human poly(A) transcriptome, bioRxiv, 2018-11-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTHigh throughput cDNA sequencing technologies have dramatically advanced our understanding of transcriptome complexity and regulation. However, these methods lose information contained in biological RNA because the copied reads are often short and because modifications are not carried forward in cDNA. We address these limitations using a native poly(A) RNA sequencing strategy developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). Our study focused on poly(A) RNA from the human cell line GM12878, generating 9.9 million aligned sequence reads. These native RNA reads had an aligned N50 length of 1294 bases, and a maximum aligned length of over 21,000 bases. A total of 78,199 high-confidence isoforms were identified by combining long nanopore reads with short higher accuracy Illumina reads. We describe strategies for assessing 3′ poly(A) tail length, base modifications and transcript haplotypes from nanopore RNA data. Together, these nanopore-based techniques are poised to deliver new insights into RNA biology.DISCLOSURESMA holds shares in Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). MA is a paid consultant to ONT.

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A polyploid admixed origin of beer yeasts derived from European and Asian wine populations, bioRxiv, 2018-11-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractStrains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae used to make beer, bread and wine are genetically and phenotypically distinct from wild populations associated with trees. The origins of these domesticated populations are not always clear; human-associated migration and admixture with wild populations have had a strong impact on S. cerevisiae population structure. We examined the population genetic history of beer strains and find that ale strains and the S. cerevisiae portion of allotetraploid lager strains were derived from admixture between populations closely related to European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to both lager and baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing them with a passive means of remaining isolated from other populations and providing us with a living relic of their ancestral hybridization. To reconstruct their polyploid origin we phased the genomes of two ale strains and found ale haplotypes to both be recombinants between European and Asian alleles and to also contain novel alleles derived from extinct or as yet uncharacterized populations. We conclude that modern beer strains are the product of a historical melting pot of fermentation technology.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTRapid technological progress in the recent years has allowed the high-throughput interrogation of different types of biomolecules from single cells. Combining several of these readouts into integrated multi-omic assays is essential to comprehensively understand and model cellular processes. Here, we report the development of Expanded CRISPR-compatible Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (ECCITE-seq) for the high-throughput characterization of at least five modalities of information from each single cell transcriptome, immune receptor clonotypes, surface markers, sample identity and sgRNAs. We demonstrate the use of ECCITE-seq to directly and efficiently capture sgRNA molecules and measure their effects on gene expression and protein levels, opening the possibility of performing high throughput single cell CRISPR screens with multimodal readout using existing libraries and commonly used vectors. Finally, by utilizing the combined phenotyping of clonotype and cell surface markers in immune cells, we apply ECCITE to study a lymphoma sample to discriminate cells and define molecular signatures of malignant cells within a heterogeneous population.</p>
