          <p>AbstractA central problem in evolutionary biology is to infer the full genealogical history of a set of DNA sequences. This history contains rich information about the forces that have influenced a sexually reproducing species. However, existing methods are limited the most accurate is unable to cope with more than a few dozen samples. With modern genetic data sets rapidly approaching millions of genomes, there is an urgent need for efficient inference methods to exploit such rich resources. We introduce an algorithm to infer whole-genome history which has comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but can process around four orders of magnitude more sequences. Additionally, our method results in an “evolutionary encoding” of the original sequence data, enabling efficient access to genealogies and calculation of genetic statistics over the data. We apply this technique to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the genealogies we estimate are both rich in biological signal and efficient to process.</p>

          <p>AbstractCannabis has been cultivated for millennia with distinct cultivars providing either fiber and grain or tetrahydrocannabinol. Recent demand for cannabidiol rather than tetrahydrocannabinol has favored the breeding of admixed cultivars with extremely high cannabidiol content. Despite several draft Cannabis genomes, the genomic structure of cannabinoid synthase loci has remained elusive. A genetic map derived from a tetrahydrocannabinolcannabidiol segregating population and a complete chromosome assembly from a high-cannabidiol cultivar together resolve the linkage of cannabidiolic and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase gene clusters which are associated with transposable elements. High-cannabidiol cultivars appear to have been generated by integrating hemp-type cannabidiolic acid synthase gene clusters into a background of marijuana-type cannabis. Quantitative trait locus mapping suggests that overall drug potency, however, is associated with other genomic regions needing additional study.Resources available online at &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpcannabisgenome.org&gt;httpcannabisgenome.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt;SummaryA complete chromosome assembly and an ultra-high-density linkage map together identify the genetic mechanism responsible for the ratio of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiol (CBD) in Cannabis cultivars, allowing paradigms for the evolution and inheritance of drug potency to be evaluated.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A practical guide to methods controlling false discoveries in computational biology, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A risk-reward tradeoff of high ribosome production in proliferating cells, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo achieve maximal growth, cells must manage a massive economy of ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and RNAs (rRNAs), which are required to produce thousands of new ribosomes every minute. Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we modeled these perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result immediately in acute loss of proteostasis (protein folding homeostasis). Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes. In response, proteostasis genes are activated by an Hsf1-dependent stress response pathway that is required for recovery from r-protein assembly stress. Importantly, we show that exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. Our results highlight ribosome assembly as a linchpin of cellular homeostasis, representing a key proteostasis vulnerability for rapidly proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic conditions that generate orphan r-proteins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Immediate visualization of recombination events and chromosome segregation defects in fission yeast meiosis, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractSchizosaccharomyces pombe, also known as fission yeast, is an established model for studying chromosome biological processes. Over the years research employing fission yeast has made important contributions to our knowledge about chromosome segregation during meiosis, as well as meiotic recombination and its regulation. Quantification of meiotic recombination frequency is not a straightforward undertaking, either requiring viable progeny for a genetic plating assay, or relying on laborious Southern blot analysis of recombination intermediates. Neither of these methods lends itself to high-throughput screens to identify novel meiotic factors. Here, we establish visual assays novel to Sz. pombe for characterizing chromosome segregation and meiotic recombination phenotypes. Genes expressing red, yellow, andor cyan fluorophores from spore-autonomous promoters have been integrated into the fission yeast genomes, either close to the centromere of chromosome I to monitor chromosome segregation, or on the arm of chromosome III to form a genetic interval at which recombination frequency can be determined. The visual recombination assay allows straightforward and immediate assessment of the genetic outcome of a single meiosis by epi-fluorescence microscopy without requiring tetrad dissection. We also demonstrate that the recombination frequency analysis can be automatized by utilizing imaging flow cytometry to enable high-throughput screens. These assays have several advantages over traditional methods for analysing meiotic phenotypes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The emergence of multiple retinal cell types through efficient coding of natural movies, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractOne of the most striking aspects of early visual processing in the retina is the immediate parcellation of visual information into multiple parallel pathways, formed by different retinal ganglion cell types each tiling the entire visual field. Existing theories of efficient coding have been unable to account for the functional advantages of such cell-type diversity in encoding natural scenes. Here we go beyond previous theories to analyze how a simple linear retinal encoding model with different convolutional cell types efficiently encodes naturalistic spatiotemporal movies given a fixed firing rate budget. We find that optimizing the receptive fields and cell densities of two cell types makes them match the properties of the two main cell types in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells, in terms of spatial and temporal sensitivity, cell spacing, and their relative ratio. Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types. Thus our work provides a theoretical justification, based on the efficient coding of natural movies, for the existence of the four most dominant cell types in the primate retina that together comprise 70% of all ganglion cells.</p>
