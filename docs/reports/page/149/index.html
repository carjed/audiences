          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Estimating heritability of complex traits in admixed populations with summary statistics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-21</h4>
          <p>AbstractAll summary statistics-based methods to estimate the heritability of SNPs (hg2) rely on accurate linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculations. In admixed populations, such as African Americans and Latinos, LD estimates are influenced by admixture and can result in biased hg2 estimates. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted LD score regression (cov-LDSC), a method to provide robust hg2 estimates from GWAS summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates in admixed populations. In simulations, we observed that unadjusted LDSC underestimates hg2 by 10%-60%; in contrast, cov-LDSC is robust to all simulation parameters. We applied cov-LDSC to approximately 170,000 Latino, 47,000 African American 135,000 European individuals in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes. Our results show that most traits have high concordance of hg2 between ethnic groups; for example in the 23andMe cohort, estimates of hg2 for BMI are 0.22 ± 0.01, 0.23 ± 0.03 and 0.22 ± 0.01 in Latino, African American and European populations respectively. However, for age at menarche, we observe population specific heritability differences with estimates of hg2 of 0.10 ± 0.03, 0.33 ± 0.13 and 0.19 ± 0.01 in Latino, African American and European populations respectively.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell analysis of Crohn’s disease lesions identifies a pathogenic cellular module associated with resistance to anti-TNF therapy, bioRxiv, 2018-12-21</h4>
          <p>SummaryClinical benefits to cytokine blockade in ileal Crohn’s disease (iCD) have been limited to a subset of patients. Whether cellular and molecular heterogeneity contributes to variability in treatment responses has been unclear. Using single cell technologies combining scRNAseq, CyTOF and multiplex tissue imaging, we mapped the cellular landscape of inflamed ileum lesions, adjacent non-inflamed ileum and matched circulating blood cells of iCD patients. In inflamed tissues, we identified a pathogenic module characterized by an inflammatory mononuclear phagocyte (Inf.MNP)-associated cellular response organized around inflammatory macrophages and mature dendritic cells in a subset of iCD patients. We confirmed the Inf.MNP-associated cellular response in 4 independent iCD cohorts (n=441) and showed that presence of this pathogenic module at diagnosis correlated with primary resistance to anti-TNF therapy. Single cell mapping of iCD tissues identifies a complex cellular signature of anti-TNF resistance thereby revealing novel biomarkers of treatment response and tailored therapeutic opportunities.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">On-site ribosome remodeling by locally synthesized ribosomal proteins in axons, bioRxiv, 2018-12-20</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYRibosomes are known to be assembled in the nucleolus, yet recent studies have revealed robust enrichment and translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) in axons, far away from neuronal cell bodies. Using subcellular proteomics and live-imaging, we show that locally synthesized RPs incorporate into axonal ribosomes in a nucleolus-independent fashion. We revealed that axonal RP translation is regulated through a novel sequence motif, CUIC, that forms a RNA-loop structure in the region immediately upstream of the initiation codon. Inhibition of axonal CUIC-regulated RP translation leads to defects in local translation activity and axon branching, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the axonal ribosome remodeling. These results indicate that axonal translation supplies cytoplasmic RPs to maintainmodify local ribosomal function far from the nucleolus.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Prioritisation of oncology therapeutic targets using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, bioRxiv, 2018-12-20</h4>
          <p>SummaryFunctional genomics approaches can overcome current limitations that hamper oncology drug development such as lack of robust target identification and clinical efficacy. Here we performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 204 human cancer cell lines from 12 cancer-types and developed a data-driven framework to prioritise cancer therapeutic candidates. We integrated gene cell fitness effects with genomic biomarkers and target tractability for drug development to systematically prioritise new oncology targets in defined tissues and genotypes. Furthermore, we took one of our most promising dependencies, Werner syndrome RecQ helicase, and verified it as a candidate target for tumours with microsatellite instability. Our analysis provides a comprehensive resource of cancer dependencies, a framework to prioritise oncology targets, and nominates specific new candidates. The principles described in this study can transform the initial stages of the drug development process contributing to a new, diverse and more effective portfolio of oncology targets.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Precision Medicine Advancements Using Whole Genome Sequencing, Noninvasive Whole Body Imaging, and Functional Diagnostics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWe report the results of a three-year precision medicine study that enrolled 1190 presumed healthy participants at a single research clinic. To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imagingangiography (MRIMRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score &amp;gt; 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRIMRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Self-repair protects microtubules from their destruction by molecular motors, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18</h4>
          <p>Microtubules are dynamic polymers that are used for intracellular transport and chromosome segregation during cell division. Their instability stems from the low energy of tubulin dimer interactions, which sets the growing polymer close to its disassembly conditions. Microtubules function in coordination with kinesin and dynein molecular motors, which use ATP hydrolysis to produce mechanical work and move on microtubules. This raises the possibility that the forces produced by walking motors can break dimer interactions and trigger microtubule disassembly. We tested this hypothesis by studying the interplay between microtubules and moving molecular motors in vitro. Our results show that the mechanical work of molecular motors can remove tubulin dimers from the lattice and rapidly destroy microtubules. This effect was not observed when free tubulin dimers were present in the assay. Using fluorescently labelled tubulin dimers we found that dimer removal by motors was compensated for by the insertion of free tubulin dimers into the microtubule lattice. This self-repair mechanism allows microtubules to survive the damage induced by molecular motors as they move along their tracks. Our study reveals the existence of coupling between the motion of kinesin and dynein motors and the renewal of the microtubule lattice.</p>
