          <p>AbstractTrainees in medicine are taught to diagnose and administer treatment as needed; time-of-day is rarely considered. Yet accumulating evidence shows that ∼half of human genes and physiologic functions follow daily rhythms. Circadian medicine aims to incorporate knowledge of these rhythms to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Interest in this approach goes back at least six decades, but the path to the clinic has been marked by starts, stops, and ambiguity. How do we move the field forward to impact clinical practice? To gain insight into successful strategies, we studied the results of more than 100 human trials that evaluated time-of-administration of drugs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Evolutionary dynamics in structured populations under strong population genetic forces, bioRxiv, 2019-03-16</h4>
          <p>High rates of migration between subpopulations result in little population differentiation in the long-term neutral equilibrium. However, in the short-term, even very abundant migration may not be enough for subpopulations to equilibrate immediately. In this study, we investigate dynamical patterns of short-term population differentiation in adapting populations via stochastic and analytical modeling through time. We characterize a regime in which selection and migration interact to create non-monotonic patterns of the population differentiation statistic FST when migration is weaker than selection, but stronger than drift. We demonstrate how these patterns can be leveraged to estimate high migration rates that would lead to panmixia in the long term equilibrium using an approximate Bayesian computation approach. We apply this approach to estimate fast migration in a rapidly adapting intra-host Simian-HIV population sampled from different anatomical locations. Notably, we find differences in estimated migration rates between different compartments, all above  Nem = 1. This work demonstrates how studying demographic processes on the timescale of selective sweeps illuminates processes too fast to leave signatures on neutral timescales.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An open resource of structural variation for medical and population genetics, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYStructural variants (SVs) rearrange the linear and three-dimensional organization of the genome, which can have profound consequences in evolution, diversity, and disease. As national biobanks, human disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population references for small variants (i.e., SNVs &amp;amp; indels) in protein-coding genes, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. However, no comparable large-scale reference maps for SVs exist to date. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis, in the general population. The mutation rates and densities of SVs were non-uniform across chromosomes and SV classes. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reflect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. The average genome in gnomAD-SV harbored 8,202 SVs, and approximately eight genes altered by rare SVs. When incorporating these data with pLoF SNVs, we estimate that SVs comprise at least 25% of all rare pLoF events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼132 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental finding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted differences in frequencies across populations and confirmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants. In total, gnomAD-SV includes at least one CNV covering 57% of the genome, while the remaining 43% is significantly enriched for CNVs found in tumors and individuals with developmental disorders. However, current sample sizes remain markedly underpowered to establish estimates of SV constraint on the level of individual genes or noncoding loci. The gnomAD-SV resources have been integrated into the gnomAD browser (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&gt;httpsgnomad.broadinstitute.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), where users can freely explore this dataset without restrictions on reuse, which will have broad utility in population genetics, disease association, and diagnostic screening.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Changes in gene expression shift and switch genetic interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>SummaryAn important goal in disease genetics and evolutionary biology is to understand how mutations combine to alter phenotypes and fitness. Non-additive interactions between mutations occur extensively and change across conditions, cell types, and species, making genetic prediction a difficult challenge. To understand the reasons for this, we reduced the problem to a minimal system where we combined mutations in a single protein performing a single function (a transcriptional repressor inhibiting a target gene). Even in this minimal system, a change in gene expression altered both the strength and type of genetic interactions. These seemingly complicated changes could, however, be predicted by a mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype. We show that similar changes will be observed for many genes. These results provide fundamental insights into genotype-phenotype maps and illustrate how changes in genetic interactions can be predicted using hierarchical mechanistic models.One sentence SummaryDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor reveals that changes in gene expression will alter the strength and direction of genetic interactions between mutations in many genes.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Deep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor at two expression levels reveals extensive changes in mutational effects and genetic interactions&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Genetic interactions can switch from positive (suppressive) to negative (enhancing) as the expression of a gene changes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;A mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype accurately predicts changes in mutational effects and interactions&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Changes in expression will alter mutational effects and interactions for many genes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;For some genes, perfect mechanistic models will never be able to predict how mutations of known effect combine without measurements of intermediate phenotypes&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Enabling large-scale genome editing by reducing DNA nicking, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractTo extend the frontier of genome editing and enable the radical redesign of mammalian genomes, we developed a set of dead-Cas9 base editor (dBE) variants that allow editing at tens of thousands of loci per cell by overcoming the cell death associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs). We used a set of gRNAs targeting repetitive elements – ranging in target copy number from about 31 to 124,000 per cell. dBEs enabled survival after large-scale base editing, allowing targeted mutations at up to ~13,200 and ~2610 loci in 293T and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), respectively, three orders of magnitude greater than previously recorded. These dBEs can overcome current on-target mutation and toxicity barriers that prevent cell survival after large-scale genome engineering.One Sentence SummaryBase editing with reduced DNA nicking allows for the simultaneous editing of &amp;gt;10,000 loci in human cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The “sewing machine” for minimally invasive neural recording, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe present a system for scalable and customizable recording and stimulation of neural activity. In large animals and humans, the current benchmark for high spatial and temporal resolution neural interfaces are fixed arrays of wire or silicon electrodes inserted into the parenchyma of the brain. However, probes that are large and stiff enough to penetrate the brain have been shown to cause acute and chronic damage and inflammation, which limits their longevity, stability, and yield. One approach to this problem is to separate the requirements of the insertion device, which should to be as stiff as possible, with the implanted device, which should be as small and flexible as possible. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach with a system incorporating fine and flexible thin-film polymer probes, a fine and stiff insertion needle, and a robotic insertion machine. Together the system permits rapid and precise implantation of probes, each individually targeted to avoid observable vasculature and to attain diverse anatomical targets. As an initial demonstration of this system, we implanted arrays of electrodes in rat somatosensory cortex, recorded extracellular action potentials from them, and obtained histological images of the tissue response. This approach points the way toward a new generation of scaleable, stable, and safe neural interfaces, both for the basic scientific study of brain function and for clinical applications.</p>
