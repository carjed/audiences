          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Continuous addition of progenitors forms the cardiac ventricle in zebrafish, bioRxiv, 2017-12-08</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe vertebrate heart develops from several progenitor lineages. After early-differentiating first heart field (FHF) progenitors form the linear heart tube, late-differentiating second heart field (SHF) progenitors extend atrium, ventricle, and form the inflow and outflow tracts (IFTOFT). However, the position and migration of late-differentiating progenitors during heart formation remains unclear. Here, we tracked zebrafish heart development using transgenics based on the cardiopharyngeal transcription factor gene tbx1. Live-imaging uncovered a tbx1 reporter-expressing cell sheath that from anterior lateral plate mesoderm continuously disseminates towards the forming heart tube. High-speed imaging and optogenetic lineage tracing corroborated that the zebrafish ventricle forms through continuous addition from the undifferentiated progenitor sheath followed by late-phase accrual of the bulbus arteriosus (BA). FGF inhibition during sheath migration reduced ventricle size and abolished BA formation, refining the window of FGF action during OFT formation. Our findings consolidate previous end-point analyses and establish zebrafish ventricle formation as a continuous process.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Shared and distinct transcriptomic cell types across neocortical areas, bioRxiv, 2017-12-07</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTNeocortex contains a multitude of cell types segregated into layers and functionally distinct regions. To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the primary visual cortex (VISp), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) by deep single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic types were found in either VISp or ALM, with only three present in both. By combining single cell RNA-seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina expresses a conserved genetic program and distinct sets of secreted protein genes during infection of its two host plants, larch and poplar, bioRxiv, 2017-12-07</h4>
          <p>SummaryMechanims required for broad spectrum or specific host colonization of plant parasites are poorly understood. As a perfect illustration, heteroecious rust fungi require two alternate host plants to complete their life cycle. Melampsora larici-populina infects two taxonomically unrelated plants, larch on which sexual reproduction is achieved and poplar on which clonal multiplication occurs leading to severe epidemics in plantations. High-depth RNA sequencing was applied to three key developmental stages of M. larici-populina infection on larch basidia, pycnia and aecia. Comparative transcriptomics of infection on poplar and larch hosts was performed using available expression data. Secreted protein was the only significantly over-represented category among differentially expressed M. larici-populina genes in basidia, pycnia and aecia compared together, highlighting their probable involvement in the infection process. Comparison of fungal transcriptomes in larch and poplar revealed a majority of rust genes commonly expressed on the two hosts and a fraction exhibiting a host-specific expression. More particularly, gene families encoding small secreted proteins presented striking expression profiles that highlight probable candidate effectors specialized on each host. Our results bring valuable new information about the biological cycle of rust fungi and identify genes that may contribute to host specificity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Distinct descending motor cortex pathways and their roles in movement, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTActivity in motor cortex predicts specific movements, seconds before they are initiated. This preparatory activity has been observed in L5 descending ‘pyramidal tract’ (PT) neurons. A key question is how preparatory activity can be maintained without causing movement, and how preparatory activity is eventually converted to a motor command to trigger appropriate movements. We used single cell transcriptional profiling and axonal reconstructions to identify two types of PT neuron. Both types share projections to multiple targets in the basal ganglia and brainstem. One type projects to thalamic regions that connect back to motor cortex. In a delayed-response task, these neurons produced early preparatory activity that persisted until the movement. The second type projects to motor centers in the medulla and produced late preparatory activity and motor commands. These results indicate that two motor cortex output neurons are specialized for distinct roles in motor control.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Exponential fluorescent amplification of individual RNAs using clampFISH probes, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractNon-enzymatic, high-gain signal amplification methods with single-cell, single-molecule resolution are in great need. We present click-amplifying FISH (clampFISH) for the fluorescent detection of RNA that combines the specificity of oligonucleotides with bioorthogonal click chemistry in order to achieve high specificity and extremely high-gain (&amp;gt;400x) signal amplification. We show that clampFISH signal enables detection with low magnification microscopy and separation of cells by RNA levels via flow cytometry. Additionally, we show that the modular design of clampFISH probes enables multiplexing, that the locking mechanism prevents probe detachment in expansion microscopy, and that clampFISH works in tissue samples.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">k-mer grammar uncovers maize regulatory architecture, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTOnly a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this is an especially challenging problem. While regulatory regions are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be identified. We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing (1) “bag-of-words” which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built “bag-of-k-mers” and “vector-k-mers” models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an accuracy above 90%. Our “bag-of-k-mers” achieved higher overall accuracy, while the “vector-k-mers” models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy.</p>
