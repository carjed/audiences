          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Reduced signal for polygenic adaptation of height in UK Biobank, bioRxiv, 2018-06-25</h4>
          <p>AbstractSeveral recent papers have reported strong signals of selection on European polygenic height scores. These analyses used height effect estimates from the GIANT consortium and replication studies. Here, we describe a new analysis based on the the UK Biobank (UKB), a large, independent dataset. We find that the signals of selection using UKB effect-size estimates for height are strongly attenuated or absent. We also provide evidence that previous analyses were confounded by population stratification Therefore, the conclusion of strong polygenic adaptation now lacks support. Moreover, these discrepancies highlight (1) that methods for correcting for population stratification in GWAS may not always be sufficient for polygenic trait analyses, and (2) that claims of differences in polygenic scores between populations should be treated with caution until these issues are better understood.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Analysis and Correction of Inappropriate Image Duplication The Molecular and Cellular Biology Experience, bioRxiv, 2018-06-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe present study analyzed 960 papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) from 2009-2016 and found 59 (6.1%) to contain inappropriately duplicated images. The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication led to 42 corrections, 5 retractions and 12 instances in which no action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, ~10% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were retracted. If this proportion is representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are candidates for retraction due to image duplication. The resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper. MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5% out of 83) with image concerns in two months. The screening and correction of papers before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic images prior to publication, reduces post-publication problems and requires significantly less staff time than the correction of problems after publication.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Spatial Organization of Rho GTPase signaling by RhoGEFRhoGAP proteins, bioRxiv, 2018-06-24</h4>
          <p>AbstractRho GTPases control cell morphogenesis and thus fundamental processes in all eukaryotes. They are regulated by 145 RhoGEF and RhoGAP multi-domain proteins in humans. How the Rho signaling system is organized to generate localized responses in cells and prevent their spreading is not understood. Here, we systematically characterized the substrate specificities, localization and interactome of the RhoGEFsRhoGAPs and revealed their critical role in contextualizing and spatially delimiting Rho signaling. They localize to multiple compartments providing positional information, are extensively interconnected to jointly coordinate their signaling networks and are widely autoinhibited to remain sensitive to local activation. RhoGAPs exhibit lower substrate specificity than RhoGEFs and may contribute to preserving Rho activity gradients. Our approach led us to uncover a multi-RhoGEF complex downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors controlling a Cdc42RhoA crosstalk. The spatial organization of Rho signaling thus differs from other small GTPases and expands the repertoire of mechanisms governing localized signaling activity.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DoubletFinder Doublet detection in single-cell RNA sequencing data using artificial nearest neighbors, bioRxiv, 2018-06-20</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using droplet microfluidics occasionally produces transcriptome data representing more than one cell. These technical artifacts are caused by cell doublets formed during cell capture and occur at a frequency proportional to the total number of sequenced cells. The presence of doublets can lead to spurious biological conclusions, which justifies the practice of sequencing fewer cells to limit doublet formation rates. Here, we present a computational doublet detection tool – DoubletFinder – that identifies doublets based solely on gene expression features. DoubletFinder infers the putative gene expression profile of real doublets by generating artificial doublets from existing scRNA-seq data. Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches. We anticipate that DoubletFinder will aid in scRNA-seq data analysis and will increase the throughput and accuracy of scRNA-seq experiments.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Measuring narrative engagement The heart tells the story, bioRxiv, 2018-06-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractStories play a fundamental role in human culture. They provide a mechanism for sharing cultural identity, imparting knowledge, revealing beliefs, reinforcing social bonds and providing entertainment that is central to all human societies. Here we investigated the extent to which the delivery medium of a story (audio or visual) affected conscious and subconscious engagement with the narrative. Although participants self-reported greater involvement for watching video relative to listening to auditory scenes, stronger physiological responses were recorded for auditory stories. Sensors placed at their wrists showed higher and more variable heart rates, greater electrodermal activity, and even higher body temperatures. We interpret these findings as physiological evidence that the stories were more cognitively and emotionally engaging when presented in an auditory format. This may be because listening to a story, rather than watching a video, is a more active process of co-creation, and that this imaginative process in the listener’s mind is detectable on the skin at their wrist.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Robust genome editing with short single-stranded and long, partially single-stranded DNA donors in C. elegans, bioRxiv, 2018-06-20</h4>
          <p>AbstractCRISPR-based genome editing using ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and synthetic single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) donors can be highly effective. However, reproducibility can vary, and precise, targeted integration of longer constructs – such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) tags remains challenging in many systems. Here we describe a streamlined and optimized editing protocol for the nematode C. elegans. We demonstrate its efficacy, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness by affinity-tagging all twelve of the Worm-specific Argonaute (WAGO) proteins in C. elegans using ssODN donors. In addition, we describe a novel PCR-based partially single-stranded “hybrid” donor design that yields high efficiency editing with large (kilobase-scale) constructs. We use these hybrid donors to introduce fluorescent protein tags into multiple loci achieving editing efficiencies that approach those previously obtained only with much shorter ssODN donors. The principals and strategies described here are likely to translate to other systems and should allow researchers to reproducibly and efficiently obtain both long and short precision genome edits.</p>
