          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Determining cellular CTCF and cohesin abundances to constrain 3D genome models, bioRxiv, 2018-07-18</h4>
          <p>Achieving a quantitative and predictive understanding of 3D genome architecture remains a major challenge, as it requires quantitative measurements of the key proteins involved. Here we report the quantification of CTCF and cohesin, two causal regulators of topological associating domains (TADs) in mammalian cells. Extending our previous imaging studies (Hansen 2017), we estimate bounds on the density of putatively DNA loop-extruding cohesin complexes and CTCF binding site occupancy. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies of an endogenously tagged subunit (Rad21) suggest the presence of cohesin dimers andor oligomers. Finally, based on our cell lines with accurately measured protein abundances, we report a method to conveniently determine the number of molecules of any Halo-tagged protein in the cell. We anticipate that our results and the established tool for measuring cellular protein abundances will advance a more quantitative understanding of 3D genome organization, and facilitate protein quantification, key for understanding diverse biological processes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Entomophthovirus An insect-derived iflavirus that infects a behavior manipulating fungal pathogen of dipterans, bioRxiv, 2018-07-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe discovered a virus infecting Entomophthora muscae, a behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen of dipterans. The virus, which we name Entomophthovirus, is a capsid-forming, positive-strand RNA virus in the viral family iflaviridae, whose known members almost exclusively infect insects. We show that the virus RNA is expressed at high levels in fungal cells in vitro and during in vivo infections of Drosophila melanogaster, and that virus particles are present in E. muscae. Two close relatives of the virus had been previously described as insect viruses based on the presence of viral genomes in transcriptomes assembled from RNA extracted from wild dipterans. By analyzing sequencing data from these earlier reports, we show that both dipteran samples were co-infected with E. muscae. We also find the virus in RNA sequencing data from samples of two other species of dipterans, Musca domestica and Delia radicum, known to be infected with E. muscae. These data establish that Entomophthovirus is widely, and seemingly obligately, associated with E. muscae. As other members of the iflaviridae cause behavioral changes in insects, we speculate on the possibility that Entomophthovirus plays a role in E. muscae involved host manipulation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Panoramic stitching of heterogeneous single-cell transcriptomic data, bioRxiv, 2018-07-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractResearchers are generating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles of diverse biological systems1–4 and every cell type in the human body.5 Leveraging this data to gain unprecedented insight into biology and disease will require assembling heterogeneous cell populations across multiple experiments, laboratories, and technologies. Although methods for scRNA-seq data integration exist6,7, they often naively merge data sets together even when the data sets have no cell types in common, leading to results that do not correspond to real biological patterns. Here we present Scanorama, inspired by algorithms for panorama stitching, that overcomes the limitations of existing methods to enable accurate, heterogeneous scRNA-seq data set integration. Our strategy identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of data sets and is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques. We use Scanorama to combine 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments across 9 different technologies into a single comprehensive reference, demonstrating how Scanorama can be used to obtain a more complete picture of cellular function across a wide range of scRNA-seq experiments.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The high abortion cost of human reproduction, bioRxiv, 2018-07-18</h4>
          <p>Information from many large data bases and published studies was integrated to estimate the age-specific spontaneous abortion rate in an economically-developed human population. Accuracy was tested with published data from a diverse array of studies. Spontaneous abortion was found to be i) the predominant outcome of fertilization and ii) a natural and inevitable part of human reproduction at all ages. The decision to reproduce is inextricably coupled with the production of spontaneous abortions with high probability, and the decision to have a large family leads to many spontaneous abortions with virtual certainty. The lifetime number of spontaneous abortions was estimated for a “canonical” woman (constrained to have average age at marriage, first birth, inter-birth intervals, and family size) in two populations one with and the other without effective birth control (including free access to elective abortions). Birth control was found to reduce lifetime abortions more than 6-fold.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Speed breeding in growth chambers and glasshouses for crop breeding and model plant research, bioRxiv, 2018-07-16</h4>
          <p>1.AbstractTo meet the challenge of feeding a growing population, breeders and scientists are continuously looking for ways to increase genetic gain in crop breeding. One way this can be achieved is through “speed breeding” (SB), which shortens the breeding cycle and accelerates research studies through rapid generation advancement. The SB method can be carried out in a number of ways, one of which involves extending the duration of a plant’s daily exposure to light (photoperiod) combined with early seed harvest in order to cycle quickly from seed to seed, thereby reducing the generation times for some long-day (LD) or day-neutral crops. Here we present glasshouse and growth chamber-based SB protocols with supporting data from experimentation with several crop species. These protocols describe the growing conditions, including soil media composition, lighting, temperature and spacing, which promote rapid growth of spring and winter bread wheat, durum wheat, barley, oat, various members of the Brassica family, chickpea, pea, grasspea, quinoa and the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Points of flexibility within the protocols are highlighted, including how plant density can be increased to efficiently scale-up plant numbers for single seed descent (SSD) purposes. Conversely, instructions on how to perform SB on a small-scale by creating a benchtop SB growth cabinet that enables optimization of parameters at a low cost are provided. We also outline the procedure for harvesting and germinating premature wheat, barley and pea seed to reduce generation time. Finally, we provide troubleshooting suggestions to avoid potential pitfalls.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genetic Diversity Patterns and Domestication Origin of Soybean, bioRxiv, 2018-07-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding diversity and evolution of a crop is an essential step to implement a strategy to expand its germplasm base for crop improvement research. Samples intensively collected from Korea, which is a small but central region in the distribution geography of soybean, were genotyped to provide sufficient data to underpin genome-wide population genetic questions. After removing natural hybrids and duplicated or redundant accessions, we obtained a non-redundant set comprising 1,957 domesticated and 1,079 wild accessions to perform population structure analyses. Our analysis demonstrates that while wild soybean germplasm will require additional sampling from diverse indigenous areas to expand the germplasm base, the current domesticated soybean germplasm is saturated in terms of genetic diversity. We then showed that our genome-wide polymorphism map enabled us to detect genetic loci underling flower color, seed-coat color, and domestication syndrome. A representative soybean set consisting of 194 accessions were divided into one domesticated subpopulation and four wild subpopulations that could be traced back to their geographic collection areas. Population genomics analyses suggested that the monophyletic group of domesticated soybeans was originated in eastern Japan. The results were further substantiated by a phylogenetic tree constructed from domestication-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms identified in this study.</p>
