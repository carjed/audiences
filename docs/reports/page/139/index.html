          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">In vivo structure of the Legionella type II secretion system by electron cryotomography Supplementary material, bioRxiv, 2019-01-19</h4>
          <p>The type II secretion system (T2SS) is a multi-protein envelope-spanning assembly that translocates a wide range of virulence factors, enzymes and effectors through the outer membrane (OM) of many Gram-negative bacteria. Here, using electron cryotomography and subtomogram averaging methods, we present the first in situ structure of an intact T2SS, imaged within the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila. Although the T2SS has only limited sequence and component homology with the evolutionarily-related Type IV pilus (T4P) system, we show that their overall architectures are remarkably similar. Despite similarities, there are also differences, including for instance that the T2SS-ATPase complex is usually present but disengaged from the inner membrane, the T2SS has a much longer periplasmic vestibule, and it has a short-lived flexible pseudopilus. Placing atomic models of the components into our ECT map produced a complete architectural model of the intact T2SS that provides new insights into the structure and function of its components, its position within the cell envelope, and the interactions between its different subcomplexes. Overall, these structural results strongly support the piston model for substrate extrusion.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Direct synthesis of EM-visible gold nanoparticles on genetically encoded tags for single-molecule visualization in cells, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18</h4>
          <p>Single-molecule visualization in cells with genetically encoded tags for electron microscopy (EM) has been a long-awaited but unimplemented tool for cell biologists. Here, we report an approach for directly synthesizing EM-visible gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on cysteine-rich tags for single-molecule visualization in cells. We first uncovered an auto-nucleation suppression mechanism that allows specific synthesis of AuNPs on isolated cysteine-rich tags. We next exploited this mechanism to develop an approach for single-molecule detection of proteins in prokaryotic cells and achieved an unprecedented labeling efficiency. We then expanded it to more complicated eukaryotic cells and successfully detected the proteins targeted to various organelles, including the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope, ER lumen, nuclear pores, spindle pole bodies, and mitochondrial matrix. Thus, our implementation of genetically encoded tags for EM should allow cell biologists to address an enormous range of biological questions at single-molecule level in diverse cellular ultrastructural contexts without using antibodies.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Organization and Regulation of Chromatin by Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18</h4>
          <p>Genomic DNA is highly compacted in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells as a nucleoprotein assembly called chromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, where ~146 base pair increments of the genome are wrapped and compacted around the core histone proteins. Further genomic organization and compaction occur through higher order assembly of nucleosomes. This organization regulates many nuclear processes, and is controlled in part by histone post-transtranslational modifications and chromatin-binding proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the assembly and compaction of the genome remain unclear. Here we show that in the presence of physiologic concentrations of mono- and divalent salts, histone tail-driven interactions drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of nucleosome arrays, resulting in substantial condensation. Phase separation of nucleosomal arrays is inhibited by histone acetylation, whereas histone H1 promotes phase separation, further compaction, and decreased dynamics within droplets, mirroring the relationship between these modulators and the accessibility of the genome in cells. These results indicate that under physiologically relevant conditions, LLPS is an intrinsic behavior of the chromatin polymer, and suggest a model in which the condensed phase reflects a genomic &#39;ground state&#39; that can produce chromatin organization and compaction in vivo. The dynamic nature of this state could enable known modulators of chromatin structure, such as post-translational modifications and chromatin binding proteins, to act upon it and consequently control nuclear processes such as transcription and DNA repair. Our data suggest an important role for LLPS of chromatin in the organization of the eukaryotic genome.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Transposable elements drive reorganisation of 3D chromatin during early embryogenesis, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18</h4>
          <p>Transposable elements are abundant genetic components of eukaryotic genomes with important regulatory features affecting transcription, splicing, and recombination, among others. Here we demonstrate that the Murine Endogenous Retroviral Element (MuERV-LMERVL) family of transposable elements drives the 3D reorganisation of the genome in the early mouse embryo. By generating Hi-C data in 2-cell-like cells, we show that MERLV elements promote the formation of insulating domain boundaries throughout the genome in vivo and in vitro. The formation of these boundaries is coupled to the upregulation of directional transcription from MERVL, which results in the activation of a subset of the gene expression programme of the 2-cell stage embryo. Domain boundaries in the 2-cell stage embryo are transient and can be remodelled without undergoing cell division. Remarkably, we find extensive inter-strain MERVL variation, suggesting multiple non-overlapping rounds of recent genome invasion and a high regulatory plasticity of genome organisation. Our results demonstrate that MERVL drive chromatin organisation during early embryonic development shedding light into how nuclear organisation emerges during zygotic genome activation in mammals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A 3D-printed hand-powered centrifuge for molecular biology Supplementary Information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-17</h4>
          <p>The centrifuge is an essential tool for many aspects of research and medical diagnostics. However, conventional centrifuges are often inaccessible outside of conventional laboratory settings, such as remote field sites, require a constant external power source, and can be prohibitively costly in resource-limited settings and STEM-focused programs. Here we present the 3D-Fuge, a 3D-printed hand-powered centrifuge, as a novel alternative to standard benchtop centrifuges. Based on the design principles of a paper-based centrifuge, this 3D-printed instrument increases the volume capacity to 2 mL and can reach hand-powered centrifugation speeds up to 6,000 rpm. The 3D-Fuge devices presented here are capable of centrifugation of a wide variety of different solutions such as spinning down samples for biomarker applications and performing  nucleotide extractions as part of a portable molecular lab setup. We introduce the design and proof-of-principle trials that demonstrate the utility of low-cost 3D printed centrifuges for use in remote and educational settings.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A DNA-based voltmeter for organelles Supplementary information, bioRxiv, 2019-01-17</h4>
          <p>The role of membrane potential in most intracellular organelles remains unexplored because of the lack of suitable probes. We describe a DNA-based fluorescent reporter that quantitates membrane potential and can be targeted to specific organelles in live cells. It is equipped with a voltage sensitive fluorophore, a reference fluorophore for ratiometric quantification, and acts as an endocytic tracer. We could thereby measure the membrane potential of different intracellular organelles in living cells, which has not been possible previously. Our understanding of how membrane potential regulates organelle biology is poised to expand through the use of these new sensors.</p>
