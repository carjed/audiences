          <p>Introductory ParagraphSurveillance of circulating drug resistant bacteria is essential for healthcare providers to deliver effective empiric antibiotic therapy. However, the results of surveillance may not be available on a timescale that is optimal for guiding patient treatment. Here we present a method for inferring characteristics of an unknown bacterial sample by identifying the presence of sequence variation across the genome that is linked to a phenotype of interest, in this case drug resistance. We demonstrate an implementation of this principle using sequence k-mer content, matched to a database of known genomes. We show this technique can be applied to data from an Oxford Nanopore device in real time and is capable of identifying the presence of a known resistant strain in 5 minutes, even from a complex metagenomic sample. This flexible approach has wide application to pathogen surveillance and may be used to greatly accelerate diagnoses of resistant infections.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution, bioRxiv, 2018-08-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractTargeted PCR amplification and high-throughput sequencing (amplicon sequencing) of 16S rRNA gene fragments is widely used to profile microbial communities. New long-read sequencing technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher error rates have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution and a near-zero error rate.In two artificial communities of known composition, our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members without residual errors. The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by our approach allowed E. coli strains to be correctly classified to the O157H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in several E. coli strains.There are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modified penetrance of coding variants by cis-regulatory variation contributes to disease risk, Nature Genetics, 2018-08-10</h4>
          <p>Coding variants represent many of the strongest associations between genotype and phenotype; however, they exhibit inter-individual differences in effect, termed ‘variable penetrance’. Here, we study how cis-regulatory variation modifies the penetrance of coding variants. Using functional genomic and genetic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), we observed that in the general population, purifying selection has depleted haplotype combinations predicted to increase pathogenic coding variant penetrance. Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPRCas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout. Our results demonstrate that joint regulatory and coding variant effects are an important part of the genetic architecture of human traits and contribute to modified penetrance of disease-causing variants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapid Diagnosis of Lower Respiratory Infection using Nanopore-based Clinical Metagenomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractLower respiratory infections (LRIs) accounted for three million deaths worldwide in 2016, the leading infectious cause of mortality. The “gold standard” for investigation of bacterial LRIs is culture, which has poor sensitivity and is too slow to guide early antibiotic therapy. Metagenomic sequencing potentially could replace culture, providing rapid, sensitive and comprehensive results. We developed a metagenomics pipeline for the investigation of bacterial LRIs using saponin-based host DNA depletion combined with rapid nanopore sequencing. The first iteration of the pipeline was tested on respiratory samples from 40 patients. It was then refined to reduce turnaround and increase sensitivity, before testing a further 41 samples. The refined method was 96.6% concordant with culture for detection of pathogens and could accurately detect resistance genes with a turnaround time of six hours. This study demonstrates that nanopore metagenomics can rapidly and accurately characterise bacterial LRIs when combined with efficient human DNA depletion.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-06</h4>
          <p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.</p>
