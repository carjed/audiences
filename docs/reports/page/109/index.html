          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Absence of entourage Terpenoids commonly found in Cannabis sativa do not modulate the functional activity of Δ9-THC at human CB1and CB2 receptors, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractIntroductionCompounds present in Cannabis sativa such as phytocannabinoids and terpenoids, may act in concert to elicit therapeutic effects. Cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) directly activate cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), however, it is not known if terpenoids present in Cannabis also affect cannabinoid receptor signalling. Therefore, we examined 6 common terpenoids alone, and in combination with cannabinoid receptor agonists, on CB1 and CB2 signalling in vitro.Materials and MethodsPotassium channel activity in AtT20 FlpIn cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptors was measured in real-time using FLIPR® membrane potential dye in a FlexStation 3 plate reader. Terpenoids were tested individually and in combination for periods up to 30 minutes. Endogenous somatostatin receptors served as a control for direct effects of drugs on potassium channels.Resultsα-Pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, linalool, limonene and β-myrcene (up to 30-100 µM) did not change membrane potential in AtT20 cells expressing CB1 or CB2, or affect the response to a maximally effective concentration of the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940. The presence of individual or a combination of terpenoids did not affect the hyperpolarization produced by Δ9-THC (10µM) (CB1 control, 59±7%; with terpenoids (10 µM each) 55±4%; CB2 Δ9-THC 16±5%, with terpenoids (10 µM each) 17±4%). To investigate possible effect on desensitization of CB1 responses, all six terpenoids were added together with Δ9-THC and signalling measured continuously over 30 min. Terpenoids did not affect desensitization, after 30 minutes the control hyperpolarization recovered by 63±6%, in the presence of the terpenoids recovery was 61±5%.DiscussionNone of the six of the most common terpenoids in Cannabis directly activated CB1 or CB2, or modulated the signalling of the phytocannabinoid agonist Δ9-THC. These results suggest that if a phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effect exists, it is not at the CB1 or CB2 receptor level. It remains possible that terpenoids activate CB1 and CB2 signalling pathways that do not involve potassium channels, however, it seems more likely that they may act at different molecular target(s) in the neuronal circuits important for the behavioural effect of Cannabis.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clustering co-abundant genes identifies components of the gut microbiome that are reproducibly associated with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health. By proposing a new computational approach for handling high dimensional metagenomics data, we identified specific microbial gene groups that are associated with disease that can be used to identify strains of interest for further preclinical and mechanistic experimentation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Functional metagenomics-guided discovery of potent Cas9 inhibitors in the human microbiome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>AbstractCRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria and archaea from phages and other mobile genetic elements, which use small anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to overcome CRISPR-Cas immunity. Because they are difficult to identify, the natural diversity and impact of Acrs on microbial ecosystems is underappreciated. To overcome this discovery bottleneck, we developed a high-throughput functional selection that isolates acr genes based on their ability to inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. Using this selection, we discovered ten DNA fragments from human oral and fecal metagenomes that antagonize Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9). The most potent acr discovered, acrIIA11, was recovered from a Lachnospiraceae phage and is among the strongest known SpyCas9 inhibitors. AcrIIA11 homologs are distributed across multiple bacterial phyla and many divergent homologs inhibit SpyCas9. We show that AcrIIA11 antagonizes SpyCas9 using a different mechanism than that of previously characterized inhibitors. Our study highlights the power of functional selections to uncover widespread Cas9 inhibitors within diverse microbiomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Trichoplax microbiome the simplest animal lives in an intimate symbiosis with two intracellular bacteria, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06</h4>
          <p>Summary paragraphPlacozoa is an enigmatic phylum of simple, microscopic, marine metazoans. Although intracellular bacteria have been found in all members of this phylum, almost nothing is known about their identity, location and interactions with their host. We used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of single host individuals, plus metaproteomic and imaging analyses, to show that the placozoan Trichoplax H2 lives in symbiosis with two intracellular bacteria. One symbiont forms a new genus in the Midichloriaceae (Rickettsiales) and has a genomic repertoire similar to that of rickettsial parasites, but does not appear to express key genes for energy parasitism. Correlative microscopy and 3-D electron tomography revealed that this symbiont resides in an unusual location, the rough endoplasmic reticulum of its host’s internal fiber cells. The second symbiont belongs to the Margulisbacteria, a phylum without cultured representatives and not known to form intracellular associations. This symbiont lives in the ventral epithelial cells of Trichoplax, likely metabolizes algal lipids digested by its host, and has the capacity to supplement the placozoan’s nutrition. Our study shows that even the simplest animals known have evolved highly specific and intimate associations with symbiotic, intracellular bacteria, and highlights that symbioses with microorganisms are a basal trait of animal life.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A robust and efficient method for Mendelian randomization with hundreds of genetic variants unravelling mechanisms linking HDL-cholesterol and coronary heart disease, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05</h4>
          <p>Mendelian randomization (MR) investigations with large numbers of genetic variants are becoming increasingly common. However, the reliability of findings from a MR investigation is dependent on the validity of the genetic variants as instrumental variables. We developed a method to identify groups of genetic variants with similar causal effect estimates, which may represent distinct mechanisms by which the risk factor influences the outcome. Our contamination mixture method is a robust and efficient method for valid MR in the presence of invalid IVs. Compared to other robust methods, our method had the lowest mean squared error across a range of realistic scenarios. The method is fast and efficient, and can perform analysis with hundreds of variants in a fraction of a second. In a MR analysis for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, the method identified 11 variants associated with increased HDL-cholesterol, decreased triglyceride levels, and decreased CHD risk that had the same directions of associations with platelet distribution width and other blood cell traits, suggesting a shared mechanism linking lipids and CHD risk relating to platelet aggregation.</p>
