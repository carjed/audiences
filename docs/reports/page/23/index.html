          <p>AbstractTranscriptome data holds substantial promise for better interpretation of rare genetic variants in basic research and clinical settings. Here, we introduce ANalysis of Expression VAriation (ANEVA) to quantify genetic variation in gene dosage from allelic expression (AE) data in a population. Application to GTEx data showed that this variance estimate is robust across datasets and is correlated with selective constraint in a gene. We next used ANEVA variance estimates in a Dosage Outlier Test (ANEVA-DOT) to identify genes in an individual that are affected by a rare regulatory variant with an unusually strong effect. Applying ANEVA-DOT to AE data form 70 Mendelian muscular disease patients showed high accuracy in detecting genes with pathogenic variants in previously resolved cases, and lead to one confirmed and several potential new diagnoses in cases previously unresolved. Using our reference estimates from GTEx data, ANEVA-DOT can be readily incorporated in rare disease diagnostic pipelines to better utilize RNA-seq data.One Sentence SummaryNew statistical framework for modelling allelic expression characterizes genetic regulatory variation in populations and informs diagnosis in rare disease patients</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Shake-it-off A simple ultrasonic cryo-EM specimen preparation device, bioRxiv, 2019-05-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractAlthough microscopes and image analysis software for electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) have improved dramatically in recent years, specimen preparation methods have lagged behind. Most strategies still rely on blotting microscope grids with paper to produce a thin film of solution suitable for vitrification. This approach loses more than 99.9% of the applied sample and requires several seconds, leading to problematic air-water interface interactions for macromolecules in the resulting thin film of solution and complicating time-resolved studies. Recently developed self-wicking EM grids allow use of small volumes of sample, with nanowires on the grid bars removing excess solution to produce a thin film within tens of milliseconds from sample application to freezing. Here we present a simple cryo-EM specimen preparation device that uses components from an ultrasonic humidifier to transfer protein solution onto a self-wicking EM grid. The device is controlled by a Raspberry Pi single board computer and all components are either widely available or can be manufactured by online services, allowing the device to be constructed in laboratories that specialize in cryo-EM, rather than instrument design. The simple open-source design permits straightforward customization of the instrument for specialized experiments.SynopsisA method is presented for high-speed low-volume cryo-EM specimen preparation with a device constructed from readily available components.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Stress-driven transposable element de-repression dynamics in a fungal pathogen, bioRxiv, 2019-05-10</h4>
          <p>AbstractTransposable elements (TEs) are drivers of genome evolution and affect the expression landscape of the host genome. Stress is a major factor inducing TE activity, however the regulatory mechanisms underlying de-repression are poorly understood. Key unresolved questions are whether different types of stress differentially induce TE activity and whether different TEs respond differently to the same stress. Plant pathogens are excellent models to dissect the impact of stress on TEs, because lifestyle transitions on and off the host impose exposure to a variety of stress conditions. We analyzed the TE expression landscape of four well-characterized strains of the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We experimentally exposed strains to nutrient starvation and host infection stress. Contrary to expectations, we show that the two distinct conditions induce the expression of different sets of TEs. In particular, the most highly expressed TEs, including MITE and LTR-Gypsy elements, show highly distinct de-repression across stress conditions. Both the genomic context of TEs and the genetic background stress (i.e. different strains harboring the same TEs) were major predictors of de-repression dynamics under stress. Genomic defenses inducing point mutations in repetitive regions were largely ineffective to prevent TE de-repression. Consistent with TE de-repression being governed by epigenetic effects, we found that gene expression profiles under stress varied significantly depending on the proximity to the closest TEs. The unexpected complexity in TE responsiveness to stress across genetic backgrounds and genomic locations shows that species harbor substantial genetic variation to control TEs.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Systematic comparative analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing methods, bioRxiv, 2019-05-10</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTA multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts. However, these methods have not been systematically and comprehensively benchmarked. Here, we directly compare seven methods for single cell andor single nucleus profiling from three types of samples – cell lines, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain tissue – generating 36 libraries in six separate experiments in a single center. To analyze these datasets, we developed and applied scumi, a flexible computational pipeline that can be used for any scRNA-seq method. We evaluated the methods for both basic performance and for their ability to recover known biological information in the samples. Our study will help guide experiments with the methods in this study as well as serve as a benchmark for future studies and for computational algorithm development.</p>

          <p>AbstractRecent developments in stem cell biology have enabled the study of cell fate decisions in early human development that are impossible to study in vivo. However, understanding how development varies across individuals and, in particular, the influence of common genetic variants during this process has not been characterised. Here, we exploit human iPS cell lines from 125 donors, a pooled experimental design, and single-cell RNA-sequencing to study population variation of endoderm differentiation. We identify molecular markers that are predictive of differentiation efficiency, and utilise heterogeneity in the genetic background across individuals to map hundreds of expression quantitative trait loci that influence expression dynamically during differentiation and across cellular contexts.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Variable prediction accuracy of polygenic scores within an ancestry group, bioRxiv, 2019-05-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractFields as diverse as human genetics and sociology are increasingly using polygenic scores based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for phenotypic prediction. However, recent work has shown that polygenic scores have limited portability across groups of different genetic ancestries, restricting the contexts in which they can be used reliably and potentially creating serious inequities in future clinical applications. Using the UK Biobank data, we demonstrate that even within a single ancestry group, the prediction accuracy of polygenic scores depends on characteristics such as the age or sex composition of the individuals in which the GWAS and the prediction were conducted, and on the GWAS study design. Our findings highlight both the complexities of interpreting polygenic scores and underappreciated obstacles to their broad use.</p>
