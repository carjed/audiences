          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Interpretation of biological experiments changes with evolution of Gene Ontology and its annotations, bioRxiv, 2017-12-04</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTGene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is ubiquitously used for interpreting high throughput molecular data and generating hypotheses about underlying biological phenomena of experiments. However, the two building blocks of this analysis — the ontology and the annotations — evolve rapidly. We used gene signatures derived from 104 disease analyses to systematically evaluate how enrichment analysis results were affected by evolution of the GO over a decade. We found low consistency between enrichment analyses results obtained with early and more recent GO versions. Furthermore, there continues to be strong annotation bias in the GO annotations where 58% of the annotations are for 16% of the human genes. Our analysis suggests that GO evolution may have affected the interpretation and possibly reproducibility of experiments over time. Hence, researchers must exercise caution when interpreting GO enrichment analyses and should reexamine previous analyses with the most recent GO version.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phylogenomics places orphan protistan lineages in a novel eukaryotic super-group, bioRxiv, 2017-12-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent phylogenetic analyses position certain ‘orphan’ protist lineages deep in the tree of eukaryotic life, but their exact placements are poorly resolved. We conducted phylogenomic analyses that incorporate deeply sequenced transcriptomes from representatives of collodictyonids (diphylleids), rigifilids, Mantamonas and ancyromonads (planomonads). Analyses of 351 genes, using site-heterogeneous mixture models, strongly support a novel supergroup-level clade that includes collodictyonids, rigifilids and Mantamonas, which we name ‘CRuMs’. Further, they robustly place CRuMs as the closest branch to Amorphea (including animals and fungi). Ancyromonads are strongly inferred to be more distantly related to Amorphea than are CRuMs. They emerge either as sister to malawimonads, or as a separate deeper branch. CRuMs and ancyromonads represent two distinct major groups that branch deeply on the lineage that includes animals, near the most commonly inferred root of the eukaryote tree. This makes both groups crucial in examinations of the deepest-level history of extant eukaryotes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Model-based detection and analysis of introgressed Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, bioRxiv, 2017-12-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenetic evidence has revealed that the ancestors of modern human populations outside of Africa and their hominin sister groups, notably the Neanderthals, exchanged genetic material in the past. The distribution of these introgressed sequence-tracts along modern-day human genomes provides insight into the ancient structure and migration patterns of these archaic populations. Furthermore, it facilitates studying the selective processes that lead to the accumulation or depletion of introgressed genetic variation. Recent studies have developed methods to localize these introgressed regions, reporting long regions that are depleted of Neanderthal introgression and enriched in genes, suggesting negative selection against the Neanderthal variants. On the other hand, enriched Neanderthal ancestry in hair- and skin-related genes suggests that some introgressed variants facilitated adaptation to new environments. Here, we present a model-based method called diCal-admix and apply it to detect tracts of Neanderthal introgression in modern humans. We demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy through extensive simulations. We use our method to detect introgressed regions in modern human individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project, using a high coverage genome from a Neanderthal individual from the Altai mountains as reference. Our introgression detection results and findings concerning their functional implications are largely concordant with previous studies, and are consistent with weak selection against Neanderthal ancestry. We find some evidence that selection against Neanderthal ancestry was due to higher genetic load in Neanderthals, resulting from small effective population size, rather than Dobzhansky-Müller incompatibilities. Finally, we investigate the role of the X-chromosome in the divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Oxford Nanopore sequencing in a research-based undergraduate course, bioRxiv, 2017-12-01</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundNanopore sequencing is a third generation genomic sequencing method that offers real time sequencing of DNA samples. Nanopore sequencing is an excellent tool for teaching because it involves cutting-edge sequencing methods and also helps students to develop a research mindset, where students can learn to identify and resolve problems that arise during an experiment.ResultsWe, as a group of undergraduate biology students, were able to use nanopore sequencing to analyze a sample of pupfish DNA. We were able to accomplish this without computer science backgrounds and only some basic DNA extraction training. Although there were issues, such as inconsistent results across runs, we found it useful as a research learning experience and an application of the skills we learned.ConclusionsAs students, it was exciting to be able to experience this technology first hand and apply what we learned in the classroom. Nanopore sequencing holds potential for DNA sequencing of large fragments in real time. It allows students to be acquainted with novel technologies and the theories behind them. However, as with all new techniques, it does not have the same established support, and when students run into difficulties while using nanopore sequencing, it is often difficult to identify what went wrong.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Partially redundant actin genes in Chlamydomonas control flagellum-directed traffic and transition zone organization, bioRxiv, 2017-12-01</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTFlagella of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are nearly identical to cilia of mammalian cells and provide an excellent model to study ciliogenesis. These biflagellated cells have two actin genes one encoding a conventional actin (IDA5) and the other encoding a divergent novel actin-like protein (NAP1). Previously, we described a role for actin in the regulation of flagella-building intraflagellar transport machinery. Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to this process using a nap1 mutant Chlamydomonas strain. Disruption of a single actin allows normal or slower incorporation but complete flagellar assembly. However, when we disrupt both actins using Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins is actin-dependent. Upon total actin disruption during flagellar assembly, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles, suggesting impaired vesicular trafficking may be the mechanism by which actin supports flagellar growth from new flagellar proteins. We also find there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Extended (2 hour) treatment with LatB, a condition under which NAP1 is upregulated, restores NPHP-4 localization. This suggests NAP1 can perform the functions of conventional actin at the transition zone. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Biomolecular simulations under realistic macroscopic salt conditions, bioRxiv, 2017-11-30</h4>
          <p>Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an (Δ𝜇, 𝑁, 𝑝, 𝑇) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.</p>
