          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Octopi Open configurable high-throughput imaging platform for infectious disease diagnosis in the field, bioRxiv, 2019-06-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractAccess to quantitative, robust, yet affordable diagnostic tools is necessary to reduce global infectious disease burden. Manual microscopy has served as a bedrock for diagnostics with wide adaptability, although at a cost of tedious labor and human errors. Automated robotic microscopes are poised to enable a new era of smart field microscopy but current platforms remain cost prohibitive and largely inflexible, especially for resource poor and field settings. Here we present Octopi, a low-cost ($250-$500) and reconfigurable autonomous microscopy platform capable of automated slide scanning and correlated bright-field and fluorescence imaging. Being highly modular, it also provides a framework for new disease-specific modules to be developed. We demonstrate the power of the platform by applying it to automated detection of malaria parasites in blood smears. Specifically, we discovered a spectral shift on the order of 10 nm for DAPI-stained Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. This shift allowed us to detect the parasites with a low magnification (equivalent to 10x) large field of view (2.56 mm2) module. Combined with automated slide scanning, real time computer vision and machine learning-based classification, Octopi is able to screen more than 1.5 million red blood cells per minute for parasitemia quantification, with estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90% at parasitemia of 50ul and 100% for parasitemia higher than 150l. With different modules, we further showed imaging of tissue slice and sputum sample on the platform. With roughly two orders of magnitude in cost reduction, Octopi opens up the possibility of a large robotic microscope network for improved disease diagnosis while providing an avenue for collective efforts for development of modular instruments.One sentence summaryWe developed a low-cost ($250-$500) automated imaging platform that can quantify malaria parasitemia by scanning 1.5 million red blood cells per minute.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">RADICL-seq identifies general and cell type-specific principles of genome-wide RNA-chromatin interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-06-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractMammalian genomes encode tens of thousands of noncoding RNAs. Most noncoding transcripts exhibit nuclear localization and several have been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin remodelling. To investigate the function of such RNAs, methods to massively map the genomic interacting sites of multiple transcripts have been developed. However, they still present some limitations. Here, we introduce RNA And DNA Interacting Complexes Ligated and sequenced (RADICL-seq), a technology that maps genome-wide RNA-chromatin interactions in intact nuclei. RADICL-seq is a proximity ligation-based methodology that reduces the bias for nascent transcription, while increasing genomic coverage and unique mapping rate efficiency compared to existing methods. RADICL-seq identifies distinct patterns of genome occupancy for different classes of transcripts as well as cell type-specific RNA-chromatin interactions, and emphasizes the role of transcription in the establishment of chromatin structure.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single-cell genomic atlas of great ape cerebral organoids uncovers human-specific features of brain development, bioRxiv, 2019-06-28</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe human brain has changed dramatically since humans diverged from our closest living relatives, chimpanzees and the other great apes1–5. However, the genetic and developmental programs underlying this divergence are not fully understood6–8. Here, we have analyzed stem cell-derived cerebral organoids using single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) and accessible chromatin profiling (scATAC-seq) to explore gene regulatory changes that are specific to humans. We first analyze cell composition and reconstruct differentiation trajectories over the entire course of human cerebral organoid development from pluripotency, through neuroectoderm and neuroepithelial stages, followed by divergence into neuronal fates within the dorsal and ventral forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. We find that brain region composition varies in organoids from different iPSC lines, yet regional gene expression patterns are largely reproducible across individuals. We then analyze chimpanzee and macaque cerebral organoids and find that human neuronal development proceeds at a delayed pace relative to the other two primates. Through pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we identify human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states along progenitor to neuron lineages in the cortex. We find that chromatin accessibility is dynamic during cortex development, and identify instances of accessibility divergence between human and chimpanzee that correlate with human-specific gene expression and genetic change. Finally, we map human-specific expression in adult prefrontal cortex using single-nucleus RNA-seq and find developmental differences that persist into adulthood, as well as cell state-specific changes that occur exclusively in the adult brain. Our data provide a temporal cell atlas of great ape forebrain development, and illuminate dynamic gene regulatory features that are unique to humans.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The mutational footprints of cancer therapies, bioRxiv, 2019-06-28</h4>
          <p>Some cancer therapies damage DNA and cause mutations both in cancer and healthy cells of the patient1. These therapy-induced mutations may underlie some of the long-term and late side effects of the treatment, such as mental disabilities, organ toxicities and secondary neoplasms. Currently we ignore the mutation pattern and burden caused by different cancer treatments. Here we identify mutational signatures, or footprints of six widely-used anti-cancer therapies with the study of whole-genomes from more than 3500 metastatic tumors originated in different organs. These include previously known and new mutational signatures generated by platinum-based drugs, and a novel signature of treatment with nucleoside metabolic inhibitors. Exploiting these mutational footprints, we estimate the contribution of different treatments to the mutation burden of tumors and their risk of causing coding and likely driver mutations in the genome. In summary, the mutational footprints identified here open a window to precisely appraise the mutational risk of different cancer therapies to understand their late side effects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An individual interneuron participates in many kinds of inhibition and spans much of the mouse visual thalamus, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYIn principle, one way to define the functional role of a neuron would be to identify all the synaptic input it receives and all synaptic output it confers onto its targets. With serial electron microscopy we annotated all the input synapses (862) and output synapses (626) associated with one inhibitory interneuron in the visual thalamus of the mouse. This neuron’s neurites covered a broad swath of lateral geniculate nucleus and spanned multiple functionally distinct regions. Every one of its neurites formed synapses onto hundreds of thalamocortical cells of several different types. All but one small neurite also had dendrite-like properties and received input from retinal ganglion cell axons. Pre- and postsynaptic associations with other inhibitory interneurons were also distributed throughout the interneuron’s territory. We observed a diverse array of local synaptic motifs and three fundamentally different types of inhibitory neurites. Many thalamocortical cells were innervated weakly by this interneuron by single en passant shaft synapses. But a subset of the interneuron’s thalamocortical cell targets received multiple synaptic inputs from targeted inhibitory neurites that climbed along the thalamocortical cell’s dendrite with an assemblage of fasciculated retinal ganglion cell axons. Because of the diverse range of synaptic relationships exhibited by this one neuron, this cell defies a single functional label and seems rather to be using extremely local synaptic processing to participate in many different functions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Astrocytes Contribute to Remote Memory Formation by Modulating Hippocampal-Cortical Communication During Learning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe consolidation and retrieval of remote memories depend on the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and frontal cortices. However, the exact time at which these regions are recruited to support memory and the interactions between them are still debated. Astrocytes can sense and modify neuronal activity with great precision, but their role in cognitive function has not been extensively explored. To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying remote memory involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating neuronal activity.</p>
