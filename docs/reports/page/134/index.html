          <p>AbstractWe introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing data, which performs cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting. Alevinâ€™s approach to UMI deduplication accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads, and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">CRISPR-Cas9 interference in cassava linked to the evolution of editing-resistant geminiviruses, bioRxiv, 2018-05-04</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTWe used CRISPR-Cas9 in the staple food crop cassava with the aim of engineering resistance to African cassava mosaic virus, a member of a widespread and important family of plant-pathogenic DNA viruses. We found that between 33 and 48% of edited virus genomes evolved a conserved single-nucleotide mutation that confers resistance to CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage. Our study highlights the potential for virus escape from this technology. Care should be taken to design CRISPR-Cas9 experiments that minimize the risk of virus escape.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Clairvoyante a multi-task convolutional deep neural network for variant calling in Single Molecule Sequencing, bioRxiv, 2018-04-28</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe accurate identification of DNA sequence variants is an important, but challenging task in genomics. It is particularly difficult for single molecule sequencing, which has a per-nucleotide error rate of ~5%-15%. Meeting this demand, we developed Clairvoyante, a multi-task five-layer convolutional neural network model for predicting variant type (SNP or indel), zygosity, alternative allele and indel length from aligned reads. For the well-characterized NA12878 human sample, Clairvoyante achieved 99.73%, 97.68% and 95.36% precision on known variants, and 98.65%, 92.57%, 87.26% F1-score for whole-genome analysis, using Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore data, respectively. Training on a second human sample shows Clairvoyante is sample agnostic and finds variants in less than two hours on a standard server. Furthermore, we identified 3,135 variants that are missed using Illumina but supported independently by both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore reads. Clairvoyante is available open-source (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comaquaskylineClairvoyante&gt;httpsgithub.comaquaskylineClairvoyante&lt;jatsext-link&gt;), with modules to train, utilize and visualize the model.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Single cell RNA-seq denoising using a deep count autoencoder, bioRxiv, 2018-04-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at a cellular resolution. However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNAseq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia, bioRxiv, 2018-03-31</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe genetic formation of Central and South Asian populations has been unclear because of an absence of ancient DNA. To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asiaâ€”consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVCâ€”and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry. Our results show how ancestry from the Steppe genetically linked Europe and South Asia in the Bronze Age, and identifies the populations that almost certainly were responsible for spreading Indo-European languages across much of Eurasia.One Sentence SummaryGenome wide ancient DNA from 357 individuals from Central and South Asia sheds new light on the spread of Indo-European languages and parallels between the genetic history of two sub-continents, Europe and South Asia.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Large-scale neuroimaging and genetic study reveals genetic architecture of brain white matter microstructure, bioRxiv, 2018-03-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractMicrostructural changes of white matter (WM) tracts are known to be associated with various neuropsychiatric disordersdiseases. Heritability of structural changes of WM tracts has been examined using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in family-based studies for different age groups. The availability of genetic and DTI data from recent large population-based studies offers opportunity to further improve our understanding of genetic contributions. Here, we analyzed the genetic architecture of WM tracts using DTI and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data of unrelated individuals in the UK Biobank (n âˆ¼ 8000). The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton. Comparing the estimates from the UK Biobank to those from small population-based studies, we illustrated that sufficiently large sample size is essential for genetic architecture discovery in imaging genetics. We confirmed this finding with a simulation study.</p>
