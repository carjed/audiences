          <p>AbstractThe lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most popular and iconic feline species on the planet, yet in spite of its popularity, the last century has seen massive declines for lion populations worldwide. Genomic resources for endangered species represent an important way forward for the field of conservation, enabling high-resolution studies of demography, disease, and population dynamics. Here, we present a chromosome-level assembly for the captive African lion from the Exotic Feline Rescue Center as a resource for current and subsequent genetic work of the sole social species of the Panthera clade. Our assembly is composed of 10x Genomics Chromium data, Dovetail Hi-C, and Oxford Nanopore long-read data. Synteny is highly conserved between the lion, other Panthera genomes, and the domestic cat. We find variability in the length and levels of homozygosity across the genomes of the lion sequenced here and other previous published resequence data, indicating contrasting histories of recent and ancient small population sizes andor inbreeding. Demographic analyses reveal similar histories across all individuals except the Asiatic lion, which shows a more rapid decline in population size. This high-quality genome will greatly aid in the continuing research and conservation efforts for the lion.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Peripheral blood cell immunophenotyping reveals distinct subgroups of inflamed depression, bioRxiv, 2019-07-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractDepression has been associated with increased inflammatory proteins but changes in circulating immune cells are less well defined. We used multi-parametric flow cytometry to investigate 14 subsets of peripheral blood cells in 206 cases of major depressive disorder (MDD) and 77 age- and sex-matched controls. There were significant case-control differences, by univariate and multivariate analysis cases showed increased immune cell counts, especially neutrophils, CD4&#43; T cells and monocytes, and increased inflammatory proteins (C-reactive protein and interleukin-6). Within-group analysis demonstrated significant association between the severity of depressive symptoms and increased myeloid and CD4&#43; cell counts. MDD cases could be partitioned into two groups by forced binary clustering of cell counts the inflamed depression group (N=81 out of 206; 39%) had increased monocyte, CD4&#43; and neutrophil counts, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), and was more depressed than the uninflamed majority of cases. Relaxing the presumption of a binary classification, data-driven clustering identified four subgroups of MDD cases two of these subgroups (N=38 and N=100; 67% collectively) were associated with increased inflammatory proteins and more severe depression, but differed from each other in the relative weighting of myeloid and lymphoid cell counts. Case-control and within-group results were robust to statistical control for the potentially confounding effects of age, sex, BMI, recent infection status, and tobacco use. Peripheral blood immunophenotyping can be used to identify a candidate cellular biomarker of inflamed depression, and to further decompose that binary partition, suggesting that there is more than one mechanistic pathway underlying inflamed depression.One Sentence SummaryTwo subgroups of depressed cases (about two-thirds of all 206 cases) were identified by peripheral blood biomarker evidence of distinctive cellular immunophenotypes, biased towards the myeloid or lymphoid lineages in different subgroups, but consistently associated with increased blood concentrations of inflammatory proteins and greater severity of depressive symptoms.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Weak and uneven associations of home, neighborhood and school environments with stress hormone output across multiple time scales, bioRxiv, 2019-07-18</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTThe progression of lifelong trajectories of socioeconomic inequalities in health and mortality begins in childhood. Dysregulation in cortisol, a stress hormone that is the primary output of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for how early environmental adversity compromises health. However, despite the popularity of cortisol as a biomarker for stress and adversity, little is known about whether cortisol output differs in children being raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. Here, we show that there are few differences between advantaged and disadvantaged children in their cortisol output. In 8- to 14-year-old children from the population-based Texas Twin Project, we measured cortisol output at three different time-scales (1) diurnal fluctuation in salivary cortisol (n = 400), (2) salivary cortisol reactivity and recovery after exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test (n = 444), and (3) and cortisol concentration in hair (n = 1,210). These measures converged on two moderately correlated, yet distinguishable, dimensions of HPA function. We then tested differences in cortisol output across nine aspects of social disadvantage at the home (e.g., family socioeconomic status), school (e.g., average levels of academic achievement), and neighborhood (e.g., concentrated poverty). Children living in neighborhoods with higher concentrated poverty had higher diurnal cortisol output, as measured in saliva; otherwise, child cortisol output was unrelated to any other aspect of social disadvantage. Overall, we find limited support for alteration in HPA axis functioning as a general mechanism for the health consequences of socioeconomic inequality in childhood.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">An integrated brain-machine interface platform with thousands of channels, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractBrain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold promise for the restoration of sensory and motor function and the treatment of neurological disorders, but clinical BMIs have not yet been widely adopted, in part because modest channel counts have limited their potential. In this white paper, we describe Neuralink’s first steps toward a scalable high-bandwidth BMI system. We have built arrays of small and flexible electrode “threads”, with as many as 3,072 electrodes per array distributed across 96 threads. We have also built a neurosurgical robot capable of inserting six threads (192 electrodes) per minute. Each thread can be individually inserted into the brain with micron precision for avoidance of surface vasculature and targeting specific brain regions. The electrode array is packaged into a small implantable device that contains custom chips for low-power on-board amplification and digitization the package for 3,072 channels occupies less than (23 × 18.5 × 2) mm3. A single USB-C cable provides full-bandwidth data streaming from the device, recording from all channels simultaneously. This system has achieved a spiking yield of up to 70% in chronically implanted electrodes. Neuralink’s approach to BMI has unprecedented packaging density and scalability in a clinically relevant package.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Compartment-dependent chromatin interaction dynamics revealed by liquid chromatin Hi-C, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYChromosomes are folded so that active and inactive chromatin domains are spatially segregated. Compartmentalization is thought to occur through polymer phasemicrophase separation mediated by interactions between loci of similar type. The nature and dynamics of these interactions are not known. We developed liquid chromatin Hi-C to map the stability of associations between loci. Before fixation and Hi-C, chromosomes are fragmented removing the strong polymeric constraint to enable detection of intrinsic locus-locus interaction stabilities. Compartmentalization is stable when fragments are over 10-25 kb. Fragmenting chromatin into pieces smaller than 6 kb leads to gradual loss of genome organization. Dissolution kinetics of chromatin interactions vary for different chromatin domains. Lamin-associated domains are most stable, while interactions among speckle and polycomb-associated loci are more dynamic. Cohesin-mediated loops dissolve after fragmentation, possibly because cohesin rings slide off nearby DNA ends. Liquid chromatin Hi-C provides a genome-wide view of chromosome interaction dynamics.Highlights&lt;jatslist list-type=bullet&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Liquid chromatin Hi-C detects chromatin interaction dissociation rates genome-wide&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Chromatin conformations in distinct nuclear compartments differ in stability&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;Stable heterochromatic associations are major drivers of chromatin phase separation&lt;jatslist-item&gt;&lt;jatslist-item&gt;CTCF-CTCF loops are stabilized by encirclement of loop bases by cohesin rings&lt;jatslist-item&gt;</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DNA mismatches reveal widespread conformational penalties in protein-DNA recognition, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTTranscription-factor (TF) proteins recognize specific genomic sequences, despite an overwhelming excess of non-specific DNA, to regulate complex gene expression programs1–3. While there have been significant advances in understanding how DNA sequence and shape contribute to recognition, some fundamental aspects of protein-DNA binding remain poorly understood2,3. Many DNA-binding proteins induce changes in the DNA structure outside the intrinsic B-DNA envelope. How the energetic cost associated with distorting DNA contributes to recognition has proven difficult to study and measure experimentally because the distorted DNA structures exist as low-abundance conformations in the naked B-DNA ensemble4–10. Here, we use a novel high-throughput assay called SaMBA (Saturation Mismatch-Binding Assay) to investigate the role of DNA conformational penalties in TF-DNA recognition. The approach introduces mismatched base-pairs (i.e. mispairs) within TF binding sites to pre-induce a variety of DNA structural distortions much larger than those induced by changes in Watson-Crick sequence. Strikingly, while most mismatches either weakened TF binding (~70%) or had negligible effects (~20%), approximately 10% of mismatches increased binding and at least one mismatch was found that increased the binding affinity for each of 21 examined TFs. Mismatches also converted sites from the non-specific affinity range into specific sites, and high-affinity sites into “super-sites” stronger than any known canonical binding site. These findings reveal a complex binding landscape that cannot be explained based on DNA sequence alone. Analysis of crystal structures together with NMR and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that many of the mismatches that increase binding induce distortions similar to those induced by TF binding, thus pre-paying some of the energetic cost to deform the DNA. Our work indicates that conformational penalties are a major determinant of protein-DNA recognition, and reveals mechanisms by which mismatches can recruit TFs and thus modulate replication and repair activities in the cell11,12.</p>
