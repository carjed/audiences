          <p>AbstractHere, we describe the third major release of relion. CPU-based vector acceleration has been added in addition to GPU support, which provides flexibility in use of resources and avoids memory limitations. Reference-free autopicking with Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering and execution of jobs from python allows non-interactive processing during acquisition, including 2D-classification, de novo model generation and 3D-classification. Perparticle refinement of CTF parameters and correction of estimated beam tilt provides higher-resolution reconstructions when particles are at different heights in the ice, andor coma-free alignment has not been optimal. Ewald sphere curvature correction improves resolution for large particles. We illustrate these developments with publicly available data sets together with a Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction it leads to resolution improvements of 0.2-0.7 Å compared to previous relion versions.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genomic prediction of cognitive traits in childhood and adolescence, bioRxiv, 2018-09-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent advances in genomics are producing powerful DNA predictors of complex traits, especially cognitive abilities. Here, we leveraged summary statistics from the most recent genome-wide association studies of intelligence and educational attainment to build prediction models of general cognitive ability and educational achievement. To this end, we compared the performances of multi-trait genomic and polygenic scoring methods. In a representative UK sample of 7,026 children at age 12 and 16, we show that we can now predict up to 11 percent of the variance in intelligence and 16 percent in educational achievement. We also show that predictive power increases from age 12 to age 16 and that genomic predictions do not differ for girls and boys. Multivariate genomic methods were effective in boosting predictive power and, even though prediction accuracy varied across polygenic scores approaches, results were similar using different multivariate and polygenic score methods. Polygenic scores for educational attainment and intelligence are the most powerful predictors in the behavioural sciences and exceed predictions that can be made from parental phenotypes such as educational attainment and occupational status.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Maternal gut and breast milk microbiota affect infant gut antibiotic resistome and mobile genetic elements, Nature Communications, 2018-09-18</h4>
          <p>The infant gut microbiota has a high abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) compared to adults, even in the absence of antibiotic exposure. Here we study potential sources of infant gut ARGs by performing metagenomic sequencing of breast milk, as well as infant and maternal gut microbiomes. We find that fecal ARG and mobile genetic element (MGE) profiles of infants are more similar to those of their own mothers than to those of unrelated mothers. MGEs in mothers’ breast milk are also shared with their own infants. Termination of breastfeeding and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis of mothers, which have the potential to affect microbial community composition, are associated with higher abundances of specific ARGs, the composition of which is largely shaped by bacterial phylogeny in the infant gut. Our results suggest that infants inherit the legacy of past antibiotic consumption of their mothers via transmission of genes, but microbiota composition still strongly impacts the overall resistance load.</p>

          <p>High blood pressure is a highly heritable and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We report the largest genetic association study of blood pressure traits (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressure) to date in over 1 million people of European ancestry. We identify 535 novel blood pressure loci that not only offer new biological insights into blood pressure regulation but also highlight shared genetic architecture between blood pressure and lifestyle exposures. Our findings identify new biological pathways for blood pressure regulation with potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future.</p>

          <p>ABSTRACTBacterial CRISPR systems have been widely adopted to create operator-specified site-specific nucleases. Such nuclease action commonly results in loss-of-function alleles, facilitating functional analysis of genes and gene families We conducted a systematic comparison of components and T-DNA architectures for CRISPR-mediated gene editing in Arabidopsis, testing multiple promoters, terminators, sgRNA backbones and Cas9 alleles. We identified a T-DNA architecture that usually results in stable (i.e. homozygous) mutations in the first generation after transformation. Notably, the transcription of sgRNA and Cas9 in head-to-head divergent orientation usually resulted in highly active lines. Our Arabidopsis data may prove useful for optimization of CRISPR methods in other plants.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Probing variability in a cognitive map using manifold inference from neural dynamics, bioRxiv, 2018-09-17</h4>
          <p>Hippocampal neurons fire selectively in local behavioral contexts such as the position in an environment or phase of a task,1-3 and are thought to form a cognitive map of task-relevant variables.1,4,5 However, their activity varies over repeated behavioral conditions,6 such as different runs through the same position or repeated trials. Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold—a space of possible network states. The manifold’s structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.</p>
