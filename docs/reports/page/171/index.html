          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">C. elegans discriminate colors without eyes or opsins, bioRxiv, 2016-12-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractHere we establish that, contrary to expectations, Caenorhabditis elegans nematode worms possess a color discrimination system despite lacking any opsin or other known visible light photoreceptor genes. We found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. Absorption of amber light by this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance. By combining narrow-band blue and amber light sources, we demonstrated that detection of the specific blueamber ratio by the worm guides its foraging decision. These behavioral and psychophysical studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Population-genomic inference of the strength and timing of selection against gene flow, bioRxiv, 2016-09-02</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Empirical assessment of published effect sizes and power in the recent cognitive neuroscience and psychology literature, bioRxiv, 2016-08-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractWe have empirically assessed the distribution of published effect sizes and estimated power by extracting more than 100,000 statistical records from about 10,000 cognitive neuroscience and psychology papers published during the past 5 years. The reported median effect size was d=0.93 (inter-quartile range 0.64-1.46) for nominally statistically significant results and d=0.24 (0.11-0.42) for non-significant results. Median power to detect small, medium and large effects was 0.12, 0.44 and 0.73, reflecting no improvement through the past half-century. Power was lowest for cognitive neuroscience journals. 14% of papers reported some statistically significant results, although the respective F statistic and degrees of freedom proved that these were non-significant; p value errors positively correlated with journal impact factors. False report probability is likely to exceed 50% for the whole literature. In light of our findings the recently reported low replication success in psychology is realistic and worse performance may be expected for cognitive neuroscience.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Deep Learning and Association Rule Mining for Predicting Drug Response in Cancer. A Personalised Medicine Approach, bioRxiv, 2016-08-20</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTA major challenge in cancer treatment is predicting the clinical response to anti-cancer drugs for each individual patient. For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the “omics” era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the “omics” data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Cytoarchitectonic similarity is a wiring principle of the human connectome, bioRxiv, 2016-08-07</h4>
          <p>AbstractUnderstanding the wiring diagram of the human cerebral cortex is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Elemental aspects of its organization remain elusive. Here we examine which structural traits of cortical regions, particularly their cytoarchitecture and thickness, relate to the existence and strength of inter-regional connections. We use the architecture data from the classic work of von Economo and Koskinas and state-of-the-art diffusion-based connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results reveal a prominent role of the cytoarchitectonic similarity of supragranular layers for predicting the existence and strength of connections. In contrast, cortical thickness similarity was not related to the existence or strength of connections. These results are in line with findings for non-human mammalian cerebral cortices, suggesting overarching wiring principles of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The results invite hypotheses about evolutionary conserved neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to the relation of cytoarchitecture and connectivity in the human cerebral cortex.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A tutorial on how (not) to over-interpret STRUCTUREADMIXTURE bar plots, bioRxiv, 2016-07-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractGenetic clustering algorithms, implemented in popular programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE, have been used extensively in the characterisation of individuals and populations based on genetic data. A successful example is the reconstruction of the genetic history of African Americans who are a product of recent admixture between highly differentiated populations. Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (badMIXTURE, available at github.comdanjlawsonbadMIXTURE) to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry “palettes” estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies. Combining these complementary analyses with additional methods that are designed to test specific hypotheses allows a richer and more robust analysis of recent demographic history based on genetic data.</p>
