          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assessment of computational methods for the analysis of single-cell ATAC-seq data, bioRxiv, 2019-08-18</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundRecent innovations in single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) enable profiling of the epigenetic landscape of thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq data analysis presents unique methodological challenges. scATAC-seq experiments sample DNA, which, due to low copy numbers (diploid in humans) lead to inherent data sparsity (1-10% of peaks detected per cell) compared to transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data (20-50% of expressed genes detected per cell). Such challenges in data generation emphasize the need for informative features to assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level.ResultsWe present a benchmarking framework that was applied to 10 computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and featurizing scATAC-seq data were evaluated by their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis including inherently sparse data, determination of features, peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise, and clustering performance. Running times and memory requirements are also discussed.ConclusionsThis reference summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform other methods in separating cell populations of different coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real datasets. Notably, SnapATAC was the only method able to analyze a large dataset (&amp;gt; 80,000 cells).</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Expression profiling of the mature C. elegans nervous system by single-cell RNA-Sequencing, bioRxiv, 2019-08-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractA single neuron and its synapses define the fundamental structural motif of the brain but the underlying gene expression programs that specify individual neuron types are poorly understood. To address this question in a model organism, we have produced a gene expression profile of &amp;gt;90% of the individual neuron classes in the C. elegans nervous system, an ensemble of neurons for which both the anatomy and connectivity are uniquely defined at single cell resolution. We generated single cell transcriptomes for 52,412 neurons that resolve as clusters corresponding to 109 of the canonical 118 neuron classes in the mature hermaphrodite nervous system. Detailed analysis revealed molecular signatures that further subdivide identified classes into specific neuronal subtypes. Notably, neuropeptide-related genes are often differentially expressed between subtypes of the given neuron class which points to distinct functional characteristics. All of these data are publicly available at our website (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpwww.cengen.org&gt;httpwww.cengen.org&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) and can be interrogated at the web application SCeNGEA (&lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpscengen.shinyapps.ioSCeNGEA&gt;httpscengen.shinyapps.ioSCeNGEA&lt;jatsext-link&gt;). We expect that this gene expression catalog will spur the goal of delineating the underlying mechanisms that define the developmental lineage, detailed anatomy, synaptic connectivity and function of each type of C. elegans neuron.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Telomere-to-telomere assembly of a complete human X chromosome, bioRxiv, 2019-08-17</h4>
          <p>After nearly two decades of improvements, the current human reference genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate genome ever produced. However, no one chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist 1,2. The remaining gaps include ribosomal rDNA arrays, large near-identical segmental duplications, and satellite DNA arrays. These regions harbor largely unexplored variation of unknown consequence, and their absence from the current reference genome can lead to experimental artifacts and hide true variants when re-sequencing additional human genomes. Here we present a de novo human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38 2, along with the first gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome 3, we reconstructed the ∼2.8 megabase centromeric satellite DNA array and closed all 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequence from the human pseudoautosomal regions and cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). This complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, also allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays for the first time. These results demonstrate that finishing the human genome is now within reach and will enable ongoing efforts to complete the remaining human chromosomes.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ancestral reconstruction of sunflower karyotypes reveals non-random chromosomal evolution, bioRxiv, 2019-08-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractMapping the chromosomal rearrangements between species can inform our understanding of genome evolution, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Here we present a novel algorithm for identifying regions of synteny in pairs of genetic maps, which is implemented in the accompanying R package, syntR. The syntR algorithm performs as well as previous ad-hoc methods while being systematic, repeatable, and is applicable to mapping chromosomal rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax.Using syntR, and we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years – a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This non-random exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our understanding of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus has an exceptional rate of chromosomal rearrangement that may facilitate similarly rapid diversification.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Plasmodium vivaxMalaria viewed through the lens of an eradicated European strain, bioRxiv, 2019-08-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe protozoanPlasmodium vivaxis responsible for 42% of all cases of malaria outside Africa. The parasite is currently largely restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes in Asia, Oceania and the Americas. Though, it was historically present in most of Europe before being finally eradicated during the second half of the 20th century. The lack of genomic information on the extinct European lineage has prevented a clear understanding of historical population structuring and past migrations ofP. vivax. We used medical microscope slides prepared in 1944 from malaria-affected patients from the Ebro Delta in Spain, one of the last footholds of malaria in Europe, to generate a genome of a EuropeanP. vivaxstrain. Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses placed this strain basal to a cluster including samples from the Americas. This genome allowed us to calibrate a genomic mutation rate forP. vivax, and to estimate the mean age of the last common ancestor between European and American strains to the 15th century. This date points to an introduction of the parasite during the European colonisation of the Americas. In addition, we found that some known variants for resistance to anti-malarial drugs, including Chloroquine and Sulfadoxine, were already present in this European strain, predating their use. Our results shed light on the evolution of an important human pathogen and illustrate the value of antique medical collections as a resource for retrieving genomic information on pathogens from the past.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Modulation of sensory behavior and food choice by an enteric bacteria-produced neurotransmitter, bioRxiv, 2019-08-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractAnimals coexist in commensal, pathogenic or mutualistic relationships with complex communities of diverse organisms including microbes1. Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters which have been proposed to modulate host nervous system activity and behaviors2. However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain modulation and its physiological relevance is largely unknown. Here we show that in C. elegans, the neuromodulator tyramine (TA) produced by gut-colonizing commensal Providencia bacteria can bypass the requirement for host TA biosynthesis to manipulate a host sensory decision. Bacterially-produced TA is likely converted to octopamine (OA) by the host tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme. OA, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 receptor on the ASHASI sensory neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify genes required for TA biosynthesis in Providencia, and show that these genes are necessary for modulation of host behavior. We further find that C. elegans colonized by Providencia preferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially-produced TA. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut microbiota mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, thereby promoting fitness of both host and microbe.</p>
