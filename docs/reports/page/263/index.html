          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Extracting a Biologically Relevant Latent Space from Cancer Transcriptomes with Variational Autoencoders, bioRxiv, 2017-08-12</h4>
          <p>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor’s response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method “Tybalt” after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”. From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific activated expression patterns that would result from genetic changes or treatment effects.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">MSPminer abundance-based reconstitution of microbial pan-genomes from shotgun meta-genomic data, bioRxiv, 2017-08-09</h4>
          <p>AbstractMotivationAnalysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.ResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.AvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.frsitedownloads Contact florian.plaza-onate@inra.frSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Genome-wide association study identifies 30 Loci Associated with Bipolar Disorder, bioRxiv, 2017-08-08</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTBipolar disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder that features episodes of mania and depression. We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date, including 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls of European descent, with follow-up analysis of 822 sentinel variants at loci with P&amp;lt;1×10-4 in an independent sample of 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls. In the combined analysis, 30 loci reached genome-wide significant evidence for association, of which 20 were novel. These significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters (CACNA1C, GRIN2A, SCN2A, SLC4A1), synaptic components (RIMS1, ANK3), immune and energy metabolism components. Bipolar disorder type I (depressive and manic episodes; ~73% of our cases) is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia whereas bipolar disorder type II (depressive and hypomanic episodes; ~17% of our cases) is more strongly correlated with major depressive disorder. These findings address key clinical questions and provide potential new biological mechanisms for bipolar disorder.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Bioinformatics Core Competencies for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education, bioRxiv, 2017-08-04</h4>
          <p>AbstractBioinformatics is becoming increasingly central to research in the life sciences. However, despite its importance, bioinformatics skills and knowledge are not well integrated in undergraduate biology education. This curricular gap prevents biology students from harnessing the full potential of their education, limiting their career opportunities and slowing genomic research innovation. To advance the integration of bioinformatics into life sciences education, a framework of core bioinformatics competencies is needed. To that end, we here report the results of a survey of life sciences faculty in the United States about teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate life scientists. Responses were received from 1,260 faculty representing institutions in all fifty states with a combined capacity to educate hundreds of thousands of students every year. Results indicate strong, widespread agreement that bioinformatics knowledge and skills are critical for undergraduate life scientists, as well as considerable agreement about which skills are necessary. Perceptions of the importance of some skills varied with the respondent’s degree of training, time since degree earned, andor the Carnegie classification of the respondent’s institution. To assess which skills are currently being taught, we analyzed syllabi of courses with bioinformatics content submitted by survey respondents. Finally, we used the survey results, the analysis of syllabi, and our collective research and teaching expertise to develop a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life sciences students. These core competencies are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they work to integrate bioinformatics into their life sciences curricula.Significance StatementBioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques from computer science and mathematics to store, manage, and analyze biological data, is becoming increasingly central to modern biology research. Given the widespread use of bioinformatics and its impacts on societal problem-solving (e.g., in healthcare, agriculture, and natural resources management), there is a growing need for the integration of bioinformatics competencies into undergraduate life sciences education. Here, we present a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life scientists developed using the results of a large national survey and the expertise of our working group of bioinformaticians and educators. We also present results from the survey on the importance of bioinformatics skills and the current state of integration of bioinformatics into biology education.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Accurate detection of complex structural variations using single molecule sequencing, bioRxiv, 2017-07-29</h4>
          <p>AbstractStructural variations (SVs) are the largest source of genetic variation, but remain poorly understood because of limited genomics technology. Single molecule long read sequencing from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore has the potential to dramatically advance the field, although their high error rates challenge existing methods. Addressing this need, we introduce open-source methods for long read alignment (NGMLR, &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comphilresngmlr&gt;httpsgithub.comphilresngmlr&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) and SV identification (Sniffles, &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comfritzsedlazeckSniffles&gt;httpsgithub.comfritzsedlazeckSniffles&lt;jatsext-link&gt;) that enable unprecedented SV sensitivity and precision, including within repeat-rich regions and of complex nested events that can have significant impact on human disorders. Examining several datasets, including healthy and cancerous human genomes, we discover thousands of novel variants using long reads and categorize systematic errors in short-read approaches. NGMLR and Sniffles are further able to automatically filter false events and operate on low amounts of coverage to address the cost factor that has hindered the application of long reads in clinical and research settings.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?, bioRxiv, 2017-07-28</h4>
          <p>Short abstractI argue that the popular neural coding metaphor is often misleading. First, the “neural code” often spans both the experimental apparatus and the brain. Second, a neural code is information only by reference to something with a known meaning, which is not the kind of information relevant for a perceptual system. Third, the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of the brain (circular, dynamic). I conclude that a causal description of the brain cannot be based on neural codes, because spikes are more like actions than hieroglyphs.Long abstract“Neural coding” is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable. Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, while spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the informational requirements of cognition.</p>
