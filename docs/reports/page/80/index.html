          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">DeepPoseKit, a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning, bioRxiv, 2019-04-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractQuantitative behavioral measurements are important for answering questions across scientific disciplines—from neuroscience to ecology. State-of-the-art deep-learning methods offer major advances in data quality and detail by allowing researchers to automatically estimate locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images or videos. However, currently-available animal pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. Here we introduce a new easy-to-use software toolkit, DeepPoseKit, that addresses these problems using an eZcient multi-scale deep-learning model, called Stacked DenseNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision. These advances improve processing speed &amp;gt;2× with no loss in accuracy compared to currently-available methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings—including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Immunogenomic landscape of hematological malignancies, bioRxiv, 2019-04-27</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYUnderstanding factors that shape the immune landscape across hematological malignancies is essential for immunotherapy development. Here, we integrated over 8,000 transcriptomes and over 1,000 samples with multilevel genomic data of hematological cancers to investigate how immunological features are linked to cancer subtypes, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and patient survival. Infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells was associated with distinct microenvironmental responses and driver alterations in different cancers, such as TP53 in acute myeloid leukemia and DTX1 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Epigenetic modification of CIITA regulating antigen presentation, cancer type-specific immune checkpoints such as VISTA in myeloid malignancies, and variation in cancer antigen expression further contributed to immune heterogeneity. Prognostic models highlighted the significance of immunological properties in predicting survival. Our study represents the most comprehensive effort to date to link immunology with cancer subtypes and genomics in hematological malignancies, providing a resource to guide future studies and immunotherapy development.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Safety and Tolerability of Bacteriophage Therapy in Severe Staphylococcus aureus Infection, bioRxiv, 2019-04-27</h4>
          <p>AbstractImportanceThe effect of IV administration of a bacteriophage cocktail produced under GMP conditions on patients with severe S. aureus infection, including complicated bacteraemia, endocarditis and septic shock, is unknown.ObjectiveTo assess safety and tolerability of adjunctive bacteriophage therapy in patients with severe S. aureus infections.Design, Setting, ParticipantsObservational, open-label clinical trial of thirteen critically-ill patients admitted to a tertiary-referral hospital with S. aureus bacteraemia (including infective endocarditis, n=6) were assessed by the treating clinician and two consulting infectious diseases physicians to independently verify that routine medical and surgical therapy was optimal and that a poor outcome remained likely. Compassionate access to therapy was approved by both US and Australian regulators and by the Westmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee.InterventionA GMP-quality preparation of three combined Myoviridae bacteriophages with specific activity against S. aureus (AB-SA01), was administered intravenously in conjunction with optimal antibiotic therapy.Main Outcome and MeasurementsPhysiological, haematological and biochemical markers of infection, bacterial and bacteriophage kinetics in blood, development of resistance to bacteriophages, and mortality at 28 (D28) and 90 (D90) days were measured. Main outcomes were safety and tolerability.ResultsBacteriophage therapy was initiated 4-10 days after antibiotic commencement, at 109 plaque-forming units (PFU) twice daily. Infecting staphylococci were typical of common local subtypes. Initial input ratio of phages to bacteria in the bloodstream (MOIinput) was &amp;gt;100. Five of the thirteen patients died by D28 and a sixth patient suffered sudden cardiac death on D90. Bacteriophage therapy coincided with a marked reduction in staphylococcal bacterial DNA in the blood and in sepsis-associated inflammatory responses in almost all cases. No bacteriophage-attributable adverse events were identified. Development of bacteriophage resistance was not observed. Population analysis revealed no significant effect of bacteriophage therapy on the gut microflora.Conclusions and RelevanceAdjunctive bacteriophage therapy appears to be safe and well-tolerated in critically ill patients with severe S. aureus infection. Two weeks of twice daily intravenous administration may be a suitable protocol. Controlled trials are needed.Trial RegistrationWestmead Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee approval July 11, 2017; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier &lt;jatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=clintrialgov xlinkhref=NCT03395769&gt;NCT03395769&lt;jatsext-link&gt;, AB-SA01-EAP01 (January 10, 2018); Clinical Trials Notification (Australian Therapeutic Goods Association) CT-2018-CTN-02372-1 (July 23, 2018).Key PointsQuestionIs intravenous (IV) administration of investigational bacteriophage (phage) therapy safe and well-tolerated in patients with severe Staphylococcus aureus infection?FindingsThirteen patients with severe S. aureus infections received AB-SA01, a bacteriophage product prepared according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), as adjunctive therapy to antibiotics. AB-SA01 was well-tolerated with no adverse events identified. Bacterial burden and inflammatory responses were reduced and no phage-resistant staphylococci were isolated during or after therapy.MeaningOur results will inform future randomised controlled trials assessing the antibacterial and anti-inflammatory potential of bacteriophages in the treatment of severe S. aureus infection.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Assembly-free single-molecule nanopore sequencing recovers complete virus genomes from natural microbial communities, bioRxiv, 2019-04-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractViruses are the most abundant biological entities on Earth, and play key roles in host ecology, evolution, and horizontal gene transfer. Despite recent progress in viral metagenomics, the inherent genetic complexity of virus populations still poses technical difficulties for recovering complete virus genomes from natural assemblages. To address these challenges, we developed an assembly-free, single-molecule nanopore sequencing approach enabling direct recovery of high-quality viral genome sequences from environmental samples. Our method yielded over a thousand high quality, full-length draft virus genome sequences that could not be fully recovered using short read assembly approaches applied to the same samples. Additionally, novel DNA sequences were discovered whose repeat structures, gene contents and concatemer lengths suggested that they represent phage-inducible chromosomal islands that were packaged as concatemers within phage particles. Our new approach provided novel insight into genome structures, population biology, and ecology of naturally occurring viruses and viral parasites.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">CTCF-dependent chromatin boundaries formed by asymmetric nucleosome arrays with decreased linker length, bioRxiv, 2019-04-26</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) organises the genome in 3D through DNA loops and in 1D by setting boundaries isolating different chromatin states, but these processes are not well understood. Here we focus on the relationship between CTCF binding and the decrease of the Nucleosome Repeat Length (NRL) for ∼20 adjacent nucleosomes, affecting up to 10% of the mouse genome. We found that the chromatin boundary near CTCF is created by the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) asymmetrically located &amp;gt;40 nucleotides 5’-upstream from the centre of CTCF motif. The strength of CTCF binding to DNA is correlated with the decrease of NRL near CTCF and anti-correlated with the level of asymmetry of the nucleosome array. Individual chromatin remodellers have different contributions, with Snf2h having the strongest effect on the NRL decrease near CTCF and Chd4 playing a major role in the symmetry breaking. Upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts, a subset of common CTCF sites preserved in all three cell types maintains a relatively small local NRL despite genome-wide NRL increase. The sites which lost CTCF upon differentiation are characterised by nucleosome rearrangement 3’-downstream, but the boundary defined by the NDR 5’-upstream of CTCF motif remains.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Rapid, Low-Cost Detection of Water Contaminants Using Regulated In Vitro Transcription, bioRxiv, 2019-04-26</h4>
          <p>ABSTRACTSynthetic biology has enabled the development of powerful nucleic acid diagnostic technologies for detecting pathogens and human health biomarkers. Here we expand the reach of synthetic biology-enabled diagnostics by developing a cell-free biosensing platform that uses RNA output sensors activated by ligand induction (ROSALIND) to detect harmful contaminants in aqueous samples. ROSALIND consists of three programmable components highly-processive RNA polymerases, allosteric transcription factors, and synthetic DNA transcription templates. Together, these components allosterically regulate the in vitro transcription of a fluorescence-activating RNA aptamer in the absence of a target compound, transcription is blocked, while in its presence a fluorescent signal is produced. We demonstrate that ROSALIND can be configured to detect a range of water contaminants, including antibiotics, toxic small molecules, and metals. Our cell-free biosensing platform, which can be freeze-dried for field deployment, creates a new capability for point-of-use monitoring of molecular species to address growing global crises in water quality and human health.</p>
