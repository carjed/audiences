          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Somatosensory-Motor Dysconnectivity Spans Multiple Transdiagnostic Dimensions of Psychopathology, bioRxiv, 2019-05-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractBackgroundThere is considerable interest in a dimensional transdiagnostic approach to psychiatry. Most transdiagnostic studies have derived factors based only on clinical symptoms, which might miss possible links between psychopathology, cognitive processes and personality traits. Furthermore, many psychiatric studies focus on higher-order association brain networks, thus neglecting the potential influence of huge swaths of the brain.MethodsA multivariate data-driven approach (partial least squares; PLS) was utilized to identify latent components linking a large set of clinical, cognitive and personality measures to whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns across 224 participants. The participants were either healthy (N=110) or diagnosed with bipolar disorder (N=40), attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (N=37), schizophrenia (N=29) or schizoaffective disorder (N=8). In contrast to traditional case-control analyses, the diagnostic categories were not utilized in the PLS analysis, but were helpful for interpreting the components.ResultsOur analyses revealed three latent components corresponding to general psychopathology, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity. Each component was associated with a unique whole-brain RSFC signature and shared across all participants. The components were robust across multiple control analyses and replicated using independent task functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the same participants. Strikingly, all three components featured connectivity alterations within the somatosensory-motor network, and its connectivity with subcortical structures and cortical executive networks.ConclusionsWe identified three distinct dimensions with dissociable (but overlapping) whole-brain RSFC signatures across healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric illness, providing potential intermediate phenotypes that span across diagnostic categories. Our results suggest expanding the focus of psychiatric neuroscience beyond higher-order brain networks.</p>

          <p>AbstractThe ClpXP machinery is a two component protease complex performing targeted protein degradation in bacteria and eukaryotes. The complex consists of the AAA&#43; chaperone ClpX and the peptidase ClpP. The hexameric ClpX utilizes the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to engage, unfold and translocate substrates into the catalytic chamber of tetradecameric ClpP where they are degraded. Formation of the complex involves a symmetry mismatch, since hexameric AAA&#43; rings bind axially to the opposing stacked heptameric rings of the tetradecameric ClpP. Here we present the first high-resolution cryo-EM structure of ClpXP from Listeria monocytogenes. We unravel the heptamer-hexamer binding interface and provide novel insights into the ClpX-ClpP crosstalk and activation mechanism. The comparison with available crystal structures of ClpP and ClpX in different states allows us to understand important aspects of ClpXP’s complex mode of action and provides a structural framework for future pharmacological applications.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">metaFlye scalable long-read metagenome assembly using repeat graphs, bioRxiv, 2019-05-15</h4>
          <p>AbstractLong-read sequencing technologies substantially improved assemblies of many isolate bacterial genomes as compared to fragmented assemblies produced with short-read technologies. However, assembling complex metagenomic datasets remains a challenge even for the state-of-the-art long-read assemblers. To address this gap, we present the metaFlye assembler and demonstrate that it generates highly contiguous and accurate metagenome assemblies. In contrast to short-read metagenomics assemblers that typically fail to reconstruct full-length 16S RNA genes, metaFlye captures many 16S RNA genes within long contigs, thus providing new opportunities for analyzing the microbial “dark matter of life”. We also demonstrate that long-read metagenome assemblers significantly improve full-length plasmid and virus reconstruction as compared to short-read assemblers and reveal many novel plasmids and viruses.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Benchmarking Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Protocols for Cell Atlas Projects, bioRxiv, 2019-05-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is the leading technique for charting the molecular properties of individual cells. The latest methods are scalable to thousands of cells, enabling in-depth characterization of sample composition without prior knowledge. However, there are important differences between scRNA-seq techniques, and it remains unclear which are the most suitable protocols for drawing cell atlases of tissues, organs and organisms. We have generated benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate techniques in terms of their power to comprehensively describe cell types and states. We performed a multi-center study comparing 13 commonly used single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq protocols using a highly heterogeneous reference sample resource. Comparative and integrative analysis at cell type and state level revealed marked differences in protocol performance, highlighting a series of key features for cell atlas projects. These should be considered when defining guidelines and standards for international consortia, such as the Human Cell Atlas project.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Retinal outputs depend on behavioural state, bioRxiv, 2019-05-14</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe operating mode of the visual system depends on behavioural states such as arousal1,2. This dependence is seen both in primary visual cortex3–7 (V1) and in subcortical brain structures receiving direct retinal input4,8. Here we show that this effect arises as early as in the output of the retina. We first measured activity in a region that receives retinal projections9, the superficial superior colliculus (sSC), and found that this activity strongly depended on behavioural state. This modulation was not mediated by feedback inputs from V1 as it was immune to V1 inactivation. We then used Neuropixels probes10 to record activity in the optic tract, and we found some retinal axons whose activity significantly varied with arousal, even in darkness. To characterize these effects on a larger sample of retinal outputs, we imaged the activity of retinal boutons11,12 in sSC during behaviour using a calcium indicator. The activity of these boutons correlated with arousal as strongly as that of sSC neurons, and this correlation persisted also during darkness. These results reveal a novel property of retinal function in mice, which could be observed only during behaviour retinal outputs are modulated by behavioural state before they reach the rest of the brain.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">A large-scale resource for tissue-specific CRISPR mutagenesis in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2019-05-13</h4>
          <p>SUMMARYGenetic screens are powerful tools for the functional annotation of genomes. In the context of multicellular organisms, interrogation of gene function is greatly facilitated by methods that allow spatial and temporal control of gene abrogation. Here, we describe a large-scale transgenic short guide (sg) RNA library for efficient CRISPR-based disruption of specific target genes in a constitutive or conditional manner. The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1400 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption. Furthermore, we conducted the so far largest fully transgenic CRISPR screen in any metazoan organism, which further supported the high efficiency and accuracy of our library and revealed many so far uncharacterized genes essential for development.</p>
