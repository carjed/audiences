          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Long-read sequencing of nascent RNA reveals coupling among RNA processing events, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractPre-mRNA splicing is accomplished by the spliceosome, a megadalton complex that assembles de novo on each intron. Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur co-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing, due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products (mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here, we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent, multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Most multi-intron transcripts were fully spliced, consistent with rapid co-transcriptional splicing. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts were either fully spliced or fully unspliced, suggesting that splicing of any given intron is dependent on the splicing status of other introns in the transcript. Supporting this, mild inhibition of splicing by a temperature-sensitive mutation in Prp2, the homolog of vertebrate U2AF65, increased the frequency of fully unspliced transcripts. Importantly, fully unspliced transcripts displayed transcriptional read-through at the polyA site and were degraded co-transcriptionally by the nuclear exosome. Finally, we show that cellular mRNA levels were reduced in genes with a high number of unspliced nascent transcripts during caffeine treatment, showing regulatory significance of co-transcriptional splicing. Therefore, overall splicing of individual nascent transcripts, 3’ end formation, and mRNA half-life depend on the splicing status of neighboring introns, suggesting crosstalk among spliceosomes and the polyA cleavage machinery during transcription elongation.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Muscle specific stress fibers give rise to sarcomeres and are mechanistically distinct from stress fibers in non-muscle cells, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe sarcomere is the basic contractile unit within cardiomyocytes driving heart muscle contraction. We sought to test the mechanisms regulating thin (i.e., actin) and thick (i.e., myosin) filament assembly during sarcomere formation. Thus, we developed an assay using human cardiomyocytes to test de novo sarcomere assembly. Using this assay, we report a population of muscle-specific stress fibers are essential sarcomere precursors. We show sarcomeric actin filaments arise directly from these muscle stress fibers. This process requires formin-mediated but not Arp23-mediated actin polymerization and nonmuscle myosin IIB but not non-muscle myosin IIA. Furthermore, we show a short species of β cardiac myosin II filaments grows to form ~1.5 long filaments that then “stitch” together to form the stack of filaments at the core of the sarcomere (i.e., A-band). Interestingly, these are different from mechanisms that have previously been reported during stress fiber assembly in non-muscle cells. Thus, we provide a new model of cardiac sarcomere assembly based on distinct mechanisms of stress fiber regulation between non-muscle and muscle cells.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">High throughput single cell RNA-seq of developing mouse kidney and human kidney organoids reveals a roadmap for recreating the kidney, bioRxiv, 2017-12-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractRecent advances in our capacity to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to human kidney tissue are moving the field closer to novel approaches for renal replacement. Such protocols have relied upon our current understanding of the molecular basis of mammalian kidney morphogenesis. To date this has depended upon population based-profiling of non-homogenous cellular compartments. In order to improve our resolution of individual cell transcriptional profiles during kidney morphogenesis, we have performed 10x Chromium single cell RNA-seq on over 6000 cells from the E18.5 developing mouse kidney, as well as more than 7000 cells from human iPSC-derived kidney organoids. We identified 16 clusters of cells representing all major cell lineages in the E18.5 mouse kidney. The differentially expressed genes from individual murine clusters were then used to guide the classification of 16 cell clusters within human kidney organoids, revealing the presence of distinguishable stromal, endothelial, nephron, podocyte and nephron progenitor populations. Despite the congruence between developing mouse and human organoid, our analysis suggested limited nephron maturation and the presence of ‘off target’ populations in human kidney organoids, including unidentified stromal populations and evidence of neural clusters. This may reflect unique human kidney populations, mixed cultures or aberrant differentiation in vitro. Analysis of clusters within the mouse data revealed novel insights into progenitor maintenance and cellular maturation in the major renal lineages and will serve as a roadmap to refine directed differentiation approaches in human iPSC-derived kidney organoids.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Performance Assessment and Selection of Normalization Procedures for Single-Cell RNA-seq, bioRxiv, 2017-12-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractSystematic measurement biases make data normalization an essential preprocessing step in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. There may be multiple, competing considerations behind the assessment of normalization performance, some of them study-specific. Because normalization can have a large impact on downstream results (e.g., clustering and differential expression), it is critically important that practitioners assess the performance of competing methods.We have developed scone — a flexible framework for assessing normalization performance based on a comprehensive panel of data-driven metrics. Through graphical summaries and quantitative reports, scone summarizes performance trade-offs and ranks large numbers of normalization methods by aggregate panel performance. The method is implemented in the open-source Bioconductor R software package scone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scone on a collection of scRNA-seq datasets, generated with different protocols, including Fluidigm C1 and 10x platforms. We show that top-performing normalization methods lead to better agreement with independent validation data.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Phylofactorization a graph-partitioning algorithm to identify phylogenetic scales of ecological data, bioRxiv, 2017-12-17</h4>
          <p>AbstractThe problem of pattern and scale is a central challenge in ecology. The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of “nitrogen fixing trees” into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.The phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.Generalizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts. We finish with a discussion of how phylofac-torization produces an ecological species concept with a phylogenetic constraint. All of these tools can be implemented with a new R package available online.</p>

          <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Amplicon sequencing of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA operon with long-read technology for improved phylogenetic classification of uncultured prokaryotes, bioRxiv, 2017-12-16</h4>
          <p>AbstractAmplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions of environmental samples and to discover previously unknown lineages. Its unique structure of interspersed conserved and variable regions is an excellent target for PCR and allows for classification of reads at all taxonomic levels. However, the relatively few phylogenetically informative sites prevent confident phylogenetic placements of novel lineages that are deep branching relative to reference taxa. This problem is exacerbated when only short 16S rRNA gene fragments are sequenced. To resolve their placement, it is common practice to gather more informative sites by combining multiple conserved genes into concatenated datasets. This however requires genomic data which may be obtained through relatively expensive metagenome sequencing and computationally demanding analyses. Here we develop a protocol that amplifies a large part of 16S and 23S rRNA genes within the rRNA operon, including the ITS region, and sequences the amplicons with PacBio long-read technology. We tested our method with a synthetic mock community and developed a read curation pipeline that reduces the overall error rate to 0.18%. Applying our method on four diverse environmental samples, we were able to capture near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. Phylogenetic trees constructed with these sequences showed an increase in statistical support compared to trees inferred with shorter, Illumina-like sequences using only the 16S rRNA gene (250 bp). Our method is a cost-effective solution to generate high quality, near full-length 16S and 23S rRNA gene sequences from environmental prokaryotes.</p>
