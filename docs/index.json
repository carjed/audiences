Moreover, little is known about how such preferences are actually constructed in the brain. Here we developed and tested a computational framework to gain an understanding of how the human brain constructs aesthetic value. We show that it is possible to explain human preferences for a piece of art based on an analysis of features present in the image. This was achieved by analyzing the visual properties of drawings and photographs by multiple means, ranging from image statistics extracted by computer vision tools, subjective human ratings about attributes, to a deep convolutional neural network. Crucially, it is possible to predict subjective value ratings not only within but also across individuals, speaking to the possibility that much of the variance in human visual preference is shared across individuals. Neuroimaging data revealed that preference computations occur in the brain by means of a graded hierarchical representation of lower and higher level features in the visual system. These features are in turn integrated to compute an overall subjective preference in the parietal and prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that rather than being idiosyncratic, human preferences for art can be explained at least in part as a product of a systematic neural integration over underlying visual features of an image. This work not only advances our understanding of the brain-wide computations underlying value construction but also brings new mechanistic insights to the study of visual aesthetics and art appreciation.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Aesthetic preference for art emerges from a weighted integration over hierarchically structured visual features in the brain, bioRxiv, 2020-02-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/aesthetic_preference_for_art_emerges_from_a_weighted_integration_over_hierarchically_structured_visual_features_in_the_brain_75739737/"},{"date":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractReal-time selective sequencing of individual DNA fragments, or ‘Read Until’, allows the focusing of Oxford Nanopore Technology sequencing on pre-selected genomic regions. This can lead to large improvements in DNA sequencing performance in many scenarios where only part of the DNA content of a sample is of interest. This approach is based on the idea of deciding whether to sequence a fragment completely after having sequenced only a small initial part of it. If, based on this small part, the fragment is not deemed of (sufficient) interest it is rejected and sequencing is continued on a new fragment. To date, only simple decision strategies based on location within a genome have been proposed to determine what fragments are of interest. We present a new mathematical model and algorithm for the real-time assessment of the value of prospective fragments. Our decision framework is based not only on which genomic regions are a priori interesting, but also on which fragments have so far been sequenced, and so on the current information available regarding the genome being sequenced. As such, our strategy can adapt dynamically during each run, focusing sequencing efforts in areas of highest uncertainty (typically areas currently low coverage). We show that our approach can lead to considerable savings of time and materials, providing high-confidence genome reconstruction sooner than a standard sequencing run, and resulting in more homogeneous coverage across the genome, even when entire genomes are of interest.Author SummaryAn existing technique called ‘Read Until’ allows selective sequencing of DNA fragments with an Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencer. With Read Until it is possible to enrich coverage of areas of interest within a sequenced genome. We propose a new use of this technique combining a mathematical model of read utility and an algorithm to select an optimal dynamic decision strategy (i.e. one that can be updated in real time, and so react to the data generated so far in an experiment), we show that it possible to improve the efficiency of a sequencing run by focusing effort on areas of highest uncertainty.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"BOSS-RUNS a flexible and practical dynamic read sampling framework for nanopore sequencing, bioRxiv, 2020-02-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/boss-runs_a_flexible_and_practical_dynamic_read_sampling_framework_for_nanopore_sequencing_75419138/"},{"date":"2020-02-08T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryOne of the pervasive features of cancer is the diversity of mutations found in malignant cells within the same tumor; a phenomenon called clonal diversity or intratumor heterogeneity. Clonal diversity allows tumors to adapt to the selective pressure of treatment and likely contributes to the development of treatment resistance and cancer recurrence. Thus, the ability to precisely delineate the clonal substructure of a tumor, including the evolutionary history of its development and the co-occurrence of its mutations, is necessary to understand and overcome treatment resistance. However, DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples cannot accurately resolve complex clonal architectures. Here, we performed high-throughput single-cell DNA sequencing to quantitatively assess the clonal architecture of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sequenced a total of 556,951 cells from 77 patients with AML for 19 genes known to be recurrently mutated in AML. The data revealed clonal relationship among AML driver mutations and identified mutations that often co-occurred (e.g., NPM1FLT3-ITD, DNMT3ANPM1, SRSF2IDH2, and WT1FLT3-ITD) and those that were mutually exclusive (e.g., NRASKRAS, FLT3-D835ITD, and IDH1IDH2) at single-cell resolution. Reconstruction of the tumor phylogeny uncovered history of tumor development that is characterized by linear and branching clonal evolution patterns with latter involving functional convergence of separately evolved clones. Analysis of longitudinal samples revealed remodeling of clonal architecture in response to therapeutic pressure that is driven by clonal selection. Furthermore, in this AML cohort, higher clonal diversity (≥4 subclones) was associated with significantly worse overall survival. These data portray clonal relationship, architecture, and evolution of AML driver genes with unprecedented resolution, and illuminate the role of clonal diversity in therapeutic resistance, relapse and clinical outcome in AML.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Clonal Evolution of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Revealed by High-Throughput Single-Cell Genomics, bioRxiv, 2020-02-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/clonal_evolution_of_acute_myeloid_leukemia_revealed_by_high-throughput_single-cell_genomics_75412873/"},{"date":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTImages of micron-scale domains in lipid bilayers have provided the gold standard of model-free evidence to understand the domains’ shapes, sizes, and distributions. Corresponding techniques to directly and quantitatively assess smaller (nanoscale and submicron) liquid domains have been lacking, leading to an inability to answer key questions. For example, researchers commonly seek to correlate activities of membrane proteins with attributes of the domains in which they reside; doing so hinges on identification and characterization of membrane domains. Although some features of membrane domains can be probed by indirect methods, these methods are often constrained by the limitation that data must be analyzed in the context of models that require multiple assumptions or parameters. Here, we address this challenge by developing and testing two new methods of identifying submicron domains in biomimetic membranes. Both methods leverage cryo-electron tomograms of ternary membranes under native solution conditions. The first method is optimized for probe-free applications domains are directly distinguished from the surrounding membrane by their thickness. This technique measures area fractions of domains with quantitative accuracy, in excellent agreement with known phase diagrams. The second method is optimized for applications in which a single label is deployed for imaging membranes by both high-resolution cryo-electron tomography and diffraction-limited optical microscopy. For this method, we test a panel of probes, find that a trimeric mCherry label performs best, and specify criteria for developing future high-performance, dual-use probes. These developments have led to the first direct and quantitative imaging of submicron membrane domains under native conditions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTFluorescence micrographs that capture the sizes, shapes, and distributions of liquid domains in model membranes have provided high standards of evidence to prove (and disprove) theories of how micron-scale domains form and grow. Corresponding theories about smaller domains have remained untested, partly because experimental methods of identifying submicron domains in vesicles under native solvent conditions have not been available. Here we introduce two such methods. Both leverage cryo-electron tomography to observe membrane features far smaller than the diffraction limit of light. The first method is probe-free and identifies differences in thicknesses between liquid domains and their surrounding membranes. The second method identifies membrane regions labeled by an electron-dense, fluorescent protein, which enables direct comparison of fluorescence micrographs with cryo-electron tomograms.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","100-200-users","2020"],"title":"Direct Imaging of Liquid Domains in Membranes by Cryo Electron Tomography, bioRxiv, 2020-02-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/direct_imaging_of_liquid_domains_in_membranes_by_cryo_electron_tomography_75079476/"},{"date":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTThe nanoscale organization of biological membranes into structurally and compositionally distinct lateral domains is believed to be central to membrane function. The nature of this organization has remained elusive due to a lack of methods to directly probe nanoscopic membrane features. We show here that cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) can be used to directly image coexisting nanoscopic domains in synthetic and bio-derived membranes without extrinsic probes. Analyzing a series of single-component liposomes composed of synthetic lipids of varying lengths, we demonstrate that cryoEM can distinguish bilayer thickness differences as small as 0.5 Å, comparable to the resolution of small-angle scattering methods. Simulated images from computational models reveal that features in cryoEM images result from a complex interplay between the atomic distribution normal to the plane of the bilayer and imaging parameters. Simulations of phase separated bilayers were used to predict two sources of contrast between coexisting ordered and disordered phases within a single liposome, namely differences in membrane thickness and molecular density. We observe both sources of contrast in biomimetic membranes composed of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol. When extended to isolated mammalian plasma membranes, these methods reveal similar nanoscale lateral heterogeneities. The methods reported here for direct, probe-free imaging of nanodomains in unperturbed membranes open new avenues for investigation of nanoscopic membrane organization.SIGNIFICANCEWe have used cryoEM to achieve direct, probe-free imaging of lateral domains in biomimetic lipid membranes under native conditions and to characterize differences in their structures. First, measurements of membrane thickness in laterally uniform single-component membranes show that cryoEM is capable of sub-angstrom resolution of interleaflet membrane thickness. All-atom simulations are used to predict the cryo-EM appearance of submicron domains in vesicles with coexisting liquid domains and these are quantitatively validated by direct imaging of phase separated membranes.

In this study, we used our pretrained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd \u0026lt; 1000 nM.

Broadly, we found significant variability in the performance of the methods across evaluation settings.

Here, we document the usefulness of reduced-representation sequencing data (RAD-seq) to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs accounts for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs for which no association was found, genetic-environment association revealed that 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal than SNPs.

This knowledge is a primary step in the intent of deciphering the specific genetic bases of diseases and drug response in the country. Similarly to other populations across the Americas, genetic ancestry in Argentinean populations traces back into African, European and Native American ancestors, reflecting a complex demographic history with multiple migration and admixture events in pre- and post-colonial times. However, little is known about the sub-continental origins of these three main ancestries. We present new high-throughput genotyping data for 87 admixed individuals across Argentina. This data was combined to previously published data for admixed individuals in the region and then compared to different reference panels specifically built to run population structure analyses at a sub-continental level. Concerning the European and African ancestries, we confirmed previous results about their main origins, and we provide new insights into the presence of other origins that reflect historical records. As for the Native American ancestry, leveraging genotype data for archaeological samples in the region in order to gain temporal depth in our analyses, we could identify four Native American components segregating in modern Argentinean populations. Three of them are also found in modern South American populations and are specifically represented in Central ChilePatagonia, Lowlands and Central Andes geographic areas. The fourth one may be specific to the Central Western region of Argentina.Identifying such component has not been straightforward since it is not well represented in any genomic data from the literature.

During colonial period, the slave trade also prompted many African people to move to Argentina. Little is known about the origins of the Native American and African components in Argentinean populations nowadays.Genotyping data for 87 admixed individuals throughout Argentina was generated and data from the literature was re-analyzed to shed light on this question. We confirmed that most of the European genetic ancestry comes from the South, although several individuals are related to Northern Europeans. We found that African origins in Argentina trace back from different regions. As for the Native American ancestry, we identified that it can be divided into four main components that correspond to Central ChilePatagonia, Lowlands, Central Andes and Central Western region of Argentina.

Here we introduce a machine learning-guided paradigm that can use as few as 24 functionally assayed mutant sequences to build an accurate virtual fitness landscape and screen ten million sequences via in silico directed evolution. As demonstrated in two highly dissimilar proteins, avGFP and TEM-1 β-lactamase, top candidates from a single round are diverse and as active as engineered mutants obtained from previous multi-year, high-throughput efforts.

With reproducible \u0026gt;500% improvements in activity from a single assay in a 96-well plate, we demonstrate the strongest generalization observed in machine-learning guided protein design to date.

In an increasingly wide array of settings, these predicted outcomes are used in subsequent statistical analysis, often without accounting for the distinction between observed and predicted outcomes [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. We call inference with predicted outcomes post-prediction inference. In this paper, we develop methods for correcting statistical inference using outcomes predicted with an arbitrary machine learning method. Rather than trying to derive the correction from the first principles for each machine learning tool, we make the observation that there is typically a low-dimensional and easily modeled representation of the relationship between the observed and predicted outcomes. We build an approach for the post-prediction inference that naturally fits into the standard machine learning framework. We estimate the relationship between the observed and predicted outcomes on the testing set and use that model to correct inference on the validation set and subsequent statistical models. We show our postpi approach can correct bias and improve variance estimation (and thus subsequent statistical inference) with predicted outcome data. To show the broad range of applicability of our approach, we show postpi can improve inference in two totally distinct fields modeling predicted phenotypes in repurposed gene expression data [10] and modeling predicted causes of death in verbal autopsy data [11].

Here, we leveraged a whole adult brain electron microscopy volume to study the circuitry associated with antennal thermosensory and hygrosensory neurons, which target specific ventroposterior (VP) glomeruli in the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe. We have identified two new VP glomeruli, in addition to the five known ones, and the projection neurons (VP PNs) that relay VP information to higher brain centres, including the mushroom body and lateral horn, seats of learned and innate olfactory behaviours, respectively. Focussing on the mushroom body lateral accessory calyx (lACA), a known thermosensory neuropil, we present a comprehensive connectome by reconstructing neurons downstream of heating- and cooling-responsive VP PNs. We find that a few lACA-associated mushroom body intrinsic neurons (Kenyon cells) solely receive thermosensory inputs, while most receive additional olfactory and thermo- or hygrosensory PN inputs in the main calyx. Unexpectedly, we find several classes of lACA-associated neurons that form a local network with outputs to other brain neuropils, suggesting that the lACA serves as a general hub for thermosensory circuitry. For example, we find DN1 pacemaker neurons that link the lACA to the accessory medulla, likely mediating temperature-based entrainment of the circadian clock. Finally, we survey strongly connected downstream partners of VP PNs across the protocerebrum; these include a descending neuron that receives input mainly from dry-responsive VP PNs, meaning that just two synapses might separate hygrosensory inputs from motor neurons in the nerve cord.

Cell loss is dose dependent and nearly complete at experimentally relevant viral titers. rAAV-induced cell death is rapid and persistent, with loss of BrdU-labeled cells within 18 hours post-injection and no evidence of recovery of adult neurogenesis at 3 months post-injection. The remaining mature DGCs appear hyperactive 4 weeks post-injection based on immediate early gene expression, consistent with previous studies investigating the effects of attenuating adult neurogenesis. In vitro application of AAV or electroporation of AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) is sufficient to induce cell death. Efficient transduction of the dentate gyrus (DG)—without ablating adult neurogenesis—can be achieved by injection of rAAV2-retro serotyped virus into CA3. rAAV2-retro results in efficient retrograde labeling of mature DGCs and permits in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of dentate activity while leaving adult neurogenesis intact.

Fortunately, some of the root causes are known and can be addressed by scientists and authors alike. After careful consideration of the available literature, the National Institutes of Health identified several key problems with the way that scientists conduct and report their research and introduced guidelines to improve the rigor and reproducibility of pre-clinical studies. Many journals have implemented policies addressing these same criteria. We currently have, however, no comprehensive data on how these guidelines are impacting the reporting of research. Using SciScore, an automated tool developed to review the methods sections of manuscripts for the presence of criteria associated with the NIH and other reporting guidelines, e.g., ARRIVE, RRIDs, we have analyzed ∼1.6 million PubMed Central papers to determine the degree to which articles were addressing these criteria. The tool scores each paper on a ten point scale identifying sentences that are associated with compliance with criteria associated with increased rigor (5 pts) and those associated with key resource identification and authentication (5 pts). From these data, we have built the Rigor and Transparency Index, which is the average score for analyzed papers in a particular journal. Our analyses show that the average score over all journals has increased since 1997, but remains below five, indicating that less than half of the rigor and reproducibility criteria are routinely addressed by authors. To analyze the data further, we examined the prevalence of individual criteria across the literature, e.g., the reporting of a subject’s sex (21-37% of studies between 1997 and 2019), the inclusion of sample size calculations (2-10%), whether the study addressed blinding (3-9%), or the identifiability of key biological resources such as antibodies (11-43%), transgenic organisms (14-22%), and cell lines (33-39%). The greatest increase in prevalence for rigor criteria was seen in the use of randomization of subjects (10-30%), while software tool identifiability improved the most among key resource types (42-87%). We further analyzed individual journals over time that had implemented specific author guidelines covering rigor criteria, and found that in some journals, they had a big impact, whereas in others they did not. We speculate that unless they are enforced, author guidelines alone do little to improve the number of criteria addressed by authors. Our Rigor and Transparency Index did not correlate with the impact factors of journals.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Rigor and Transparency Index, a new metric of quality for assessing biological and medical science methods, bioRxiv, 2020-01-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rigor_and_transparency_index_a_new_metric_of_quality_for_assessing_biological_and_medical_science_methods_74219181/"},{"date":"2020-01-19T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTCells have evolved specialized protein disaggregases to reverse toxic protein aggregation and restore protein functionality.

The Skd3 ankyrin-repeat domain combines with conserved AAA+ elements to enable stand-alone disaggregase activity.

Indeed, PARL-activated Skd3 dissolves α-synuclein fibrils connected to Parkinson’s disease. Human cells lacking Skd3 exhibit reduced solubility of various mitochondrial proteins, including anti-apoptotic Hax1. Importantly, Skd3 variants linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a severe mitochondrial disorder, display diminished disaggregase activity (but not always reduced ATPase activity), which predicts disease severity.

However, the analytical technologies available to study cellular metabolism lack single-cell resolution, obscuring metabolic heterogeneity and its connection to immune phenotype and function. To that end, we utilized high-dimensional, antibody-based technologies to simultaneously quantify the single-cell metabolic regulome in combination with phenotypic identity. Mass cytometry (CyTOF)-based application of this approach to early human T cell activation enabled the comprehensive reconstruction of the coordinated metabolic remodeling of naïve CD8+ T cells and aligned with conventional bulk assays for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Extending this analysis to a variety of tissue-resident immune cells revealed tissue-restricted metabolic states of human cytotoxic T cells, including metabolically repressed subsets that expressed CD39 and PD1 and that were enriched in colorectal carcinoma versus healthy adjacent tissue. Finally, combining this approach with multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) demonstrated the existence of spatially enriched metabolic neighborhoods, independent of cell identity and additionally revealed exclusion of metabolically repressed cytotoxic T cell states from the tumor-immune boundary in human colorectal carcinoma. Overall, we provide an approach that permits the robust approximation of metabolic states in individual cells along with multimodal analysis of cell identity and functional characteristics that can be applied to human clinical samples to study cellular metabolism how it may be perturbed to affect immunological outcomes.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","100-200-users","2020"],"title":"Multiplexed Single-cell Metabolic Profiles Organize the Spectrum of Cytotoxic Human T Cells, bioRxiv, 2020-01-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/multiplexed_single-cell_metabolic_profiles_organize_the_spectrum_of_cytotoxic_human_t_cells_74169828/"},{"date":"2020-01-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractTo identify the neural correlates of perceptual awareness, researchers often compare the differences in neural activation between conditions in which an observer is or is not aware of a target stimulus. While intuitive, this approach often contains a critical limitation In order to link brain activity with perceptual awareness, observers traditionally report the contents of their perceptual experience. However, relying on observers’ reports is problematic because it makes it difficult to know if the neural responses being measured are associated with conscious perception per se or with post-perceptual processes involved in the reporting task (i.e., working memory, decision-making, etc.). To address this issue, we combined a standard visual masking paradigm with a recently developed “no-report” paradigm. In the visual masking paradigm, observers saw images of animals and objects that were visible or invisible depending on their proximity to masks. Meanwhile, on half of the trials, observers reported the contents of their perceptual experience (i.e., report condition), while on the other half of trials they refrained from reporting about their experiences (i.e., no-report condition). We used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine how visibility interacts with reporting by measuring the P3b event related potential (ERP), one of the proposed canonical “signatures” of conscious processing. Overall, we found a robust P3b in the report condition, but no P3b whatsoever in the no-report condition. This finding suggests that the P3b itself is not a neural signature of conscious processing and highlights the importance of carefully distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness from post-perceptual processing.Significance statementWhat are the neural signatures that differentiate conscious and unconscious processing in the brain? Perhaps the most well-established candidate signature is the P3b event-related potential (ERP), a late slow wave that appears when observers are aware of a stimulus, but disappears when a stimulus fails to reach awareness. Here, however, we found that the P3b does not track what observers are perceiving but instead tracks what observers are reporting. When observers are aware of simple visual stimuli, the P3b is nowhere to be found unless observers are reporting the contents of their experience. These results challenge the well-established notion of the P3b as a neural marker of awareness and highlight the need for new approaches to the neuroscience of consciousness.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Distinguishing the neural correlates of perceptual awareness and post-perceptual processing, bioRxiv, 2020-01-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/distinguishing_the_neural_correlates_of_perceptual_awareness_and_post-perceptual_processing_74118318/"},{"date":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractEducational attainment (EA) is influenced by cognitive abilities and by other characteristics and traits.

Here, we report that ER remodeling is actively driven by lysosomes, following lysosome repositioning in response to changes in nutritional status. The anchorage of lysosomes to ER growth tips is critical for ER tubule elongation and connection. We validate this causal link via the chemo- and optogenetically driven re-positioning of lysosomes, which leads to both a redistribution of the ER tubules and its global morphology. Lysosomes sense metabolic change in the cell and regulate ER tubule distribution accordingly. Dysfunction in this mechanism during axonal extension may lead to axonal growth defects.

Here, we develop a new theory to predict the relative accuracy (RA, relative to the accuracy in populations of the same ancestry as the discovery population) of PGS across ancestries. We used simulations and real data from the UK Biobank to evaluate our results. We found across various simulation scenarios that the RA of PGS based on trait-associated SNPs can be predicted accurately from modelling linkage disequilibrium (LD), minor allele frequencies (MAF), cross-population correlations of SNP effect sizes and heritability. Altogether, we find that LD and MAF differences between ancestries explain alone up to ~70% of the loss of RA using European-based PGS in African ancestry for traits like body mass index and height.

We then combined newly generated mitochondrial DNA sequence data with published datasets to create a comparative phylogeographic dataset for 37 independent tetrapod lineages. We reconstructed time-calibrated molecular phylogenies for each lineage under Bayesian inference to estimate divergence times between lineages located East and West of the Andes. We performed a comparative phylogeographic analysis of all lineages within each class of tetrapod using hierarchical approximate Bayesian computation (hABC) to test for synchronous vicariance across the EC-MA. To evaluate the potential role of life history in explaining variation in divergence times among lineages, we evaluated 13 general linear models (GLM) containing up to six variables each (maximum elevation, range size, body length, thermoregulation, type of dispersal, and taxonomic class).ResultsOur synthesis of geological evidence suggested that the EC-MA reached significant heights by 38–33 million years ago (Ma) along most of its length, and we reject the oft-cited date of 2–5 Ma. Based on mtDNA divergence from 37 lineages, however, the median estimated divergence time across the EC-MA was 3.26 Ma (SE = 2.84) in amphibians, 2.58 Ma (SE = 1.81) in birds, 2.99 Ma (SE = 4.68) in reptiles and 1.43 Ma (SE = 1.23) in mammals. Using Bayes Factors, the hypothesis for a single temporal divergence interval containing synchronous divergence events was supported for mammals and but not supported for amphibians, non-avian reptiles, or birds.

In the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, mini-chromosomes have been first described in the early 1990s but, until very recently, have been overlooked in genomic studies. Here we investigated structural variation in four isolates of the blast fungus M. oryzae from different grass hosts and analyzed the sequences of mini-chromosomes in the rice, foxtail millet and goosegrass isolates. The mini-chromosomes of these isolates turned out to be highly diverse with distinct sequence composition. They are enriched in repetitive elements and have lower gene density than core-chromosomes. We identified several virulence-related genes in the mini-chromosome of the rice isolate, including the polyketide synthase Ace1 and the effector gene AVR-Pik. Macrosynteny analyses around these loci revealed structural rearrangements, including inter-chromosomal translocations between core- and mini-chromosomes. Our findings provide evidence that mini-chromosomes independently emerge from structural rearrangements of core-chromosomes and might contribute to adaptive evolution of the blast fungus.Author summaryThe genomes of plant pathogens often exhibit an architecture that facilitates high rates of dynamic rearrangements and genetic diversification in virulence associated regions. These regions, which tend to be gene sparse and repeat rich, are thought to serve as a cradle for adaptive evolution. Supernumerary chromosomes, i.e. chromosomes that are only present in some but not all individuals of a species, are a special type of structural variation that have been observed in plants, animals, and fungi. Here we identified and studied supernumerary mini-chromosomes in the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, a pathogen that causes some of the most destructive plant diseases. We found that rice, foxtail millet and goosegrass isolates of this pathogen contain mini-chromosomes with distinct sequence composition. All mini-chromosomes are rich in repetitive genetic elements and have lower gene densities than core-chromosomes. Further, we identified virulence-related genes on the mini-chromosome of the rice isolate. We observed large-scale genomic rearrangements around these loci, indicative of a role of mini-chromosomes in facilitating genome dynamics.

However, the high-throughput analysis of thousands of single cell transcriptomes has been limited by sample preparation and sequencing technology. High-throughput single cell analysis today is facilitated by protocols like the 10X Genomics platform or Drop-Seq which generate cDNA pools in which the origin of a transcript is encoded at its 5’ or 3’ end. These cDNA pools are currently analyzed by short read Illumina sequencing which can identify the cellular origin of a transcript and what gene it was transcribed from. However, these methods fail to retrieve isoform information. In principle, cDNA pools prepared using these approaches can be analyzed with Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencers to retrieve isoform information but all current implementations rely heavily on Illumina short-reads for the analysis in addition to long reads. Here, we used R2C2 to sequence and demultiplex 9 million full-length cDNA molecules generated by the 10X Chromium platform from ∼3000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We used these reads to – independent from Illumina data – cluster cells into B cells, T cells, and Monocytes and generate isoform-level transcriptomes for these cell-types.

Despite this well-known collateral damage, the activity spectrum of the different antibiotic classes on gut bacteria remains poorly characterized. Having monitored the activities of \u0026gt;1,000 marketed drugs on 38 representative species of the healthy human gut microbiome4, we here characterize further the 144 antibiotics therein, representing all major classes. We determined \u0026gt;800 Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) and extended the antibiotic profiling to 10 additional species to validate these results and link to available data on antibiotic breakpoints for gut microbes. Antibiotic classes exhibited distinct inhibition spectra, including generation-dependent effects by quinolones and phylogeny-independence by β-lactams. Macrolides and tetracyclines, two prototypic classes of bacteriostatic protein synthesis inhibitors, inhibited almost all commensals tested. We established that both kill different subsets of prevalent commensal bacteria, and cause cell lysis in specific cases. This species-specific activity challenges the long-standing divide of antibiotics into bactericidal and bacteriostatic, and provides a possible explanation for the strong impact of macrolides on the gut microbiota composition in animals5-8 and humans9-11. To mitigate the collateral damage of macrolides and tetracyclines on gut commensals, we exploited the fact that drug combinations have species-specific outcomes in bacteria12 and sought marketed drugs, which could antagonize the activity of these antibiotics in abundant gut commensal species. By screening \u0026gt;1,000 drugs, we identified several such antidotes capable of protecting gut species from these antibiotics without compromising their activity against relevant pathogens. Altogether, this study broadens our understanding of antibiotic action on gut commensals, uncovers a previously unappreciated and broad bactericidal effect of prototypical bacteriostatic antibiotics on gut bacteria, and opens avenues for preventing the collateral damage caused by antibiotics on human gut commensals.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2020"],"title":"Dissecting the collateral damage of antibiotics on gut microbes, bioRxiv, 2020-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/dissecting_the_collateral_damage_of_antibiotics_on_gut_microbes_73812213/"},{"date":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTViruses use IRES sequences within their RNA to hijack translation machinery and thereby rapidly replicate in host cells. While this process has been extensively studied in bulk assays, the dynamics of hijacking at the single-molecule level remain unexplored in living cells. To achieve this, we developed a bicistronic biosensor encoding complementary repeat epitopes in two ORFs, one translated in a Cap-dependent manner and the other translated in an IRES-mediated manner. Using a pair of complementary probes that bind the epitopes co-translationally, our biosensor lights up in different colors depending on which ORF is being translated. In combination with single-molecule tracking and computational modeling, we measured the relative kinetics of Cap versus IRES translation and show (1) Two non-overlapping ORFs can be simultaneously translated within a single mRNA; (2) EMCV IRES-mediated translation sites recruit ribosomes less efficiently than Cap-dependent translation sites but are otherwise nearly indistinguishable, having similar mobilities, sizes, spatial distributions, and ribosomal initiation and elongation rates; (3) Both Cap-dependent and IRES-mediated ribosomes tend to stretch out translation sites; (4) Although the IRES recruits two to three times fewer ribosomes than the Cap in normal conditions, the balance shifts dramatically in favor of the IRES during oxidative and ER stresses that mimic viral infection; and (5) Translation of the IRES is enhanced by translation of the Cap, demonstrating upstream translation can positively impact the downstream translation of a non-overlapping ORF. With the ability to simultaneously quantify two distinct translation mechanisms in physiologically relevant live-cell environments, we anticipate bicistronic biosensors like the one we developed here will become powerful new tools to dissect both canonical and non-canonical translation dynamics with single-molecule precision.Graphical Abstract\u003cjatsfig id=ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait fig-type=figure\u003e\u003cjatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=900829v1_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait \u003e","tags":["biorxiv","biochemistry","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Quantifying the spatiotemporal dynamics of IRES versus Cap translation with single-molecule resolution in living cells, bioRxiv, 2020-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/quantifying_the_spatiotemporal_dynamics_of_ires_versus_cap_translation_with_single-molecule_resolution_in_living_cells_73809213/"},{"date":"2020-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundUnderstanding the mechanisms and timescales of plant pathogen outbreaks requires a detailed genome-scale analysis of their population history. The fungus Magnaporthe (Syn. Pyricularia) oryzae —the causal agent of blast disease of cereals— is among the most destructive plant pathogens to world agriculture and a major threat to the production of rice, wheat and other cereals. Although M. oryzae is a multihost pathogen that infects more than 50 species of cereals and grasses, all rice-infecting isolates belong to a single genetically defined lineage. Here, we combined multiple genomics datasets to reconstruct the genetic history of the rice-infecting lineage of M. oryzae based on 131 isolates from 21 countries.ResultsThe global population of the rice blast fungus consists of a diverse set of individuals and three well-defined genetic groups. Multiple population genetic tests revealed that the rice-infecting lineage of the blast fungus probably originated from a recombining diverse group in South East Asia followed by three independent clonal expansions that took place over the last ∼200 years. Patterns of allele sharing identified a subpopulation from the recombining diverse group that introgressed with one of the clonal lineages before its global expansion. Remarkably, the four genetic lineages of the rice blast fungus vary in the number and patterns of presenceabsence of candidate effector genes. In particular, clonal lineages carry a reduced repertoire of effector genes compared with the diverse group, and specific combinations of effector presenceabsence define each of the pandemic clonal lineages.ConclusionsOur analyses reconstruct the genetic history of the rice-infecting lineage of M. oryzae revealing three clonal lineages associated with rice blast pandemics. Each of these lineages displays a specific pattern of presenceabsence of effector genes that may have shaped their adaptation to the rice host and their evolutionary history.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2020"],"title":"Recently expanded clonal lineages of the rice blast fungus display distinct patterns of presenceabsence of effector genes, bioRxiv, 2020-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/recently_expanded_clonal_lineages_of_the_rice_blast_fungus_display_distinct_patterns_of_presenceabsence_of_effector_genes_73855112/"},{"date":"2020-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractNeisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent public health threat due to rapidly increasing incidence and antibiotic resistance. In contrast with the trend of increasing resistance, clinical isolates that have reverted to susceptibility regularly appear, prompting questions about which pressures compete with antibiotics to shape gonococcal evolution. Here, we used genome-wide association on the largest collection of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to date (n=4882) to identify loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the efflux pump mtrCDE operon as a mechanism of increased antibiotic susceptibility and demonstrate that these mutations are overrepresented in cervical isolates relative to urethral isolates (odds ratio (OR) = 3.74, 95% CI [1.98-6.70]). In support of a model in which pump expression incurs a fitness cost in this niche, cervical isolates were also enriched relative to urethral isolates in LOF mutations in the mtrCDE activator mtrA (OR = 8.60, 95% CI [4.96-14.57]) and in farA, a subunit of the FarAB efflux pump (OR = 6.25, 95% CI [3.90-9.83]).

One of the most commonly used commercial kits for rRNA depletion, the Ribo-Zero kit from Illumina, was recently discontinued. Here, we report the development a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for depleting rRNA that can be easily implemented by any lab or facility. We first developed an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize tightly and specifically to the 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs from any species of interest. Precipitation of these oligonucleotides bound to rRNA by magnetic streptavidin beads then depletes rRNA from a complex, total RNA sample such that ~75-80% of reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment derive from mRNA. Importantly, we demonstrate a high correlation of RNA abundance or fold-change measurements in RNA-seq experiments between our method and the previously available Ribo-Zero kit.

This method reduced intentionally contaminating bacterial, viral, and free DNA to background levels in artificial-ice-core control experiments, and was then applied to two authentic ice cores to profile their microbes and viruses. The microbes differed significantly across the two ice cores, presumably representing the very different climate conditions at the time of deposition that is similar to findings in other cores. Separately, viral particle enrichment and ultra-low-input quantitative viral metagenomic sequencing from ∼520 and ∼15,000 years old ice revealed 33 viral populations (i.e., species-level designations) that represented four known genera and likely 28 novel viral genera (assessed by gene-sharing networks). In silico host predictions linked 18 of the 33 viral populations to co-occurring abundant bacteria, including Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Janthinobacterium, indicating that viruses infected several abundant microbial groups.

Previous cortical studies modeled a continuum of synapse sizes (Arellano et al., 2007) by a log-normal distribution (Loewenstein, Kuras and Rumpel, 2011; de Vivo et al., 2017; Santuy et al., 2018). A continuum is consistent with most neural network models of learning, in which synaptic strength is a continuously graded analog variable. Here we show that synapse size, when restricted to synapses between L23 pyramidal cells, is well-modeled by the sum of a binary variable and an analog variable drawn from a log-normal distribution. Two synapses sharing the same presynaptic and postsynaptic cells are known to be correlated in size (Sorra and Harris, 1993; Koester and Johnston, 2005; Bartol et al., 2015; Kasthuri et al., 2015; Dvorkin and Ziv, 2016; Bloss et al., 2018; Motta et al., 2019). We show that the binary variables of the two synapses are highly correlated, while the analog variables are not.

We hypothesized that immunological disruption is the major driver of this disease and analyzed a large cohort of MECFS patient or control blood samples for differences in T cell subset frequencies and functions. We found that the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells and the proportion of CD8+ effector memory T cells were increased, whereas NK cells were reduced in MECFS patients younger than 50 years old compared to a healthy control group. Remarkably, major differences were observed in Th1, Th2, Th17 and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) T cell subset functions across all ages of patients compared to healthy subjects. While CCR6+ Th17 cells in MECFS secreted less IL-17 compared to controls, their overall frequency was higher. Similarly, MAIT cells from patients secreted lower IFNγ, GranzymeA and IL-17 upon activation. Together, these findings suggest chronic stimulation of these T cell populations in MECFS patients. In contrast, the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which control excessive immune activation, was higher in MECFS patients. Finally, using a machine learning algorithm called random forest, we determined that the set of T cell parameters analyzed could identify more than 90% of the subjects in the MECFS cohort as patients (93% true positive rate or sensitivity). In conclusion, these multiple and major perturbations or dysfunctions in T cell subsets in MECFS patients suggest potential chronic infections or microbiome dysbiosis. These findings also have implications for development of MECFS specific immune biomarkers and reveal potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Perturbation of effector and regulatory T cell subsets in Myalgic EncephalomyelitisChronic Fatigue Syndrome (MECFS), bioRxiv, 2019-12-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/perturbation_of_effector_and_regulatory_t_cell_subsets_in_myalgic_encephalomyelitischronic_fatigue_syndrome_mecfs_73284635/"},{"date":"2019-12-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Directed cell migration is critical across biological processes spanning healing to cancer invasion, yet no tools allow such migration to be interactively guided.

The resulting scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial pre-indexing of single-cell transcriptomes with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using widely available droplet microfluidics. Pre-indexing allows us to load multiple cells per droplet, which increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq up to 15-fold, and it provides a straightforward way of multiplexing hundreds of samples in a single scifi-RNA-seq experiment.

Cells must tightly control the number and position of kinetochores so that all chromosomes assemble a single kinetochore. A central player in this process is the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENP-A, which localizes specifically within centromeres and promotes kinetochore assembly. However, CENP-A is absent from several eukaryotic lineages including kinetoplastids, a group of evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes that have an unconventional set of kinetochore proteins. It remains unknown how kinetoplastids specify kinetochore positions or promote kinetochore assembly in the absence of CENP-A. Here we studied two homologous kinetoplastid kinases (KKT2 and KKT3) that localize constitutively at centromeres. KKT2 and KKT3 central domains were sufficient for centromere localization in Trypanosoma brucei. Crystal structures of the KKT2 central domain from two divergent kinetoplastids revealed a unique zinc finger domain, which promotes its kinetochore localization in T. brucei.

Here we assess global plankton biogeography and its relation to the biological, chemical and physical context of the ocean (the ‘seascape’) by analyzing 24 terabases of metagenomic sequence data and 739 million metabarcodes from the Tara Oceans expedition in light of environmental data and simulated ocean current transport. In addition to significant local heterogeneity, viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic plankton communities all display near steady-state, large-scale, size-dependent biogeographical patterns. Correlation analyses between plankton transport time and metagenomic or environmental dissimilarity reveal the existence of basin-scale biological and environmental continua emerging within the main current systems. Across oceans, there is a measurable, continuous change within communities and environmental factors up to an average of 1.5 years of travel time. Modulation of plankton communities during transport varies with organismal size, such that the distribution of smaller plankton best matches Longhurst biogeochemical provinces, whereas larger plankton group into larger provinces.

However, it is debated whether this neuronal selectivity can arise spontaneously, or requires training from visual experience. Here, we show that face-selective neurons arise spontaneously in random feedforward networks in the absence of learning. Using biologically inspired deep neural networks, we found that face-selective neurons arise under three different network conditions one trained using non-face natural images, one randomized after being trained, and one never trained. We confirmed that spontaneously emerged face-selective neurons show the biological view-point-invariant characteristics observed in monkeys.

We profiled the naked mole-rat hematopoietic system down to single-cell resolution, and identified several unique features likely contributing to longevity. In adult naked mole-rats red blood cells are formed in spleen and marrow, a neotenic feature beneficial for hypoxic environments and to prevent anemia. Platelet numbers are lower compared to short-lived mice, which may preclude age-related platelet increase and thrombosis. T cells mature in thymus and lymph nodes, providing a supply of T cells after age-related thymus involution. The pool of quiescent stem cells is higher than in mice, and HSCs overexpress an oxidative phosphorylation signature, revealing a new paradigm of stem cell metabolism to benefit longevity and oppose oncogenesis.

To assess the impact of this flexibility on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, the same dataset was independently analyzed by 70 teams, testing nine ex-ante hypotheses.

This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in hypothesis test results, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of their analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Importantly, meta-analytic approaches that aggregated information across teams yielded significant consensus in activated regions across teams. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset. Our findings show that analytic flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and demonstrate factors related to variability in fMRI.

We observe bursts of diversification that generated taxonomic ranks subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, and species. The older burst around 70 Mya resulted in the butterfly subfamilies, with the major evolutionary inventions being unique phenotypic traits shaped by high positive selection and gene duplications. The recent burst around 5 Mya is caused by explosive radiation in diverse butterfly groups associated with diversification in transcription and mRNA regulation, morphogenesis, and mate selection. Rapid radiation correlates with more frequent introgression of speciation-promoting and beneficial genes among radiating species. Radiation and extinction patterns over the last 100 million years suggest the following general model of animal evolution. A population spreads over the land, adapts to various conditions through mutations, and diversifies into several species. Occasional hybridization between these species results in accumulation of beneficial alleles in one, which eventually survives, while others become extinct.

We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, and recover the latent time of the underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the cell’s internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional dynamics. Moreover, scVelo allows us to identify regimes of regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and, therein, systematically detects putative driver genes. We demonstrate that scVelo enables disentangling heterogeneous subpopulation kinetics with unprecedented resolution in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis.

This process affects thousands of transcripts yet precisely how these RNAs are trafficked to their destinations remains generally unclear. Here we have analyzed subcellular transcriptomes of FMRP-null mouse neuronal cells to identify transcripts that depend on FMRP for efficient transport to neurites. We found that these FMRP RNA localization targets contain a large enrichment of G-quadruplex sequences, particularly in their 3′ UTRs, suggesting that FMRP recognizes these sequences to promote the localization of transcripts that contain them. Fractionation of neurons derived from human Fragile X Syndrome patients revealed a high degree of conservation in the identity of FMRP localization targets between human and mouse as well as an enrichment of G-quadruplex sequences in human FMRP RNA localization targets. Using high-throughput RNAprotein interaction assays and single-molecule RNA FISH, we identified the RGG domain of FMRP as important for both interaction with G-quadruplex RNA sequences and the neuronal transport of G-quadruplex-containing transcripts. Finally, we used ribosome footprinting to identify translational regulatory targets of FMRP. The translational regulatory targets were not enriched for G-quadruplex sequences and were largely distinct from the RNA localization targets of FMRP, indicating that the two functions can be biochemically separated and are mediated through different target recognition mechanisms. These results establish a molecular mechanism underlying FMRP-mediated neuronal RNA localization and provide a framework for the elucidation of similar mechanisms governed by other RNA-binding proteins.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"FMRP promotes RNA localization to neuronal projections through interactions between its RGG domain and G-quadruplex RNA sequences, bioRxiv, 2019-09-28","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/fmrp_promotes_rna_localization_to_neuronal_projections_through_interactions_between_its_rgg_domain_and_g-quadruplex_rna_sequences_67386952/"},{"date":"2019-09-28T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBrain maps are essential for integrating information and interpreting the structure-function relationship of circuits and behavior.

To overcome these challenges species tree-aware methods seek to use information from a putative species tree. However, there are few methods available that implement a full likelihood framework or account for horizontal gene transfers. Furthermore, these methods often require expensive data pre-processing (e.g., computing bootstrap trees), and rely on approximations and heuristics that limit the exploration of tree space. Here we present GeneRax, the first maximum likelihood species tree-aware gene tree inference software. It simultaneously accounts for substitutions at the sequence level and gene level events, such as duplication, transfer and loss and uses established maximum likelihood optimization algorithms. GeneRax can infer rooted gene trees for an arbitrary number of gene families, directly from the per-gene sequence alignments and a rooted, but undated, species tree. We show that compared to competing tools, on simulated data GeneRax infers trees that are the closest to the true tree in 90% of the simulations in terms relative Robinson-Foulds distance. While, on empirical datasets, GeneRax is the fastest among all tested methods when starting from aligned sequences, and that it infers trees with the highest likelihood score, based on our model.

However, the degraded nature of aDNA means that aDNA sequencing reads are short, single-ended and frequently mutated by post-mortem chemical modifications. All these features decrease read mapping accuracy and increase reference bias, in which reads containing non-reference alleles are less likely to be mapped than those containing reference alleles. Recently, alternative approaches for read mapping and genetic variation analysis have been developed that replace the linear reference by a variation graph which includes all the alternative variants at each genetic locus. Here, we evaluate the use of variation graph software vg to avoid reference bias for ancient DNA.ResultsWe used vg to align multiple previously published aDNA samples to a variation graph containing 1000 Genome Project variants, and compared these with the same data aligned with bwa to the human linear reference genome. We show that use of vg leads to a much more balanced allelic representation at polymorphic sites and better variant detection in comparison with bwa, especially in the presence of post-mortem changes, effectively removing reference bias. A recently published approach that filters bwa alignments using modified reads also removes bias, but has lower sensitivity than vg.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that aligning aDNA sequences to variation graphs allows recovering a higher fraction of non-reference variation and effectively mitigates the impact of reference bias in population genetics analyses using aDNA, while retaining mapping sensitivity.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Removing reference bias in ancient DNA data analysis by mapping to a sequence variation graph, bioRxiv, 2019-09-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/removing_reference_bias_in_ancient_dna_data_analysis_by_mapping_to_a_sequence_variation_graph_67234416/"},{"date":"2019-09-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe investigated how the two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred at the base of the vertebrate lineage have impacted ancient microsyntenic associations involving developmental regulators (known as genomic regulatory blocks, GRBs).

The latter are subject to presenceabsence variation (PAV), i.e., they may be entirely missing in a given individual and, when present, they are frequently found as a single copy. The enrichment of dispensable genes in survival functions suggests an adaptive value for PAV, which might be the key to explain the extraordinary capabilities of adaptation and invasiveness of this species. Our study underpins a unique metazoan pan-genome architecture only previously described in prokaryotes and in a few non-metazoan eukaryotes, but that might also characterize other marine invertebrates.Significance statementIn animals, intraspecific genomic diversity is generally thought to derive from relatively small-scale variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, small indels, duplications, inversions and translocations. On the other hand, large-scale structural variations which involve the loss of genomic regions encoding protein-coding genes in some individuals (i.e. presenceabsence variation, PAV) have been so far only described in bacteria and, occasionally, in plants and fungi. Here we report the first evidence of a pan-genome in the animal kingdom, revealing that 25% of the genes of the Mediterranean mussel are subject to PAV.

This epigenetic cross-talk establishes an intragenomic conflict silencing the TEs comes with the potential cost of silencing the genes. If the genes are important, however, natural selection will act to maintain function by moderating the silencing response. Such moderation may advantage the TEs. Here, we examined the potential for these epigenetic conflicts by focusing on three TE families in maize - Helitrons, Pack-MULEs and Sirevirus LTR retrotransposons. We documented 1,508 TEs with fragments captured from 2,019 donor genes and characterized the epigenetic profiles of both. Consistent with epigenetic conflict, donor genes mapped more siRNAs and were more methylated than ‘free’ genes that had no evidence of exon capture. However, these patterns differed between syntelog vs. transposed donor genes. Syntelog genes appeared to maintain function, consistent with moderation of the epigenetic response for important genes before reaching a deleterious threshold, while transposed genes bore the signature of silencing and potential pseudogenization. Intriguingly, transposed genes were overrepresented among donor genes, suggesting a link between capture and gene movement. We also investigated the potential for TEs to gain an advantage. TEs with captured fragments were older, mapped fewer siRNAs and had lower levels of methylation than ‘free’ TEs without gene fragments, but they showed no obvious evidence of increased copy numbers. Altogether, our results demonstrate that TE capture triggers an epigenetic conflict when genes are important, contrasting the loss of function for genes that are not under strong selective constraint.

Application to a variety of biological systems revealed a number of unexpected protein-ultrastructure relationships and underscored the value of a comprehensive multimodal view of ultrastructural variability across whole cells.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","500+-users","2019"],"title":"Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells, bioRxiv, 2019-09-20","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/correlative_three-dimensional_super-resolution_and_block_face_electron_microscopy_of_whole_vitreously_frozen_cells_66817456/"},{"date":"2019-09-20T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIn higher plants, germline differentiation occurs during a relatively short period within developing flowers. Understanding of the mechanisms that govern germline differentiation lags behind other plant developmental processes. This is largely because the germline is restricted to relatively few cells buried deep within floral tissues, which makes them difficult to study. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a methodology for live imaging of the germ cell lineage within floral organs of Arabidopsis using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. We have established reporter lines, cultivation conditions, and imaging protocols for high-resolution microscopy of developing flowers continuously for up to several days. We used multiview imagining to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of a flower at subcellular resolution. We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing male and female meiosis, asymmetric pollen division, movement of meiotic chromosomes, and unusual restitution mitosis in tapetum cells.

C. elegans is also used as a model for parasitic nematodes despite being only distantly related to most parasitic species. All ∼65 Caenorhabditis species currently in culture are free-living with most having been isolated from decaying plant or fungal matter. Caenorhabditis bovis is a particularly unusual species, having been isolated several times from the inflamed ears of Zebu cattle in Eastern Africa where it is believed to be the cause of bovine parasitic otitis. C. bovis is therefore of particular interest to researchers interested in the evolution of nematode parasitism and in Caenorhabditis diversity. However, as C. bovis is not in laboratory culture, it remains little studied and details of its prevalence, role in bovine parasitic otitis and relationships to other Caenorhabditis species are scarce. Here, by sampling livestock markets and slaughterhouses in Western Kenya, we successfully reisolate C. bovis from the ear of adult female Zebu. We sequence the genome of C. bovis using the Oxford Nanopore MinION platform in a nearby field laboratory and use the data to generate a chromosome-scale draft genome sequence. We exploit this draft genome to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of C. bovis to other Caenorhabditis species and reveal the changes in genome size and content that have occurred during its evolution. We also identify expansions in several gene families that have been implicated in parasitism in other nematode species, including those associated with resistance to antihelminthic drugs.

Here, we address this problem by engineering cell body-targeted variants of the fluorescent calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We screened fusions of GCaMP6f to both natural as well as engineered peptides, and identified fusions that localized GCaMP6f to within approximately 50 microns of the cell body of neurons in live mice and larval zebrafish. One-photon imaging of soma-targeted GCaMP6f in dense neural circuits reported fewer artifactual spikes from neuropil, increased signal-to-noise ratio, and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons.

In zebrafish, this is thought to depend on the inheritance of maternal mRNAs [1–3], cortical rotation to generate a dorsal pole of beta-catenin activity [4–8] and the release of Nodal signals from the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) [9–12]. Recent work aggregating mouse embryonic stem cells has shown that symmetry breaking can occur in the absence of extra-embryonic tissue [19,20]. To test whether this is also true in zebrafish, we separated embryonic cells from the yolk and allowed them to develop as aggregates. These aggregates break symmetry autonomously to form elongated structures with an anterior-posterior pattern. Extensive cell mixing shows that any pre-existing asymmetry is lost prior to the breaking morphological symmetry, revealing that the maternal pre-pattern is not strictly required for early embryo patterning. Following early signalling events after isolation of embryonic cells reveals that a pole of Nodal activity precedes and is required for elongation. The blocking of PCP-dependent convergence and extension movements disrupts the establishment of opposing poles of BMP and WntTCF activity and the patterning of anterior-posterior neural tissue. These results lead us to suggest that convergence and extension plays a causal role in the establishment of morphogen gradients and pattern formation during zebrafish gastrulation.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Self-organised symmetry breaking in zebrafish reveals feedback from morphogenesis to pattern formation, bioRxiv, 2019-09-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/self-organised_symmetry_breaking_in_zebrafish_reveals_feedback_from_morphogenesis_to_pattern_formation_66593193/"},{"date":"2019-09-14T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryAlthough female pluripotency significantly differs to male, complications with in vitro culture of female embryonic stem cells (ESC) have severely limited the use and study of these cells.

Determining which combination of alleles an individual possesses for each HLA gene (high-resolution HLA-typing) is essential to establish donor-recipient compatibility in organ and bone-marrow transplantations.

These boundaries during dynamic experience also led to the segmentation of adjacent episodes in later memory, evidenced by changes in memory for the timing, order, and perceptual details of recent event sequences. Critically, we find that distinct cognitive components of this pupil response were associated with both subjective (temporal distance judgements) and objective (temporal order discrimination) measures of episodic memory, suggesting that multiple arousal-mediated cognitive processes help construct meaningful mnemonic events.

We first characterized hormone levels and whole brain gene expression across parental care stages during sex-typical care.

Furthermore, counterintuitively, over-parameterized models, similarly to evolutionary processes, can be simple and parsimonious as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. In contrast to traditional scientific models, where the ultimate goal is interpretability, over-parameterized models eschew interpretability in favor of solving real-life problems or tasks. We contend that over-parameterized blind fitting presents a radical challenge to many of the underlying assumptions and practices in computational neuroscience and cognitive psychology. At the same time, this shift in perspective informs longstanding debates and establishes unexpected links with evolution, ecological psychology, and artificial life.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Direct-fit to nature an evolutionary perspective on biological (and artificial) neural networks, bioRxiv, 2019-09-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/direct-fit_to_nature_an_evolutionary_perspective_on_biological_and_artificial_neural_networks_66394854/"},{"date":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","description":"The allocation of a sequencing budget when designing single cell RNA-seq experiments requires consideration of the tradeoff between number of cells sequenced and the read depth per cell. One approach to the problem is to perform a power analysis for a univariate objective such as differential expression. However, many of the goals of single-cell analysis requires consideration of the multivariate structure of gene expression, such as clustering. We introduce an approach to quantifying the impact of sequencing depth and cell number on the estimation of a multivariate generative model for gene expression that is based on error analysis in the framework of a variational autoencoder. We find that at shallow depths, the marginal benefit of deeper sequencing per cell significantly outweighs the benefit of increased cell numbers.

However, obtaining the absolute abundance of many bacterial species is typically prohibitively expensive. In contrast, relative abundance data for many species is comparatively cheap and easy to collect (e.g., with universal primers for the 16S rRNA gene). In this paper, we propose a method to jointly model relative abundance data for many taxa and absolute abundance data for a subset of taxa. Our method provides point and interval estimates for the absolute abundance of all taxa. Crucially, our proposal accounts for differences in the efficiency of taxon detection in the relative and absolute abundance data. We show that modeling taxon-specific efficiencies substantially reduces the estimation error for absolute abundance, and controls the coverage of interval estimators. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method via a simulation study, a sensitivity study where we jackknife the taxa with observed absolute abundances, and a study of women with bacterial vaginosis.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"A multi-view model for relative and absolute microbial abundances, bioRxiv, 2019-09-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_multi-view_model_for_relative_and_absolute_microbial_abundances_66231516/"},{"date":"2019-09-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractUnderstanding how higher order cognitive function emerges from the underlying brain structure depends on quantifying how the behaviour of discrete regions are integrated within the broader cortical landscape. Recent work has established that this macroscale brain organization and function can be quantified in a compact manner through the use of multivariate machine learning approaches that identify manifolds often described as cortical gradients. By quantifying topographic principles of macroscale organization, cortical gradients lend an analytical framework to study structural and functional brain organization across species, throughout development and aging, and its perturbations in disease. More generally, its macroscale perspective on brain organization offers novel possibilities to investigate the complex relationships between brain structure, function, and cognition in a quantified manner. Here, we present a compact workflow and open-access toolbox that allows for (i) the identification of gradients (from structural or functional imaging data), (ii) their alignment (across subjects or modalities), and (iii) their visualization (in embedding or cortical space). Our toolbox also allows for controlled association studies between gradients with other brain-level features, adjusted with respect to several null models that account for spatial autocorrelation. The toolbox is implemented in both Python and Matlab, programming languages widely used by the neuroimaging and network neuroscience communities.

We systematically profiled the performance of deep models, kernel models, and linear models as a function of sample size on UK Biobank brain images against established machine learning references. On MNIST and Zalando Fashion, prediction accuracy consistently improved when escalating from linear models to shallow-nonlinear models, and further improved when switching to deep-nonlinear models. The more observations were available for model training, the greater the performance gain we saw. In contrast, using structural or functional brain scans, simple linear models performed on par with more complex, highly parameterized models in agesex prediction across increasing sample sizes. In fact, linear models kept improving as the sample size approached ∼10,000 participants.

Here, we directly compare the transcriptomes of homologous growth cartilages of the mouse (Mus musculus) and bipedal jerboa (Jaculus jaculus), which has extremely long metatarsals of the feet and ‘mouse-like’ arms. When we intersected gene expression differences in metatarsals of the two species with expression differences in forearms, we found that about 10% of all orthologous genes are associated with disproportionate elongation of jerboa feet. Among these, Shox2, has gained expression in jerboa metatarsals where it is not expressed in other vertebrates that have been assessed. This transcription factor is necessary for proximal limb elongation, and we show that it is sufficient to increase mouse distal limb length. Unexpectedly, we also found evidence that jerboa foot elongation occurs in part by releasing latent growth potential that is repressed in mouse feet. In jerboa metatarsals, we observed higher expression of Crabp1, an antagonist of growth inhibitory retinoic acid, lower expression of Gdf10, an inhibitory TGFβ ligand, and lower expression of Mab21L2, a BMP signaling inhibitor that we show is sufficient to reduce limb bone elongation.

In these threatened landscapes, there are many organisms that acquire chemical defenses from their diet and are therefore intimately connected with their local food webs. Poison frogs (Family Dendrobatidae) are one such example, as they acquire alkaloid-based chemical defenses from their diet of leaf litter ants and mites. It is currently unknown how habitat fragmentation impacts chemical defense across trophic levels, from arthropods to frogs. Thus, we examined the chemical defenses and diets of the Diablito poison frog (Oophaga sylvatica), and the diversity of their leaf litter ant communities in secondary forest and reclaimed cattle pasture. We found that forest and pasture frogs differed in diet and alkaloid profiles, where forest frogs contained more of specific alkaloids and ate more ants. We also found that the leaf litter of forest and pasture frog habitats differed in ant community structure. Finally, ant species composition of frog diets resembled the surrounding leaf litter, but diets were less variable. This suggests that frogs tend to consume particular ant species within each habitat. To better understand how ants contribute to the alkaloid chemical profiles of frogs, we chemically profiled several ant species and found some alkaloids to be common across many ant species while others are restricted to a few species. Our experiments are the first to link anthropogenic land use changes to dendrobatid poison frog chemical defenses through variation in leaf litter communities, which has implications for conservation management of these threatened amphibians.ResumenLos bosques tropicales, que mantienen la mayor parte de la biodiversidad del planeta, están cada vez más fragmentados por diferentes prácticas agrícolas. En estos paisajes amenazados por la actividad humana hay organismos que acumulan defensas químicas a partir de su dieta. Las ranas venenosas (Familia Dendrobatidae) son un ejemplo de esto, y adquieren de su dieta, formada principalmente de hormigas de la hojarasca y de ácaros, diferentes alcaloides que pueden ser usados como defensas químicas. Las ranas venenosas están por lo tanto íntimamente conectadas a las redes tróficas locales. Actualmente es desconocido como la fragmentación del hábitat modifica la defensa por químicos a través de cambios en las cadena tróficas. Por lo tanto, examinamos las defensas químicas y dietas de la rana diablito (Oophaga sylvatica), y las comunidades de hormigas de la hojarasca, en un bosque secundario y en un pastizal cercano. Encontramos que las dietas y los perfiles de alcaloides en la piel de las ranas en bosque y en pastizal eran diferentes, con las ranas de bosque comiendo más hormigas y acumulando más alcaloides específicos. También encontramos que la hojarasca del bosque y del pastizal mantenían comunidades de hormigas con estructuras distintas. Finalmente, la composición de las hormigas en las dietas se parecían que la composición de hormigas en sus alrededores, pero dietas menos variables. Ello sugiere que las ranas tienden a consumir sólo ciertas especies de hormigas en cada hábitat. Para entender mejor cómo las hormigas contribuyen a los perfiles de alcaloides de las ranas, obtuvimos perfiles de los alcaloides presentes en algunas especies de hormigas y encontramos que algunos alcaloides son comunes a muchas especies de hormigas, y otros alcaloides están restringidos a pocas especies. Nuestros experimentos son los primeros en vincular los cambios antropogénicos en el uso de suelo con cambios en las defensas químicas de las ranas venenosas a través de cambios en las comunidades de la hojarasca, lo que tiene implicaciones para la conservación de estos anfibios altamente amenazados.","tags":["biorxiv","ecology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Land use impacts poison frog chemical defenses through changes in leaf litter ant communities, bioRxiv, 2019-08-31","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/land_use_impacts_poison_frog_chemical_defenses_through_changes_in_leaf_litter_ant_communities_65690558/"},{"date":"2019-08-30T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryAstrocytic Ca2+ signaling has been intensively studied in health and disease but remains uncharacterized in sleep.

Senescent cells accumulate during ageing and are associated with diseases, such as cancer, fibrosis and many age-related pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that the selective elimination of senescent cells can be effective on the treatment of many of these senescence-associated diseases. A universal characteristic of senescent cells is that they display elevated activity of the lysosomal β-galactosidase this has been exploited as a marker for senescence (senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity). Consequently, we hypothesised that galactose-modified cytotoxic prodrugs will be preferentially processed by senescent cells, resulting in their selective killing. Here, we show that different galactose-modified duocarmycin (GMD) derivatives preferentially kill senescent cells. GMD prodrugs induce selective apoptosis of senescent cells in a lysosomal β-galactosidase (GLB1)-dependent manner. GMD prodrugs can eliminate a broad range of senescent cells in culture, and treatment with a GMD prodrug enhances the elimination of bystander senescent cells that accumulate upon whole body irradiation or doxorubicin treatment of mice. Moreover, taking advantage of a mouse model of human adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP), we show that treatment with a GMD pro-drug result selectively reduced the number of β-catenin-positive preneoplastic senescent cells, what could have therapeutic implications. In summary, the above results show that galactose-modified duocarmycin prodrugs behave as senolytics, suggesting that they could be used to treat a wide range of senescence-related pathologies.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Galactose-modified duocarmycin prodrugs as senolytics, bioRxiv, 2019-08-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/galactose-modified_duocarmycin_prodrugs_as_senolytics_65413535/"},{"date":"2019-08-23T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe report chromosome-level, reference-quality assemblies of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions selected across the global range of this predominately ruderal plant.

Like all other imaging modalities, the resolution, speed, sample preservation, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of point scanning systems are difficult to optimize simultaneously. In particular, point scanning systems are uniquely constrained by an inverse relationship between imaging speed and pixel resolution. Here we show these limitations can be mitigated via the use of deep learning-based super-sampling of undersampled images acquired on a point-scanning system, which we termed point-scanning super-resolution (PSSR) imaging. Oversampled, high SNR ground truth images acquired on scanning electron or Airyscan laser scanning confocal microscopes were crappified to generate semi-synthetic training data for PSSR models that were then used to restore real-world undersampled images. Remarkably, our EM PSSR model could restore undersampled images acquired with different optics, detectors, samples, or sample preparation methods in other labs. PSSR enabled previously unattainable 2 nm resolution images with our serial block face scanning electron microscope system. For fluorescence, we show that undersampled confocal images combined with a multiframe PSSR model trained on Airyscan timelapses facilitates Airyscan-equivalent spatial resolution and SNR with ~100x lower laser dose and 16x higher frame rates than corresponding high-resolution acquisitions. In conclusion, PSSR facilitates point-scanning image acquisition with otherwise unattainable resolution, speed, and sensitivity.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Deep Learning-Based Point-Scanning Super-Resolution Imaging, bioRxiv, 2019-08-22","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/deep_learning-based_point-scanning_super-resolution_imaging_65273568/"},{"date":"2019-08-22T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenes are regulated through enhancer sequences, in which transcription factor binding motifs and their specific arrangements (syntax) form a cis-regulatory code.

However, in spatially structured populations, the spread of beneficial mutations with spatially uniform effects can also induce transient genetic differentiation and numerous theoretical studies have suggested that species-wide, or global, adaptation makes a substantial contribution to molecular evolution. In this study, we ask whether such global adaptation affects the genome-wide distribution of FST and generates statistical outliers which could be mistaken for local adaptation. Using forward-in-time population genetic simulations assuming parameters for the rate and strength of beneficial mutations similar to those that have been estimated for natural populations, we show the spread of globally beneficial in parapatric populations can readily generate FST outliers, which may be misinterpreted as evidence for local adaptation. The spread of beneficial mutations causes selective sweeps at flanking sites, so the effects of global versus local adaptation may be distinguished by examining patterns of nucleotide diversity along with FST.

The syntR algorithm performs as well as previous ad-hoc methods while being systematic, repeatable, and is applicable to mapping chromosomal rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax.Using syntR, and we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years – a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This non-random exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our understanding of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus has an exceptional rate of chromosomal rearrangement that may facilitate similarly rapid diversification.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Ancestral reconstruction of sunflower karyotypes reveals non-random chromosomal evolution, bioRxiv, 2019-08-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/ancestral_reconstruction_of_sunflower_karyotypes_reveals_non-random_chromosomal_evolution_65028683/"},{"date":"2019-08-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe protozoanPlasmodium vivaxis responsible for 42% of all cases of malaria outside Africa.

The lack of genomic information on the extinct European lineage has prevented a clear understanding of historical population structuring and past migrations ofP. vivax. We used medical microscope slides prepared in 1944 from malaria-affected patients from the Ebro Delta in Spain, one of the last footholds of malaria in Europe, to generate a genome of a EuropeanP. vivaxstrain. Population genetics and phylogenetic analyses placed this strain basal to a cluster including samples from the Americas. This genome allowed us to calibrate a genomic mutation rate forP. vivax, and to estimate the mean age of the last common ancestor between European and American strains to the 15th century. This date points to an introduction of the parasite during the European colonisation of the Americas. In addition, we found that some known variants for resistance to anti-malarial drugs, including Chloroquine and Sulfadoxine, were already present in this European strain, predating their use.

Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters which have been proposed to modulate host nervous system activity and behaviors2. However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain modulation and its physiological relevance is largely unknown. Here we show that in C. elegans, the neuromodulator tyramine (TA) produced by gut-colonizing commensal Providencia bacteria can bypass the requirement for host TA biosynthesis to manipulate a host sensory decision. Bacterially-produced TA is likely converted to octopamine (OA) by the host tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme. OA, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 receptor on the ASHASI sensory neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify genes required for TA biosynthesis in Providencia, and show that these genes are necessary for modulation of host behavior. We further find that C. elegans colonized by Providencia preferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially-produced TA. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut microbiota mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, thereby promoting fitness of both host and microbe.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Modulation of sensory behavior and food choice by an enteric bacteria-produced neurotransmitter, bioRxiv, 2019-08-15","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/modulation_of_sensory_behavior_and_food_choice_by_an_enteric_bacteria-produced_neurotransmitter_65002334/"},{"date":"2019-08-15T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTRecent transcriptional profiling technologies are uncovering previously-undefined cell populations and molecular markers at an unprecedented pace.

Recent evidence suggests that lipids synthesized by a host are transferred to AM fungi that possess no fatty acid synthase genes in their genome and that mutations in lipid biosynthesis-related genes of the host lead the symbiotic interaction to fail (1–3). We hypothesized that lipids derived from plants are crucial for AM fungal growth and reproduction. In this study, we evaluated whether AM fungi can grow on medium supplied with fatty acids under asymbiotic conditions without the host. Myristate led to an extensive hyphal growth of Rhizophagus irregularis and an increase in biomass production. Other examined fatty acids showed no effect on biomass production. Myristate also induced secondary spore formation. The myristate-induced spores can germinate, colonize carrot hairy roots, and form the next generation of mature daughter spores. A fluorescently labeled fatty acid probe was taken up by branched hyphae of AM fungi. Tracer experiments using 13C-labeled myristic acid showed that myristate and its metabolites were utilized for the synthesis of triacylglycerol and cell wall components of AM fungi.

Such lineages include Asgard archaea1–3, which are purported to represent archaea with eukaryotic cell complexity, and the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), a novel domain level taxon erected solely on the basis of metagenomic data4. However, it has escaped the attention of most biologists that these metagenomic sequences are not assembled into genomes by sequence overlap, as for cultured archaea and bacteria. Instead, short contigs are sorted into computer files by a process called binning in which they receive taxonomic assignment on the basis of sequence properties like GC content, dinucleotide frequencies, and stoichiometric co-occurrence across samples. Consequently, they are not genome sequences as we know them, reflecting the gene content of real organisms. Rather they are metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Debates that Asgard data are contaminated with individual eukaryotic sequences5–7 are overshadowed by the more pressing issue that no evidence exists to indicate that any sequences in binned Asgard MAGs actually stem from the same chromosome, as opposed to simply stemming from the same environment. Here we show that Asgard and CPR MAGs fail spectacularly to meet the most basic phylogenetic criterion8 fulfilled by genome sequences of all cultured prokaryotes investigated to date the ribosomal proteins of Asgard and CPR MAGs do not share common evolutionary histories. Their phylogenetic behavior is anomalous to a degree never observed with genomes of real organisms.

For some malignancies, particularly chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) and testicular cancer, there are a larger proportion of variants with larger effect sizes than those for other cancers. In contrast, most variants for lung and breast cancers have very small associated effect sizes. For different cancer sites, we estimate a wide range of GWAS sample sizes, required to explain 80% of GWAS heritability, varying from 60,000 cases for CLL to over 1,000,000 cases for lung cancer.

These regulatory regions are enriched for active enhancer marks and transcription factor binding sites, but largely devoid of CTCF binding sites. Stabilization of cohesin, which leads to a loss of dynamic cohesin from these regions, does not affect transcription factor binding or active enhancer marks, but does result in changes in promoter-enhancer interactions and downregulation of genes. Acute cohesin depletion can phenocopy the effect of WAPL depletion, showing that cohesin plays a crucial role in maintaining expression of lineage specific genes. The binding of dynamic cohesin to chromatin is dependent on the pluripotency transcription factor OCT4, but not NANOG. Finally, dynamic cohesin binding sites are also found in differentiated cells, suggesting that they represent a general regulatory principle.

We found that an unexpectedly large number of non-oncology drugs selectively inhibited subsets of cancer cell lines. Moreover, the killing activity of the majority of these drugs was predictable based on the molecular features of the cell lines. Follow-up of several of these compounds revealed novel mechanisms.

We further found that the redness of growing feathers was positively related to the performance of liver mitochondria.

Analysis of serological responses against pathogens with multiple strains such as influenza pose a specific statistical challenge because observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend both on unobserved prior infections and the resulting cross-reactive antibody dynamics that these infections generate. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer these two typically confounded biological processes using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody dynamics that generates expected antibody titres over time. This makes it possible to use observations of antibodies in serological assays to infer an individual’s infection history as well as the parameters of the antibody process model. Our aim is to provide a flexible inference package that can be applied to a range of datasets studying different viruses over different timescales. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, and well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Serosolver an open source tool to infer epidemiological and immunological dynamics from serological data, bioRxiv, 2019-08-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/serosolver_an_open_source_tool_to_infer_epidemiological_and_immunological_dynamics_from_serological_data_64738862/"},{"date":"2019-08-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractA key feature that differentiates prokaryotes from eukaryotes is the absence of an intracellular membrane surrounding the chromosomal DNA.

RNA sequencing analysis of LAM revealed a transcriptional profile driven by innate inflammation distinct from previously reported microglial states. An unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 screen identified genetic modifiers of lipid droplet formation; surprisingly, variants of several of these genes, including progranulin, are causes of autosomal dominant forms of human neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we report that commonly consumed non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac), a lipid-lowering drug (gemfibrozil), and a β-blocker (propanolol), at clinically and environmentally relevant concentrations, significantly accelerated the conjugation of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance genes. We looked at the response to these drugs by the bacteria involved in the gene transfer through various analyses that included monitoring reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell membrane permeability by flow cytometry, cell arrangement, and whole-genome RNA and protein sequencing. We found the enhanced conjugation correlated well with increased production of ROS and cell membrane permeability. We also detected closer cell-to-cell contact and upregulated conjugal genes. Additionally, these non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals caused the bacteria to have responses similar to those detected when exposed to antibiotics, such as inducing the SOS response, and enhancing efflux pumps.

However, a number of genes display highly unstable promoter Pol II, suggesting that paused polymerase might dissociate from template DNA at these promoters and release a short, non-productive mRNA. Here, we report that paused Pol II can be actively destabilized by the Integrator complex. Specifically, Integrator utilizes its RNA endonuclease activity to cleave nascent RNA and drive termination of paused Pol II.

These benefits extend to the developing embryo, where NMN supplementation in embryo culture media following IVF enhances blastocyst formation in older mice.

Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies evaluating the suitability of the available assembly tools for this new type of data.FindingsWe benchmarked the ability of different short-reads and long-reads tools to assembly two different commercially available mock communities, and observed remarkable differences in the resulting assemblies depending on the software of choice. Short-reads metagenomic assemblers proved unsuitable for MinION data. Among the long-reads assemblers tested, Flye and Canu were the only ones performing well in all the datasets. These tools were able to retrieve complete individual genomes directly from the metagenome, and assembled a bacterial genome in only two contigs in the best scenario.

However, errors still had an impact on the prediction of biosynthetic gene clusters.ConclusionsMinION metagenomic sequencing data proved sufficient for assembling low-complex microbial communities, leading to the recovery of highly complete and contiguous individual genomes.

However, many of these studies are done in predominantly European populations (Bustamante et al., 2011; Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016). Although GWAS effect sizes correlate across ancestries (Wojcik et al., 2019), risk scores show substantial reductions in accuracy when applied to non-European populations (Kim et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2019; Scutari et al., 2016). We use simulations to show that human demographic history and negative selection on complex traits result in population specific genetic architectures. For traits under moderate negative selection, ~50% of the heritability can be accounted for by variants in Europe that are absent from Africa. We show that this directly leads to poor performance in risk prediction when using variants discovered in Europe to predict risk in African populations, especially in the tails of the risk distribution. To evaluate the impact of this effect in genomic data, we built a Bayesian model to stratify heritability between European-specific and shared variants and applied it to 43 traits and diseases in the UK Biobank. Across these phenotypes, we find ~50% of the heritability comes from European-specific variants, setting an upper bound on the accuracy of genetic risk prediction in non-European populations using effect sizes discovered in European populations.

Here we mathematically clarify the precise information that can be extracted from extant timetrees under the generalized birth-death model, which underlies the majority of existing estimation methods. We prove that for a given extant timetree and a candidate diversification scenario, there exists an infinite number of alternative diversification scenarios that are equally likely to have generated a given tree. These “congruent” scenarios cannot possibly be distinguished using extant timetrees alone, even in the presence of infinite data. Importantly, congruent diversification scenarios can exhibit markedly different and yet plausible diversification dynamics, suggesting that many previous studies may have over-interpreted phylogenetic evidence.

More generally, such methods can compare expression levels in multiple sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. However, given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis. For example, one could investigate the condition-specific responses of cell subpopulations measured from patients from each condition; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. In this work, we surveyed the methods available to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated “pseudobulk” data.

Conserved interneuron types varied significantly in abundance and RNA expression between mice and primates, but varied much more modestly among primates. In adult primates, the expression patterns of dozens of genes exhibited spatial expression gradients among neocortical interneurons, suggesting that adult neocortical interneurons are imprinted by their local cortical context.

In this study, we analyzed SNP-chip genetic data from 2 184 individuals born in France who were enrolled in two independent population cohorts. Using FineStructure, six different genetic clusters of individuals were found that were very consistent between the two cohorts. These clusters match extremely well the geography and overlap with historical and linguistic divisions of France. By modeling the relationship between genetics and geography using EEMS software, we were able to detect gene flow barriers that are similar in the two cohorts and corresponds to major French rivers or mountains. Estimations of effective population sizes using IBDNe program also revealed very similar patterns in both cohorts with a rapid increase of effective population sizes over the last 150 generations similar to what was observed in other European countries. A marked bottleneck is also consistently seen in the two datasets starting in the fourteenth century when the Black Death raged in Europe.

Immunodepletion of FACT subunits from extract potently inhibits Cas9 unloading and converts Cas9’s activity from multi-turnover to single-turnover. In human cells, depletion of FACT delays genome editing and alters the balance between indel formation and homology directed repair.

The authors argue that the mechanism of these copy number gains was somatic integration of APP mRNA into the genome, creating what they called genomic cDNA (gencDNA). We reanalyzed the data from the Lee study, revealing evidence that APP gencDNA originates mainly from contamination by exogenous APP recombinant vectors, rather from true somatic retrotransposition of endogenous APP. Our reanalysis of two recent whole exome sequencing (WES) datasets—one by the authors of the Lee study3 and the other by Park et al.4—revealed that reads claimed to support APP gencDNA in AD samples resulted from contamination by PCR products and mRNA, respectively.

In aposematic species, color and pattern is directly tied to survival and thus understanding the origin of the phenotype has been a focus of both theoretical and empirical inquiry. In order to better understand this diversity, we examined gene expression in skin tissue during development in four different color morphs of the aposematic mimic poison frog, Ranitomeya imitator. We identified a suite of candidate color-related genes a priori and identified the pattern of expression in these genes over time, differences in expression of these genes between the mimetic morphs, and genetic variants that differ between color morphs. We identified several candidate color genes that are differentially expressed over time or across populations, as well as a number of color genes with fixed genetic variants between color morphs. Many of the color genes we discovered in our dataset are involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including several fixed SNPs between color morphs. Further, many genes in this pathway were differentially expressed at different points in development (e.g., lef1, tyr, tyrp1). Importantly, Wnt signaling pathway genes are overrepresented relative to expression in Xenopus tropicalis. Taken together, this provides evidence that the Wnt signaling pathway is contributing to color pattern production in R. imitator, and is an excellent candidate for producing some of the differences in color pattern between morphs. In addition, we found evidence that sepiapterin reductase is likely important in the production of yellow-green coloration in this adaptive radiation. Finally, two iridophore genes (arfap1, gart) draw a strong parallel to previous work in another dendrobatid, indicating that these genes are also strong candidates for differential color production. We have used high throughput sequencing throughout development to examine the evolution of coloration in a rapid mimetic adaptive radiation and found that these divergent color patterns are likely to be affected by a combination of developmental patterns of gene expression, color morph-specific gene expression, and color morph-specific gene variants.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Differential gene expression and gene variants drive color and pattern development in divergent color morphs of a mimetic poison frog, bioRxiv, 2019-07-22","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/differential_gene_expression_and_gene_variants_drive_color_and_pattern_development_in_divergent_color_morphs_of_a_mimetic_poison_frog_63857422/"},{"date":"2019-07-21T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractUsing an online survey of academics at 55 randomly selected institutions across the US and Canada, we explore priorities for publishing decisions and their perceived importance within review, promotion, and tenure (RPT).

However, associations between polygenic scores and education capture not only genetic propensity but information about the environment that individuals are exposed to. This is because individuals passively inherit effects of parental genotypes, since their parents typically also provide the rearing environment. In other words, the strong correlation between offspring and parent genotypes results in an association between the offspring genotypes and the rearing environment. This is termed passive gene-environment correlation. We present an approach to test for the extent of passive gene-environment correlation for education without requiring intergenerational data. Specifically, we use information from 6311 individuals in the UK Biobank who were adopted in childhood to compare genetic influence on education between adoptees and non-adopted individuals. Adoptees’ rearing environments are less correlated with their genotypes, because they do not share genes with their adoptive parents. We find that polygenic scores are twice as predictive of years of education in non-adopted individuals compared to adoptees (R2= 0.074 vs 0.037, difference test p= 8.23 × 10−24). We provide another kind of evidence for the influence of parental behaviour on offspring education individuals in the lowest decile of education polygenic score attain significantly more education if they are adopted, possibly due to educationally supportive adoptive environments. Overall, these results suggest that genetic influences on education are mediated via the home environment.

H3K4me3 has been ascribed roles as both an instructor of gene expression and also a downstream consequence of expression, yet neither has been convincingly proven on a genome-wide scale. Here we test these relationships using a combination of bioinformatics, modelling and experimental data from budding yeast in which the levels of H3K4me3 have been massively ablated. We find that loss of H3K4me3 has no effect on the levels of nascent transcription or transcript in the population. Moreover, we observe no change in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, mRNA export or turnover, or in protein levels, or cell-to-cell variation of mRNA. Loss of H3K4me3 also has no effect on the large changes in gene expression patterns that follow galactose induction. Conversely, loss of RNA polymerase from the nucleus has no effect on the pattern of H3K4me3 deposition and little effect on its levels, despite much larger changes to other chromatin features. Furthermore, large genome-wide changes in transcription, both in response to environmental stress and during metabolic cycling, are not accompanied by corresponding changes in H3K4me3. Thus, despite the correlation between H3K4me3 and gene activity, neither appear to be necessary to maintain levels of the other, nor to influence their changes in response to environmental stimuli. When we compare gene classes with very different levels of H3K4me3 but highly similar transcription levels we find that H3K4me3-marked genes are those whose expression is unresponsive to environmental changes, and that their histones are less acetylated and dynamically turned-over.

Dysregulation in cortisol, a stress hormone that is the primary output of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, has been hypothesized to be a mechanism for how early environmental adversity compromises health. However, despite the popularity of cortisol as a biomarker for stress and adversity, little is known about whether cortisol output differs in children being raised in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. Here, we show that there are few differences between advantaged and disadvantaged children in their cortisol output. In 8- to 14-year-old children from the population-based Texas Twin Project, we measured cortisol output at three different time-scales (1) diurnal fluctuation in salivary cortisol (n = 400), (2) salivary cortisol reactivity and recovery after exposure to the Trier Social Stress Test (n = 444), and (3) and cortisol concentration in hair (n = 1,210). These measures converged on two moderately correlated, yet distinguishable, dimensions of HPA function. We then tested differences in cortisol output across nine aspects of social disadvantage at the home (e.g., family socioeconomic status), school (e.g., average levels of academic achievement), and neighborhood (e.g., concentrated poverty). Children living in neighborhoods with higher concentrated poverty had higher diurnal cortisol output, as measured in saliva; otherwise, child cortisol output was unrelated to any other aspect of social disadvantage. Overall, we find limited support for alteration in HPA axis functioning as a general mechanism for the health consequences of socioeconomic inequality in childhood.","tags":["biorxiv","physiology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Weak and uneven associations of home, neighborhood and school environments with stress hormone output across multiple time scales, bioRxiv, 2019-07-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/weak_and_uneven_associations_of_home_neighborhood_and_school_environments_with_stress_hormone_output_across_multiple_time_scales_63707465/"},{"date":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBrain-machine interfaces (BMIs) hold promise for the restoration of sensory and motor function and the treatment of neurological disorders, but clinical BMIs have not yet been widely adopted, in part because modest channel counts have limited their potential.

While there have been significant advances in understanding how DNA sequence and shape contribute to recognition, some fundamental aspects of protein-DNA binding remain poorly understood2,3. Many DNA-binding proteins induce changes in the DNA structure outside the intrinsic B-DNA envelope. How the energetic cost associated with distorting DNA contributes to recognition has proven difficult to study and measure experimentally because the distorted DNA structures exist as low-abundance conformations in the naked B-DNA ensemble4–10. Here, we use a novel high-throughput assay called SaMBA (Saturation Mismatch-Binding Assay) to investigate the role of DNA conformational penalties in TF-DNA recognition. The approach introduces mismatched base-pairs (i.e. mispairs) within TF binding sites to pre-induce a variety of DNA structural distortions much larger than those induced by changes in Watson-Crick sequence. Strikingly, while most mismatches either weakened TF binding (~70%) or had negligible effects (~20%), approximately 10% of mismatches increased binding and at least one mismatch was found that increased the binding affinity for each of 21 examined TFs. Mismatches also converted sites from the non-specific affinity range into specific sites, and high-affinity sites into “super-sites” stronger than any known canonical binding site. These findings reveal a complex binding landscape that cannot be explained based on DNA sequence alone. Analysis of crystal structures together with NMR and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that many of the mismatches that increase binding induce distortions similar to those induced by TF binding, thus pre-paying some of the energetic cost to deform the DNA. Our work indicates that conformational penalties are a major determinant of protein-DNA recognition, and reveals mechanisms by which mismatches can recruit TFs and thus modulate replication and repair activities in the cell11,12.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"DNA mismatches reveal widespread conformational penalties in protein-DNA recognition, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/dna_mismatches_reveal_widespread_conformational_penalties_in_protein-dna_recognition_63670576/"},{"date":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYNon-genetic transcriptional variability at the single-cell level is a potential mechanism for therapy resistance in melanoma. Specifically, rare subpopulations of melanoma cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes. Importantly, these rare cells are able to survive drug treatment and develop resistance. How might these extremely rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical stochastic models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentified molecular mechanisms. Here we use mathematical modeling to show that a minimal network comprising of transcriptional bursting and interactions between genes can give rise to rare coordinated high states. We next show that although these states occur across networks of different sizes, they depend strongly on three (out of seven) model parameters and require network connectivity to be ≤ 6. Interestingly, we find that while entry into the rare coordinated high state is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit from it occurs through the independent inactivation of individual genes. Finally, our model predicts that increased network connectivity can lead to transcriptionally stable states, which we verify using network inference analysis of experimental data. In sum, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufficient to describe this new class of rare cell variability and argue for its general existence in other biological contexts.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Gene networks with transcriptional bursting recapitulate rare transient coordinated expression states in cancer, bioRxiv, 2019-07-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/gene_networks_with_transcriptional_bursting_recapitulate_rare_transient_coordinated_expression_states_in_cancer_63645752/"},{"date":"2019-07-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDe novo genome assembly provides comprehensive, unbiased genomic information and makes it possible to gain insight into new DNA sequences not present in reference genomes. Many de novo human genomes have been published in the last few years, leveraging a combination of inexpensive short-read and single-molecule long-read technologies. As long-read DNA sequencers become more prevalent, the computational burden of generating assemblies persists as a critical factor. The most common approach to long-read assembly, using an overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm, requires all-to-all read comparisons, which quadratically scales in computational complexity with the number of reads. We assert that recently achievements in sequencing technology (i.e. with accuracy ~99% and read length ~10-15k) enables a fundamentally better strategy for OLC that is effectively linear rather than quadratic. Our genome assembly implementation, Peregrine uses sparse hierarchical minimizers (SHIMMER) to index reads thereby avoiding the need for an all-to-all read comparison step. Peregrine can assemble 30x human PacBio CCS read datasets in less than 30 CPU hours and around 100 wall-clock minutes to a high contiguity assembly (N50 \u0026gt; 20Mb).

We discovered an injury-specific progenitor cell state characterized by Krt8 in flat epithelial cells covering alveolar surfaces. The number of these cells peaked during fibrogenesis in independent mouse models, as well as in human acute lung injury and fibrosis. Krt8+ progenitors featured a highly distinct connectome of receptor-ligand pairs with endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. To ‘sky dive’ into epithelial differentiation dynamics, we sequenced \u0026gt;30,000 sorted epithelial cells at 18 timepoints and computationally derived cell state trajectories that were validated by lineage tracing genetic reporter mice. Airway stem cells within the club cell lineage and alveolar type-2 cells underwent transcriptional convergence onto the same Krt8+ progenitor cell state, which later resolved by terminal differentiation into alveolar type-1 cells. We derived distinct transcriptional regulators as key switch points in this process and show that induction of TNF-alphaNFkappaB, p53, and hypoxia driven gene expression programs precede a Sox4, Ctnnb1, and Wwtr1 driven switch towards alveolar type-1 cell fate.

During this time (c. 750 to 1050 CE), the Vikings reached most of western Eurasia, Greenland, and North America, and left a cultural legacy that persists till today. To understand the genetic structure and influence of the Viking expansion, we sequenced the genomes of 442 ancient humans from across Europe and Greenland ranging from the Bronze Age (c. 2400 BC) to the early Modern period (c. 1600 CE), with particular emphasis on the Viking Age. We find that the period preceding the Viking Age was accompanied by foreign gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east spreading from Denmark and eastern Sweden to the rest of Scandinavia. Despite the close linguistic similarities of modern Scandinavian languages, we observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, suggesting that regional population differences were already present 1,000 years ago. We find evidence for a majority of Danish Viking presence in England, Swedish Viking presence in the Baltic, and Norwegian Viking presence in Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial foreign European ancestry entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. We also find that several of the members of the only archaeologically well-attested Viking expedition were close family members. By comparing Viking Scandinavian genomes with present-day Scandinavian genomes, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the last millennia. Finally, we are able to trace the allele frequency dynamics of positively selected loci with unprecedented detail, including the lactase persistence allele and various alleles associated with the immune response.

In reality, some Bacteria and Archaea do not share this canonical rRNA arrangement-their 16S and 23S rRNA genes are not co-located, but are instead separated across the genome and referred to as “unlinked”. This rearrangement has previously been treated as a rare exception or a byproduct of genome degradation in obligate intracellular bacteria. Here, we leverage complete genome and long-read metagenomic data to show that unlinked 16S and 23S rRNA genes are much more common than previously thought. Unlinked rRNA genes occur in many phyla, most significantly within Deinococcus-Thermus, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Euryarchaeota, and occur in differential frequencies across natural environments. We found that up to 41% of the taxa in soil, including dominant taxa, had unlinked rRNA genes, in contrast to the human gut, where all sequenced rRNA genes were linked. The frequency of unlinked rRNA genes may reflect meaningful life history traits, as they tend to be associated with a mix of slow-growing free-living species and obligatory intracellular species. Unlinked rRNA genes are also associated with changes in RNA metabolism, notably the loss of RNaseIII.

However, it has been largely excluded from the human genomics sequencing boom of the last decade. To serve as a benchmark dataset of molecular phenotypes across the region, we generated genome-wide CpG methylation and gene expression measurements in over 100 individuals from three locations that capture the major genomic and geographical axes of diversity across the Indonesian archipelago. Investigating between- and within-island differences, we find up to 10% of tested genes are differentially expressed between the islands of Mentawai (Sumatra) and New Guinea. Variation in gene expression is closely associated with DNA methylation, with expression levels of 9.7% of genes strongly correlating with nearby CpG methylation, and many of these genes being differentially expressed between islands. Genes identified in our differential expression and methylation analyses are enriched in pathways involved in immunity, highlighting Indonesia tropical role as a source of infectious disease diversity and the strong selective pressures these diseases have exerted on humans. Finally, we identify robust within-island variation in DNA methylation and gene expression, likely driven by very local environmental differences across sampling sites. Together, these results strongly suggest complex relationships between DNA methylation, transcription, archaic hominin introgression and immunity, all jointly shaped by the environment.

Inference of population structure is highly important in molecular epidemiology where pathogen phylogenetics is increasingly used to infer transmission patterns and detect outbreaks. Discrepancies between observed and idealised genealogies, such as those generated by the coalescent process, can be quantified, and where significant differences occur, may reveal the action of natural selection, host population structure, or other demographic and epidemiological heterogeneities. We have developed a fast non-parametric statistical test for detection of cryptic population structure in time-scaled phylogenetic trees. The test is based on contrasting estimated phylogenies with the theoretically expected phylodynamic ordering of common ancestors in two clades within a coalescent framework. These statistical tests have also motivated the development of algorithms which can be used to quickly screen a phylogenetic tree for clades which are likely to share a distinct demographic or epidemiological history. Epidemiological applications include identification of outbreaks in vulnerable host populations or rapid expansion of genotypes with a fitness advantage. To demonstrate the utility of these methods for outbreak detection, we applied the new methods to large phylogenies reconstructed from thousands of HIV-1 partial pol sequences. This revealed the presence of clades which had grown rapidly in the recent past, and was significantly concentrated in young men, suggesting recent and rapid transmission in that group. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of these methods for the study of antimicrobial resistance, we applied the new methods to a large phylogeny reconstructed from whole genome Neisseria gonorrhoeae sequences.

Here we use simultaneous large-scale recordings in the cortex and the striatum to show that striatal activity can be accurately predicted by spatiotemporal activity patterns in the cortex. The relationship between activity in the cortex and the striatum was spatially consistent with corticostriatal anatomy, and temporally consistent with a feedforward drive. Each striatal domain exhibited specific sensorimotor responses that predictably followed activity in the associated cortical regions, and the corticostriatal relationship remained unvaried during passive states or performance of a task probing visually guided behavior. However, the task’s visual stimuli and corresponding behavioral responses evoked relatively more activity in the striatum than in associated cortical regions. This increased striatal activity involved an additive offset in firing rate, which was independent of task engagement but only present in animals that had learned the task. Thus, striatal activity largely reflects patterns of cortical activity, deviating from them in a simple additive fashion for learned stimuli or actions.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Striatal activity reflects cortical activity patterns, bioRxiv, 2019-07-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/striatal_activity_reflects_cortical_activity_patterns_63627968/"},{"date":"2019-07-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or ‘blue zones’, has generated considerable scientific interest.

Typically, detection of adaptive introgression from genomic data relies on comparative analyses that require sequence data from both the recipient and the donor species. However, in many cases, the donor is unknown or the data is not currently available. Here, we introduce a genome-scan method—VolcanoFinder—to detect recent events of adaptive introgression using polymorphism data from the recipient species only.VolcanoFinder detects adaptive introgression sweeps from the pattern of excess intermediate-frequency polymorphism they produce in the flanking region of the genome, a pattern which appears as a volcano-shape in pairwise genetic diversity.Using coalescent theory, we derive analytical predictions for these patterns. Based on these results, we develop a composite-likelihood test to detect signatures of adaptive introgression relative to the genomic background. Simulation results show that VolcanoFinder has high statistical power to detect these signatures, even for older sweeps and for soft sweeps initiated by multiple migrant haplotypes. Finally, we implement VolcanoFinder to detect archaic introgression in European and sub-Saharan African human populations, and uncovered interesting candidates in both populations, such as TSHR in Europeans and TCHH-RPTN in Africans. We discuss their biological implications and provide guidelines for identifying and circumventing artifactual signals during empirical applications of VolcanoFinder.Author summaryThe process by which beneficial alleles are introduced into a species from a closely-related species is termed adaptive introgression. We present an analytically-tractable model for the effects of adaptive introgression on non-adaptive genetic variation in the genomic region surrounding the beneficial allele. The result we describe is a characteristic volcano-shaped pattern of increased variability that arises around the positively-selected site, and we introduce an open-source method VolcanoFinder to detect this signal in genomic data. Importantly, VolcanoFinder is a population-genetic likelihood-based approach, rather than a comparative-genomic approach, and can therefore probe genomic variation data from a single population for footprints of adaptive introgression, even from a priori unknown and possibly extinct donor species.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"VolcanoFinder genomic scans for adaptive introgression, bioRxiv, 2019-07-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/volcanofinder_genomic_scans_for_adaptive_introgression_63431068/"},{"date":"2019-07-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe recently discovered that C. elegans can pass on a learned avoidance of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) to four generations of its progeny.

Here we show that small RNAs purified from pathogenic PA14 are sufficient not only to induce avoidance of pathogens in mothers, but also to confer transgenerational inheritance of this species-specific behavior for four generations, all without direct contact with pathogenic bacteria. This behavior requires the small RNA transporters SID-1 and SID-2, RNA interference pathway components, the piRNA PiwiArgonaute pathway, a functioning germline, and TGF-β ligand daf-7 expression in the ASI sensory neuron.

We found that this glycan-mediated iron endocytosis mechanism is enhanced during epithelial-mesenchymal transition, unlike the canonical transferrin-dependent pathway. This transition is further characterized by molecular changes required for iron-catalyzed oxidative demethylation of the repressive histone mark H3K9me2 that governs the expression of mesenchymal genes. CD44 itself is transcriptionally regulated by nuclear iron, demonstrating a positive feedback loop, which is in contrast to the negative regulation of transferrin receptor by excess iron.

RNA velocity, which infers immediate changes in gene expression by comparing levels of new (unspliced) versus mature (spliced) transcripts (La Manno et al. 2018), represents an important advance to these efforts. A key question remaining is whether it is possible to predict the most probable cell state backward or forward over arbitrary time-scales. To this end, we introduce an inclusive model (termed Dynamo) capable of predicting cell states over extended time periods, that incorporates promoter state switching, transcription, splicing, translation and RNAprotein degradation by taking advantage of scRNA-seq and the co-assay of transcriptome and proteome. We also implement scSLAM-seq by extending SLAM-seq to plate-based scRNA-seq (Hendriks et al. 2018; Erhard et al. 2019; Cao, Zhou, et al. 2019) and augment the model by explicitly incorporating the metabolic labelling of nascent RNA. We show that through careful design of labelling experiments and an efficient mathematical framework, the entire kinetic behavior of a cell from this model can be robustly and accurately inferred. Aided by the improved framework, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the transcriptomic vector field from sparse and noisy vector samples generated by single cell experiments. The reconstructed vector field further enables global mapping of potential landscapes that reflects the relative stability of a given cell state, and the minimal transition time and most probable paths between any cell states in the state space.

However, molecular tests for HPV and EBV are not ubiquitously available.We hypothesized that the histopathological features of virus-driven and non-virus driven cancers are sufficiently different to be detectable by artificial intelligence (AI) through deep learning-based analysis of images from routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained slides. We show that deep transfer learning can predict presence of HPV in head and neck cancer with a patient-level 3-fold cross validated area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.89 [0.82; 0.94]. The same workflow was used for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) driven gastric cancer achieving a cross-validated AUC of 0.80 [0.70; 0.92] and a similar performance in external validation sets. Reverse-engineering our deep neural networks, we show that the key morphological features can be made understandable to humans.This workflow could enable a fast and low-cost method to identify virus-induced cancer in clinical trials or clinical routine. At the same time, our approach for feature visualization allows pathologists to look into the black box of deep learning, enabling them to check the plausibility of computer-based image classification.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Deep learning detects virus presence in cancer histology, bioRxiv, 2019-07-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/deep_learning_detects_virus_presence_in_cancer_histology_63190390/"},{"date":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAging manifests itself through a decline in organismal homeostasis and a multitude of cellular and physiological functions1. Efforts to identify a common basis for vertebrate aging face many challenges; for example, while there have been documented changes in the expression of many hundreds of mRNAs, the results across tissues and species have been inconsistent2. We therefore analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from 17 mouse organs and 51 human organs using unsupervised machine learning3–5 to identify the architectural and regulatory characteristics most informative on the differential expression of genes with age. We report a hitherto unknown phenomenon, a systemic age-dependent length-driven transcriptome imbalance that for older organisms disrupts the homeostatic balance between short and long transcript molecules for mice, rats, killifishes, and humans. We also demonstrate that in a mouse model of healthy aging, length-driven transcriptome imbalance correlates with changes in expression of splicing factor proline and glutamine rich (Sfpq), which regulates transcriptional elongation according to gene length6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that length-driven transcriptome imbalance can be triggered by environmental hazards and pathogens. Our findings reinforce the picture of aging as a systemic homeostasis breakdown and suggest a promising explanation for why diverse insults affect multiple age-dependent phenotypes in a similar manner.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Aging is associated with a systemic length-driven transcriptome imbalance, bioRxiv, 2019-07-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/aging_is_associated_with_a_systemic_length-driven_transcriptome_imbalance_63103929/"},{"date":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractParasexuality contributes to diversity and adaptive evolution of haploid (monokaryotic) fungi.

Most subtyping studies divide ASD individuals into non-overlapping (categorical) subgroups. However, continuous inter-individual variation in ASD suggests the need for a dimensional approach.MethodsA Bayesian model was employed to decompose resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of ASD individuals into multiple abnormal RSFC patterns, i.e., categorical subtypes henceforth referred to as “factors”. Importantly, the model allowed each individual to express one or more factors to varying degrees (dimensional subtyping). The model was applied to 306 ASD individuals (age 5.2-57 years) from two multisite repositories. Posthoc analyses associated factors with symptoms and demographics.ResultsAnalyses yielded three factors with dissociable whole-brain hypohyper RSFC patterns. Most participants expressed multiple (categorical) factors, suggestive of a mosaic of subtypes within individuals. All factors shared abnormal RSFC involving the default network, but the directionality (hypohyper RSFC) differed across factors. Factor 1 was associated with core ASD symptoms, while factor 2 was associated with comorbid symptoms. Older males preferentially expressed factor 3. Factors were robust across multiple control analyses and not associated with IQ, nor head motion.ConclusionsThere exist at least three ASD factors with dissociable patterns of whole-brain RSFC, behaviors and demographics. Heterogeneous default network hypohyper RSFC across the factors might explain previously reported inconsistencies. The factors differentiated between core ASD and comorbid symptoms - a less appreciated domain of heterogeneity in ASD.

With very little direct biological data of HIV-1 from before the 1980s, far-reaching evolutionary and epidemiological inferences regarding the long pre-discovery phase of this pandemic are based on extrapolations by phylodynamic models of HIV-1 genomic sequences gathered mostly over recent decades. Here, using a very sensitive multiplex RT-PCR assay, we screened 1,652 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens collected for pathology diagnostics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), between 1959 and 1967. We report the near-complete genome of one positive from 1966 (“DRC66”)—a non-recombinant sister lineage to subtype C that constitutes the oldest HIV-1 near-full-length genome recovered to date. Root-to-tip plots showed the DRC66 sequence is not an outlier as would be expected if dating estimates from more recent genomes were systematically biased; and inclusion of DRC66 sequence in tip-dated BEAST analyses did not significantly alter root and internal node age estimates based on post-1978 HIV-1 sequences. There was larger variation in divergence time estimates among datasets that were subsamples of the available HIV-1 genomes from 1978-2015, showing the inherent phylogenetic stochasticity across subsets of the real HIV-1 diversity. In conclusion, this unique archival HIV-1 sequence provides direct genomic insight into HIV-1 in 1960s DRC, and, as an ancient-DNA calibrator, it validates our understanding of HIV-1 evolutionary history.SignificanceInferring the precise timing of the origin of the HIVAIDS pandemic is of great importance because it offers insights into which factors did—or did not—facilitate the emergence of the causal virus. Previous estimates have implicated rapid development during the early 20th century in Central Africa, which wove once-isolated populations into a more continuous fabric. We recovered the first HIV-1 genome from the 1960s, and it provides direct evidence that HIV-1 molecular clock estimates spanning the last half-century are remarkably reliable. And, because this genome itself was sampled only about a half-century after the estimated origin of the pandemic, it empirically anchors this crucial inference with high confidence.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"A near-full-length HIV-1 genome from 1966 recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, bioRxiv, 2019-07-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_near-full-length_hiv-1_genome_from_1966_recovered_from_formalin-fixed_paraffin-embedded_tissue_62939704/"},{"date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMany eukaryotic microbes have complex lifecycles that include both sexual and asexual phases with strict species-specificity. While the asexual cycle of the protistan parasite Toxoplasma gondii can occur in any warm-blooded mammal, the sexual cycle is restricted to the feline intestine1. The molecular determinants that identify cats as the definitive host for T. gondii are unknown. Here, we defined the mechanism of species specificity for T. gondii sexual development and break the species barrier to allow the sexual cycle to occur in mice. We determined that T. gondii sexual development occurs when cultured feline intestinal epithelial cells are supplemented with linoleic acid. Felines are the only mammals that lack delta-6-desaturase activity in their intestines, which is required for linoleic acid metabolism, resulting in systemic excess of linoleic acid2, 3. We found that inhibition of murine delta-6-desaturase and supplementation of their diet with linoleic acid allowed T. gondii sexual development in mice. This mechanism of species specificity is the first defined for a parasite sexual cycle. This work highlights how host diet and metabolism shape coevolution with microbes. The key to unlocking the species boundaries for other eukaryotic microbes may also rely on the lipid composition of their environments as we see increasing evidence for the importance of host lipid metabolism during parasitic lifecycles4, 5. Pregnant women are advised against handling cat litter as maternal infection with T. gondii can be transmitted to the fetus with potentially lethal outcomes. Knowing the molecular components that create a conducive environment for T. gondii sexual reproduction will allow for development of therapeutics that prevent shedding of T. gondii parasites. Finally, given the current reliance on companion animals to study T. gondii sexual development, this work will allow the T. gondii field to use of alternative models in future studies.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Intestinal delta-6-desaturase activity determines host range for Toxoplasma sexual reproduction, bioRxiv, 2019-07-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/intestinal_delta-6-desaturase_activity_determines_host_range_for_toxoplasma_sexual_reproduction_62936604/"},{"date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe sequencing of Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes has yielded many new insights about interbreeding events between extinct hominins and the ancestors of modern humans. While much attention has been paid to the relatively recent gene flow from Neanderthals and Denisovans into modern humans, other instances of introgression leave more subtle genomic evidence and have received less attention. Here, we present an extended version of the ARGweaver algorithm, ARGweaver-D, which can infer local genetic relationships under a user-defined demographic model that includes population splits and migration events. This Bayesian algorithm probabilistically samples ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) that specify not only tree topology and branch lengths along the genome, but also indicate migrant lineages. The sampled ARGs can therefore be parsed to produce probabilities of introgression along the genome. We show that this method is well powered to detect the archaic migration into modern humans, even with only a few samples. We then show that the method can also detect introgressed regions stemming from older migration events, or from unsampled populations. We apply it to human, Neanderthal, and Denisovan genomes, looking for signatures of older proposed migration events, including ancient humans into Neanderthal, and unknown archaic hominins into Denisovans. We identify 3% of the Neanderthal genome that is putatively introgressed from ancient humans, and estimate that the gene flow occurred between 200-300kya. We find no convincing evidence that negative selection acted against these regions. We also identify 1% of the Denisovan genome which was likely introgressed from an unsequenced hominin ancestor, and note that 15% of these regions have been passed on to modern humans through subsequent gene flow.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Mapping gene flow between ancient hominins through demography-aware inference of the ancestral recombination graph, bioRxiv, 2019-07-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/mapping_gene_flow_between_ancient_hominins_through_demography-aware_inference_of_the_ancestral_recombination_graph_62921313/"},{"date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMiniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) have been instrumental to monitor neural activity during unrestrained behavior and their open-source versions have helped to distribute them at an affordable cost.

In the main analysis, we identified 298 distinct association signals at 178 loci, and across T2D association models with and without consideration of body mass index and sex, we identified 56 loci newly implicated in T2D predisposition. Common variants associated with T2D in both East Asian and European populations exhibited strongly correlated effect sizes. New associations include signals innear GDAP1, PTF1A, SIX3, ALDH2, a microRNA cluster, and genes that affect muscle and adipose differentiation. At another locus, eQTLs at two overlapping T2D signals act through two genes, NKX6-3 and ANK1, in different tissues. Association studies in diverse populations identify additional loci and elucidate disease genes, biology, and pathways.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common metabolic disease primarily caused by insufficient insulin production andor secretion by the pancreatic β cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues1.

Knockout of Polκ dramatically exacerbates the mutagenicity of alkylating agents; conversely, Polζ deficiency reduces alkylation- and UV-induced substitution rates.

Despite its broad evolutionary interest, mtDNA is rarely assembled and used in conjunction with nuclear markers in capture-based studies. Here, we developed MitoFinder, a user-friendly bioinformatic pipeline, to efficiently assemble and annotate mitogenomic data from hundreds of UCE libraries. As a case study, we used ants (Formicidae) for which 501 UCE libraries have been sequenced whereas only 29 mitogenomes are available. We compared the efficiency of four different assemblers (IDBA-UD, MEGAHIT, MetaSPAdes, and Trinity) for assembling both UCE and mtDNA loci. Using MitoFinder, we show that metagenomic assemblers, in particular MetaSPAdes, are well suited to assemble both UCEs and mtDNA. Mitogenomic signal was successfully extracted from all 501 UCE libraries allowing confirming species identification using COI barcoding. Moreover, our automated procedure retrieved 296 cases in which the mitochondrial genome was assembled in a single contig, thus increasing the number of available ant mitogenomes by an order of magnitude. By leveraging the power of metagenomic assemblers, MitoFinder provides an efficient tool to extract complementary mitogenomic data from UCE libraries, allowing testing for potential mito-nuclear discordance.

We first analyze cell composition and reconstruct differentiation trajectories over the entire course of human cerebral organoid development from pluripotency, through neuroectoderm and neuroepithelial stages, followed by divergence into neuronal fates within the dorsal and ventral forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain regions. We find that brain region composition varies in organoids from different iPSC lines, yet regional gene expression patterns are largely reproducible across individuals. We then analyze chimpanzee and macaque cerebral organoids and find that human neuronal development proceeds at a delayed pace relative to the other two primates. Through pseudotemporal alignment of differentiation paths, we identify human-specific gene expression resolved to distinct cell states along progenitor to neuron lineages in the cortex.

With serial electron microscopy we annotated all the input synapses (862) and output synapses (626) associated with one inhibitory interneuron in the visual thalamus of the mouse. This neuron’s neurites covered a broad swath of lateral geniculate nucleus and spanned multiple functionally distinct regions. Every one of its neurites formed synapses onto hundreds of thalamocortical cells of several different types. All but one small neurite also had dendrite-like properties and received input from retinal ganglion cell axons. Pre- and postsynaptic associations with other inhibitory interneurons were also distributed throughout the interneuron’s territory. We observed a diverse array of local synaptic motifs and three fundamentally different types of inhibitory neurites. Many thalamocortical cells were innervated weakly by this interneuron by single en passant shaft synapses. But a subset of the interneuron’s thalamocortical cell targets received multiple synaptic inputs from targeted inhibitory neurites that climbed along the thalamocortical cell’s dendrite with an assemblage of fasciculated retinal ganglion cell axons. Because of the diverse range of synaptic relationships exhibited by this one neuron, this cell defies a single functional label and seems rather to be using extremely local synaptic processing to participate in many different functions.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"An individual interneuron participates in many kinds of inhibition and spans much of the mouse visual thalamus, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/an_individual_interneuron_participates_in_many_kinds_of_inhibition_and_spans_much_of_the_mouse_visual_thalamus_62771066/"},{"date":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTThe consolidation and retrieval of remote memories depend on the coordinated activity of the hippocampus and frontal cortices. However, the exact time at which these regions are recruited to support memory and the interactions between them are still debated. Astrocytes can sense and modify neuronal activity with great precision, but their role in cognitive function has not been extensively explored. To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying remote memory involves projection-specific functions of astrocytes in regulating neuronal activity.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Astrocytes Contribute to Remote Memory Formation by Modulating Hippocampal-Cortical Communication During Learning, bioRxiv, 2019-06-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/astrocytes_contribute_to_remote_memory_formation_by_modulating_hippocampal-cortical_communication_during_learning_62732928/"},{"date":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","description":"Condensin, a key member of the Structure Maintenance of Chromosome (SMC) protein complexes, has recently been shown to be a motor that extrudes loops of DNA1.

We find that these one-side-pulling motor proteins are able to dynamically change each other’s DNA loop sizes, even when located large distances apart. When coming into close proximity upon forming a loop within a loop, condensin complexes are, surprisingly, able to traverse each other and form a new type of loop structure, which we term Z loop – three double-stranded DNA helices aligned in parallel with one condensin at each edge. These Z-loops can fill gaps left by single loops and can form symmetric dimer motors that reel in DNA from both sides.

However, the sources of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumour tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNAseq, are not well understood. Here, we used low temperature (6°C) protease and collagenase (37°C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNAseq dataset comprising 128,481 cells from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and cancer cell lines.ResultsWe observe substantial variation in standard quality control (QC) metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From FACS sorted populations gated for cell viability, we identify a sub-population of dead cells that would pass standard data filtering practices, and quantify the extent to which their transcriptomes differ from live cells. We identify a further subpopulation of transcriptomically “dying” cells that exhibit up-regulation of MHC class I transcripts, in contrast with live and fully dead cells. From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37°C or 6°C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37°C), which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6°C). While induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient tissues. We observe that the yield of cancer and non-cancer cell types varies between tissues and dissociation methods.ConclusionsThe method and conditions of tumour dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue and cell type dependent. Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single cell studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, may be especially confounded.

The prevailing approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, which is often equated with fitness. Increasingly, this is being done using genetic rescue, where individuals from populations with high genetic diversity are translocated to small populations with high levels of inbreeding. However, the potentially negative consequences of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which only briefly recovered after genetic rescue by a migrant from the large mainland wolf population and then declined to the brink of extinction. Here, we use ecologically-motivated population genetic simulations to show that extinction risk in small populations is often increased by maximizing genetic diversity but is consistently decreased by minimizing deleterious variation. Surprisingly, we find that small populations that are founded or rescued by individuals from large populations with high genetic diversity have an elevated risk of extinction due to the high levels of recessive deleterious variation harbored by large populations. By contrast, we show that genetic rescue or founding from small or moderate-sized populations leads to decreased extinction risk due to greater purging of strongly deleterious variants. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on genetic diversity in assessing extinction risk in favor of a new view that emphasizes minimizing deleterious variation.

How-ever, failure or inability to withstand to these extreme strains can result in epithelial fractures5, 6 and associated diseases7, 8. From a materials science perspective, how properties of living cells and their interactions prescribe larger scale tissue rheology and adaptive response in dynamic force landscapes remains an important frontier9. Motivated by pushing tissues to the limits of their integrity, we carry out a multi-modal study of a simple yet highly dynamic organism, the Trichoplax Adhaerens10–12, across four orders of magnitude in length (1 µm to 10 mm), and six orders in time (0.1 sec to 10 hours). We report the discovery of abrupt, bulk epithelial tissue fractures (∼10 sec) induced by the organism’s own motility. Coupled with rapid healing (∼10 min), this discovery accounts for dramatic shape change and physiological asexual division in this early-divergent metazoan.

We thus detail a log-normal-Poisson (LNP) background model that accounts for variation in site-specific mutability in a manner consistent with models of mutagenesis, use this model to show that the tendency to generate passenger hotspots pervades all common mutational processes, and apply it to a ~10, 000 patient cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas to nominate driver hotspots with far fewer false positives compared to conventional methods.

However, this is typically incomplete and biased towards the goals of individual investigations.ResultsWe present a general framework for standardized and structured benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization, and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression data sets investigating 42 different human diseases. The compendium features microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is associated with a precompiled GOKEGG relevance ranking for the corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods on the benchmark compendium, identifying significant differences in (i) runtime and applicability to RNA-seq data, (ii) fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the type of null hypothesis tested, and (iii) recovery of the a priori defined relevance rankings. Based on these findings, we make practical recommendations on (i) how methods originally developed for microarray data can efficiently be applied to RNA-seq data, (ii) how to interpret results depending on the type of gene set test conducted, and (iii) which methods are best suited to effectively prioritize gene sets with high relevance for the phenotype investigated.ConclusionWe carried out a systematic assessment of existing enrichment methods, and identified best performing methods, but also general shortcomings in how gene set analysis is currently conducted.

Studies of acute viral and bacterial infection suggest that memory CD4+ T cells develop directly from effectors. However, delineating these dynamic developmental pathways has been challenging. Here, we used high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq and temporal mixture modelling to examine the fate of Th1 and Tfh effector cells during non-lethal Plasmodium infection in mice. We observed linear Th1 and Tfh pathways towards memory, characterized by progressive halving in the numbers of genes expressed, and partial transcriptomic coalescence. Low-level persisting infection diverted but did not block these pathways. We observed in the Th1-pathway a linear transition from Th1 through a Tr1 state to TEM cells, which were then poised for Th1 re-call. The Tfh-pathway exhibited a modest Th1-signature throughout, with little evidence of Tr1 development, and co-expression of TCM and memory Tfh markers. Thus, we present a high-resolution atlas of transcriptome dynamics for naïve to memory transitions in CD4+ T cells. We also defined a subset of memory-associated genes, including transcription factors Id2 and Maf, whose expression increased progressively against the background of transcriptomic quiescence. Single-cell ATAC-seq revealed substantial heterogeneity in chromatin accessibility in single effectors, which was extensively, though incompletely reset and homogenized in memory.

Zebrafish larvae swim in punctuated bouts separated by longer periods of rest called interbout intervals. We take advantage of this structure by categorizing bouts into discrete types and representing their behavior as labeled sequences of bout-types emitted over time. We then construct probabilistic models – specifically, marked renewal processes – to evaluate how bout-types and interbout intervals are selected by the fish as a function of its internal hunger state, behavioral history, and the locations and properties of nearby prey. Finally, we evaluate the models by their predictive likelihood and their ability to generate realistic trajectories of virtual fish swimming through simulated environments.

Illusions are thought to arise from lower-level processes within sensory cortices. In contrast, imagery involves a wide network of brain areas that recruit early visual cortices for the sensory representation of the imagined stimulus. Here, we combine laminar fMRI brain imaging with psychophysical methods and multivariate pattern analysis to investigate in human participants how seemingly ‘real’ and imaginary non-physical experiences are processed in primary visual cortex (V1). We find that the content of mental imagery is only decodable in deep layers, whereas illusory content is only decodable at superficial depths. This suggests that feedback to the different layers may serve distinct functions low-level feedback to superficial layers might be responsible for shaping perception-like experiences, while deep-layer feedback might serve the formation of a more malleable ‘inner’ world, separate from ongoing perception.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Two distinct feedback codes in V1 for ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’ internal experiences, bioRxiv, 2019-06-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/two_distinct_feedback_codes_in_v1_for_real_and_imaginary_internal_experiences_62047510/"},{"date":"2019-06-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe domestic pig (Sus scrofa) is important both as a food source and as a biomedical model with high anatomical and immunological similarity to humans.

We performed CTCF ChIP-seq in multiple mouse species to create genome-wide binding profiles and associated them with TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding is maintained at TAD boundaries by an equilibrium of selective constraints and dynamic evolutionary processes. Regardless of their conservation across species, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are subject to stronger sequence and functional constraints compared to other CTCF sites. TAD boundaries frequently harbor rapidly evolving clusters containing both evolutionary old and young CTCF sites as a result of repeated acquisition of new species-specific sites close to conserved ones. The overwhelming majority of clustered CTCF sites colocalize with cohesin and are significantly closer to gene transcription start sites than nonclustered CTCF sites, suggesting that CTCF clusters particularly contribute to cohesin stabilization and transcriptional regulation.

This has led to the development of environmental policies supporting pollinators in urban areas. However, policies are often restricted to the promotion of honey bee colony installations, which resulted in a strong increase in apiary numbers in cities. Recently, competition for floral resources between wild pollinators and honey bees has been highlighted in semi-natural contexts, but whether urban beekeeping could impact wild pollinators remains unknown. Here, we show that in the city of Paris (France), wild pollinator visitation rates is negatively correlated to honey bee colony densities present in the surrounding (500m – slope = −0.614; p = 0.001 – and 1000m – slope = −0.489; p = 0.005). More particularly, large solitary bees and beetles were significantly affected at 500m (respectively slope = −0.425, p = 0.007 and slope = - 0.671, p = 0.002) and bumblebees were significantly affected at 1000m (slope = - 0.451, p = 0.012). Further, lower interaction evenness in plant-pollinator networks was observed with honey bee colony densities within 1000 meter buffers (slope = −0.487, p = 0.008). Finally, honey bees tended to focus their foraging activity on managed rather than spontaneous plant species (student t-test, p = 0.001) whereas wild pollinators equally visited managed and spontaneous species.

Furthermore, activating Wnt signaling in subpopulations of ESCs in 2D and 3D cultures induced cell self-organization and morphogenesis reminiscent of human gastrulation, including changes in cell migration and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our findings thus reveal an instructive role for Wnt in directing cell patterning in this ESC model for gastrulation.","tags":["biorxiv","bioengineering","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Optogenetic control of Wnt signaling for modeling early embryogenic patterning with human pluripotent stem cells, bioRxiv, 2019-06-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/optogenetic_control_of_wnt_signaling_for_modeling_early_embryogenic_patterning_with_human_pluripotent_stem_cells_61878281/"},{"date":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","description":"The fate and physiology of individual cells are controlled by protein interactions. Yet, our ability to quantitatively analyze proteins in single cells has remained limited. To overcome this barrier, we developed SCoPE2. It lowers cost and hands-on time by introducing automated and miniaturized sample preparation while substantially increasing quantitative accuracy. These advances enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiated into macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantified over 2,700 proteins in 1,018 single monocytes and macrophages in ten days of instrument time, and the quantified proteins allowed us to discern single cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncovered a continuous gradient of proteome states for the macrophage-like cells, suggesting that macrophage heterogeneity may emerge even in the absence of polarizing cytokines. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10x Genomics scRNA-seq suggest that SCoPE2 samples 20-fold more copies per gene, thus supporting quantification with improved count statistics. Joint analysis of the data indicated that most genes had similar responses at the protein and RNA levels, though the responses of hundreds of genes differed.

This transport across the entire airway emerges from the integrated activity of thousands of multiciliated cells, each containing hundreds of cilia, which together must coordinate their spatial arrangement, alignment and motility [2, 3]. The mechanisms of fluid transport have been studied extensively at the level of an individual cilium [4, 5], collectively moving metachronal waves [6–10], and more generally the hydrodynamics of active matter [11, 12]. However, the connection between local cilia architecture and the topology of the flows they generate remains largely unexplored. Here, we image the mouse airway from the sub-cellular (nm) to the organ scales (mm), characterising quantitatively its ciliary arrangement and the generated flows. Locally we measure heterogeneity in both cilia organisation and flow structure, but across the trachea fluid transport is coherent. To examine this result, a hydrodynamic model was developed for a systematic exploration of different tissue architectures. Surprisingly, we find that disorder enhances particle clearance, whether it originates from fluctuations, heterogeneity in multiciliated cell arrangement or ciliary misalignment. This resembles elements of ‘stochastic resonance’ [13–15] in a self-assembled biological system. Taken together, our results shed light on how the microstructure of an active carpet [16, 17] determines its emergent dynamics. Furthermore, this work is also directly applicable to human airway pathologies [1], which are the third leading cause of deaths worldwide [18].","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Multi-scale spatial heterogeneity enhances particle clearance in airway ciliary arrays, bioRxiv, 2019-06-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/multi-scale_spatial_heterogeneity_enhances_particle_clearance_in_airway_ciliary_arrays_61877693/"},{"date":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death 1.

A PCA on data from 1225 respondents revealed four management strategies (i.e. interventions during firework exposure) the principal components “Environmental modification” (e.g. providing a hiding place, keeping windows and blinds closed, and playing music), “FeedPlay” (providing the dog with chews, play and food during fireworks in general, as well as contingent on loud bangs), “Alternative” (use of calming neutraceuticals, pheromones, herbal products, homeopathic products, Bach flowers, and essential oils) and “Interaction” (allowing body contact, petting and talking to the dog when loud bangs occurred). To explore possible effects of these management methods on fear development, the components were correlated with a score for fear progression. Of the four components, only “FeedPlay” was statistically associated with an improvement in fear responses to fireworks. To evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment strategies, owners were asked to select from a range of options which interventions they had used and whether they considered them as effective. With prescription medication (N=202), improvements were noted by 70% of owners. While individual products were not evaluated, the reported success rates for the categories “pheromones” (N=316), “herbal products” (N=282), “neutraceuticals” (N=211), “essential oils” (N=183), “homeopathic remedies” (N=250) and “Bach flowers” (N=281) were all in the range of 27-35%, which is not higher than would be expected based on a placebo effect. 44% of respondents (N=300) deemed pressure vests as effective. Counterconditioning (providing desirable stimuli after the occurrence of noises) was the most successful training technique according to the owners (N=694), with a reported effectiveness of over 70%. Relaxation training (N=433) was reported to be almost as successful at 69%, while noise CDs (N=377) were effective in 55% of cases. Thus, counterconditioining, relaxation training and psychoactive medication appear to be the most effective strategies in the treatment of firework fears in dogs.

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) citrullinates histones and is required for NET formation (NETosis) in mouse neutrophils. While the in vivo impact of NETs is accumulating, the cellular events driving NETosis and the role of PAD4 in these events are unclear. We performed high resolution time-lapse microscopy of mouse and human neutrophils (PMN) and differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) labelled with fluorescent markers of organelles and stimulated with ionomycin or lipopolysaccharides to induce NETosis. Upon stimulation, cells exhibited rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, followed by shedding of plasma membrane microvesicles, disassembly and remodeling of the microtubule and vimentin cytoskeletons, ER vesiculation, chromatin de-condensation and nuclear rounding, progressive plasma membrane and nuclear envelope (NE) permeabilization, nuclear lamin meshwork and then NE rupture to release DNA into the cytoplasm, and finally plasma membrane rupture and discharge of extracellular DNA. Inhibition of actin disassembly blocked NET release. Mouse and dHL-60 cells bearing genetic alteration of PAD4 showed that chromatin de-condensation, lamin meshwork and NE rupture and extracellular DNA release required the enzymatic and nuclear localization activities of PAD4. Thus, NETosis proceeds by a step-wise sequence of cellular events culminating in the PAD4-mediated expulsion of DNA.Significance StatementNeutrophils are white blood cells specialized as the first line of host defense in the immune system. One way they protect organisms is through NETosis, in which they expel their DNA to form a web-like trap that ensnares pathogens and promotes clotting. However, NETs also mediate sterile inflammation, causing damage to the body. We used high-resolution live-cell microscopy to perform the first systematic characterization of the timing of dynamic cellular events leading to NETosis in human and mouse neutrophils and a neutrophil-like cell line.

While the field has identified major categories of aging damage such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis, and eroded mitochondrial function1, these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs. Yet, a comprehensive analysis of aging dynamics organism-wide is lacking. Here we performed RNA-sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the mouse lifespan. We uncover previously unknown linear and non-linear expression shifts during aging, which cluster in strikingly consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions, including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Remarkably, these gene sets are expressed similarly across tissues, differing merely in age of onset and amplitude. Especially pronounced is widespread immune cell activation, detectable first in white adipose depots in middle age. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirms the accumulation of adipose T and B cells, including immunoglobulin J-expressing plasma cells, which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to aging of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of aging, thereby providing a foundation to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The murine transcriptome reveals global aging nodes with organ-specific phase and amplitude, bioRxiv, 2019-06-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_murine_transcriptome_reveals_global_aging_nodes_with_organ-specific_phase_and_amplitude_61878680/"},{"date":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/about/"},{"date":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractClinical laboratory tests are a critical component of the continuum of care and provide a means for rapid diagnosis and monitoring of chronic disease.

To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework.

In this study, fungi were cultured from the marine environment in the vicinity of Woods Hole, MA, USA including from plankton, sponge and coral. Our sampling resulted in 36 unique species across 20 genera. We observed many isolates by time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy and analyzed modes of growth and division. Several black yeasts displayed highly unconventional cell division cycles compared to those of traditional model yeast systems. Black yeasts have been found in habitats inhospitable to other life and are known for halotolerance, virulence, and stress-resistance. We find that this group of yeasts also shows remarkable plasticity in terms of cell size control, modes of cell division, and cell polarity. Unexpected behaviors include division through a combination of fission and budding, production of multiple simultaneous buds, and cell division by sequential orthogonal septations.

The origin of this revolution was arguably the deep learning approach by the Hinton lab in 2012, which halved the error rate of existing classifiers in the then 2-year-old ImageNet database1. In hindsight, the combination of algorithmic and hardware advances with the appearance of large and well-labeled datasets has led up to this seminal contribution.The emergence of large amounts of data from single-cell RNA-seq and the recent global effort to chart all cell types in the Human Cell Atlas has attracted an interest in deep-learning applications. However, all current approaches are unsupervised, i.e., learning of latent spaces without using any cell labels, even though supervised learning approaches are often more powerful in feature learning and the most popular approach in the current AI revolution by far.Here, we ask why this is the case. In particular we ask whether supervised deep learning can be used for cell annotation, i.e. to predict cell-type labels from single-cell gene expression profiles. After evaluating 6 classification methods across 14 datasets, we notably find that deep learning does not outperform classical machine-learning methods in the task. Thus, cell-type prediction based on gene-signature derived cell-type labels is potentially too simplistic a task for complex non-linear methods, which demands better labels of functional single-cell readouts. We, therefore, are still waiting for the “ImageNet moment” in single-cell genomics.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Deep learning does not outperform classical machine learning for cell-type annotation, bioRxiv, 2019-05-31","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/deep_learning_does_not_outperform_classical_machine_learning_for_cell-type_annotation_61335515/"},{"date":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundAccurately identifying SNPs from bacterial sequencing data is an essential requirement for using genomics to track transmission and predict important phenotypes such as antimicrobial resistance. However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained.This study evaluates the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines using simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally-sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia and Klebsiella.ResultsWe evaluated the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic, bacteria such as Escherichia coli, but less dominant for clonal species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.ConclusionsThe accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity. When reads were aligned to the same genome from which they were sequenced, among the highest performing pipelines was NovoalignGATK.

Recent scientific studies have demonstrated improved inference by aligning reads to a variation graph, i.e., a reference sequence augmented with known genetic variations. Given a variation graph in the form of a directed acyclic string graph, the sequence to graph alignment problem seeks to find the best matching path in the graph for an input query sequence. Solving this problem exactly using a sequential dynamic programming algorithm takes quadratic time in terms of the graph size and query length, making it difficult to scale to high throughput DNA sequencing data. In this work, we propose the first parallel algorithm for computing sequence to graph alignments that leverages multiple cores and single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. We take advantage of the available inter-task parallelism, and provide a novel blocked approach to compute the score matrix while ensuring high memory locality. Using a 48-core Intel Xeon Skylake processor, the proposed algorithm achieves peak performance of 317 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS), and demonstrates near linear weak and strong scaling on up to 48 cores. It delivers significant performance gains compared to existing algorithms, and results in run-time reduction from multiple days to three hours for the problem of optimally aligning high coverage long (PacBioONT) or short (Illumina) DNA reads to an MHC human variation graph containing 10 million vertices.AvailabilityThe implementation of our algorithm is available at \u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comParBLiSSPaSGAL\u003ehttpsgithub.comParBLiSSPaSGAL\u003cjatsext-link\u003e.

A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross-sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of MRI scanner hasn’t been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where the participants were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For a careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used in the prediction analysis. We first found that daylight length and temperatures could be reliability predicted using cross-validation using resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using segmented or even the raw anatomical images. Finally, we verified that the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the stability of MRI scanners.

Here, we survey for phenotypic and behavioral differences between a surface population and a cave population of A. mexicanus that has recently colonized Honey Creek Cave, Comal County, Texas, likely within the last century. We found that fish from Honey Creek Cave and fish from Honey Creek surface populations differ significantly in morphological traits including length, coloration, body condition, eye size, and dorsal fin placement. Cavefish also exhibit an increased number of superficial neuromasts relative to surface fish. Behaviorally, cavefish consume fewer worms when trials are performed in both lighted and darkened conditions. Cavefish are more aggressive than surface fish and exhibit fewer behaviors associated with stress. Further in contrast to surface fish, cavefish prefer the edges to the center of an arena and are qualitatively more likely to investigate a novel object placed in the tank. While cavefish and surface fish were wild-caught and developmental environment likely play a role in shaping these differences, our work demonstrates morphological and behavioral shifts for Texas cavefish and offers an exciting opportunity for future work to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to early cave colonization.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Evidence for rapid phenotypic and behavioral change in a recently established cavefish population, bioRxiv, 2019-05-28","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/evidence_for_rapid_phenotypic_and_behavioral_change_in_a_recently_established_cavefish_population_61186125/"},{"date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYMost tissue-resident macrophage (RTM) populations are seeded by waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and are self-maintained independently of a bone-marrow contribution during adulthood.

These changes triggered significant increases in population sizes and expansions over large distances. Here we investigate the population history of the Fulani, a pastoral population extending throughout the African SahelSavannah belt. Based on genome-wide analyses we propose that ancestors of the Fulani population experienced admixture between a West African group and a group carrying both European and North African ancestries. This admixture was likely coupled with newly adopted herding practices, as it resulted in signatures of genetic adaptation in contemporary Fulani genomes, including the control element of the LCT gene enabling carriers to digest lactose throughout their lives. The lactase persistence (LP) trait in the Fulani is conferred by the presence of the allele T-13910, which is also present at high frequencies in Europe. We establish that the T-13910 LP allele in Fulani individuals analysed in this study lies on a European haplotype background thus excluding parallel convergent evolution. Our findings further suggest that Eurasian admixture and the European LP allele was introduced into the Fulani through contact with a North African populations. We furthermore confirm the link between the lactose digestion phenotype in the Fulani to the MCM6LCT locus by reporting the first Genome Wide Association study (GWAS) of the lactase persistence trait.

The cause of interspecies differences in developmental time remains a mystery partly due to lack of an appropriate model system1. Since murine and human embryos differ in their sizes, geometries, and nutrients, we use in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to compare the same type of cells between the species in similar culture conditions. As an example of well-defined developmental time, we focus on the segmentation clock, oscillatory gene expression that regulates the timing of sequential formation of body segments2–4. In this way we recapitulate the murine and human segmentation clocks in vitro, showing that the species-specific oscillation periods are derived from cell autonomous differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions. Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)-like cells induced from murine and human PSCs displayed the oscillatory expression of HES7, the core gene of the segmentation clock5,6, with oscillation periods of 2-3 hours (mouse PSM) and 5-6 hours (human PSM). Swapping HES7 loci between murine and human genomes did not change the oscillation periods dramatically, denying the possibility that interspecies differences in the sequences of HES7 loci might be the cause of the observed period difference. Instead, we found that the biochemical reactions that determine the oscillation period, such as the degradation of HES7 and delays in its expression, are slower in human PSM compared with those in mouse PSM. With the measured biochemical parameters, our mathematical model successfully accounted for the 2-3-fold period difference between mouse and human. We further demonstrate that the concept of slower biochemical reactions in human cells is generalizable to several other genes, as well as to another cell type. These results collectively indicate that differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions between murine and human cells give rise to the interspecies period difference of the segmentation clock and may contribute to other interspecies differences in developmental time.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Species-specific oscillation periods of human and mouse segmentation clocks are due to cell autonomous differences in biochemical reaction parameters, bioRxiv, 2019-05-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/species-specific_oscillation_periods_of_human_and_mouse_segmentation_clocks_are_due_to_cell_autonomous_differences_in_biochemical_reaction_parameters_61120294/"},{"date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPersonality traits are key indices of inter-individual variation.

In these regions the proportion of phenotypic covariance accounted for by shared genetic effects was between 82 and 100%. Second, in the case of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness, the phenotypic correlation between personality and local brain structure was observed to reflect genetic, more than environmental, factors. These observations indicate that genetic factors influence the relationship between personality traits and local brain structure. Importantly, observed associations between personality traits and cortical thickness did only partially replicate in two independent large-scale samples of unrelated individuals. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that genes impact the relationship between personality and local brain structure, but that phenotypic associations are, to a large extent, non-generalizable. These observations provide a novel perspective on the nature and nurture of the biological basis of personality.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"A shared genetic basis for personality traits and local cortical grey matter structure?, bioRxiv, 2019-05-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_shared_genetic_basis_for_personality_traits_and_local_cortical_grey_matter_structure_61066707/"},{"date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundUnique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) are used in many experiments to find and remove PCR duplicates.

We compared 5,203 bacterial genomes from 1,457 environmental metagenomic samples to test for distinct clouds of diversity, and evaluated metrics that could be used to define the species boundary. Bacterial genomes from the human gut, soil, and the ocean all exhibited gaps in whole-genome average nucleotide identities (ANI) near the previously suggested species threshold of 95% ANI. While genome-wide ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide differences (dNdS) decrease until ANI values approach ∼98%, estimates for homologous recombination approached zero at ∼95% ANI, supporting breakdown of recombination due to sequence divergence as a species-forming force. We evaluated 107 genome-based metrics for their ability to distinguish species when full genomes are not recovered. Full length 16S rRNA genes were least useful because they were under-recovered from metagenomes, but many ribosomal proteins displayed both high metagenomic recoverability and species-discrimination power.

This snapshot approach only provides fragmented information of the underlying genetic makeup of the ECG. Here, we follow the effecs of individual genetic variants through the complete cardiac cycle the ECG represents.

Our results demonstrate how an integrated approach to analyse high-dimensional data can further our understanding of the ECG, adding to the earlier undertaken snapshot analyses of individual ECG components. We anticipate that our comprehensive resource will fuel in silico explorations of the biological mechanisms underlying cardiac traits and disorders represented on the ECG. For example, known disease causing variants can be used to identify novel morphological ECG signatures, which in turn can be utilized to prioritize genetic variants or genes for functional validation.

Many of these interactions are governed by a wide repertoire of chemical signals, and the resulting chemical landscape of the rhizosphere can strongly affect root health and development. To understand how microbe-microbe interactions influence root development in Arabidopsis, we established a model system for plant-microbe-microbe-environment interactions. We inoculated seedlings with a 185-member bacterial synthetic community (SynCom), manipulated the abiotic environment, and measured bacterial colonization of the plant. This enabled classification of the SynCom into four modules of co-occurring strains. We deconstructed the SynCom based on these modules, identifying microbe-microbe interactions that determine root phenotypes. These interactions primarily involve a single bacterial genus, Variovorax, which completely reverts severe root growth inhibition (RGI) induced by a wide diversity of bacterial strains as well as by the entire 185-member community. We demonstrate that Variovorax manipulate plant hormone levels to balance this ecologically realistic root community’s effects on root development. We identify a novel auxin degradation operon in the Variovorax genome that is necessary and sufficient for RGI reversion. Therefore, metabolic signal interference shapes bacteria-plant communication networks and is essential for maintaining the root’s developmental program. Optimizing the feedbacks that shape chemical interaction networks in the rhizosphere provides a promising new ecological strategy towards the development of more resilient and productive crops.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"A single bacterial genus maintains root development in a complex microbiome, bioRxiv, 2019-05-24","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_single_bacterial_genus_maintains_root_development_in_a_complex_microbiome_60956302/"},{"date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe predictive power of polygenic scores for some traits now rivals that of more classical phenotypic measures, and as such they have been promoted as a potential tool for genetically informed policy.

Emergence of phenotypically diverse isolates within CF P. aeruginosa populations has previously been reported, however, the impact of heterogeneity on social behaviors and community function is poorly understood. Here we describe how this heterogeneity impacts on behavioral traits by evolving the strain PAO1 in biofilms grown in a synthetic sputum medium for 50 days. We measured social trait production and antibiotic resistance, and used a metagenomic approach to analyze and assess genomic changes over the duration of the evolution experiment. We found that (i) evolutionary trajectories were reproducible in independently evolving populations; (ii) over 60% of genomic diversity occurred within the first 10 days of selection. We then focused on quorum sensing (QS), a well-studied P. aeruginosa trait that is commonly mutated in strains isolated from CF lungs. We found that at the population level (i) evolution in sputum medium selected for decreased production of QS and QS-dependent traits; (ii) there was a significant correlation between lasR mutant frequency, the loss of protease and the 3O-C12-HSL signal, and an increase in resistance to clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics, despite no previous antibiotic exposure. Overall, our findings provide insights into the impact of allelic polymorphism on community functions in diverse P. aeruginosa populations.

We found that Sox6 represents a novel, defining marker for GPe neuron subtypes. Lhx6+ neurons that lack the expression of Sox6 were devoid of both parvalbumin and Npas1. This result confirms previous assertions of the existence of a unique Lhx6+ population. Neurons that arise from the Dbx1+ lineage were similarly abundant in the GPe and displayed a heterogeneous makeup. Importantly, tracing experiments revealed that Npas1+-Nkx2.1+ neurons represent the principal non-cholinergic, cortically-projecting neurons.

Their characteristics of delayed onset of age-related diseases and compression of morbidity imply that their immune system remains functional. Here we performed single-cell transcriptome analysis of 61,202 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), derived from seven supercentenarians and five younger controls. We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells (CD4 CTLs) coupled with a substantial reduction of B-cells as a novel signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing of two supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15% to 35% of the entire CD4 T-cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs. This indicates that CD4 CTLs utilize the transcriptional program of the CD8 lineage while retaining CD4 expression. Our study reveals that supercentenarians have unique characteristics in their circulating lymphocytes, which may represent an essential adaptation to achieve exceptional longevity by sustaining immune responses to infections and diseases.SignificanceExceptionally long-lived people such as supercentenarians tend to spend their entire lives in good health, implying that their immune system remains active to protect against infections and tumors. However, their immunological condition has been largely unexplored. We profiled thousands of circulating immune cells from supercentenarians at single-cell resolution, and identified a large number of CD4 T-cells that have cytotoxic features. This characteristic is very unique to supercentenarians, because generally CD4 T-cells have helper, but not cytotoxic, functions under physiological conditions. We further profiled their T-cell receptors, and revealed that the cytotoxic CD4 T-cells were accumulated through clonal expansion. The conversion of helper CD4 T-cells to a cytotoxic variety might be an adaptation to the late stage of aging.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Single-cell transcriptomics reveals expansion of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells in supercentenarians, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/single-cell_transcriptomics_reveals_expansion_of_cytotoxic_cd4_t-cells_in_supercentenarians_60713002/"},{"date":"2019-05-20T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractNeuronal inactivation is commonly used to assess the involvement of groups of neurons in specific brain functions. Optogenetic tools allow manipulations of genetically and spatially defined neuronal populations with excellent temporal resolution. However, the targeted neurons are coupled with other neural populations over multiple length scales. As a result, the effects of localized optogenetic manipulations are not limited to the targeted neurons, but produces spatially extended excitation and inhibition with rich dynamics. Here we benchmarked several optogenetic silencers in transgenic mice and with viral gene transduction, with the goal to inactivate excitatory neurons in small regions of neocortex. We analyzed the effects of the perturbations in vivo using electrophysiology. Channelrhodopsin activation of GABAergic neurons produced more effective photoinhibition of pyramidal neurons than direct photoinhibition using light-gated ion pumps. We made transgenic mice expressing the light-dependent chloride channel GtACR under the control of Cre-recombinase. Activation of GtACR produced the most potent photoinhibition. For all methods, localized photostimuli produced photoinhibition that extended substantially beyond the spread of light in tissue, although different methods had slightly different resolution limits (radius of inactivation, 0.5 mm to 1 mm). The spatial profile of photoinhibition was likely shaped by strong coupling between cortical neurons. Over some range of photostimulation, circuits produced the “paradoxical effect”, where excitation of inhibitory neurons reduced activity in these neurons, together with pyramidal neurons, a signature of inhibition-stabilized neural networks. The offset of optogenetic inactivation was followed by rebound excitation in a light dose-dependent manner, which can be mitigated by slowly varying photostimuli, but at the expense of time resolution. Our data offer guidance for the design of in vivo optogenetics experiments and suggest how these experiments can reveal operating principles of neural circuits.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Spatiotemporal limits of optogenetic manipulations in cortical circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/spatiotemporal_limits_of_optogenetic_manipulations_in_cortical_circuits_60710064/"},{"date":"2019-05-18T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSpecialized epitope tags are widely used for detecting, manipulating or purifying proteins, but often their versatility is limited.

However, results have been largely inconsistent across studies, and there is therefore a pressing need to determine the primary factors influencing replicability. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange to investigate two potential factors denoising strategy and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition, etc.). We examined the similarity of both group-average functional connectomes and group-level differences (ASD vs. control) across 33 denoising pipelines and four independently-acquired datasets. The group-average connectomes were highly consistent across pipelines (r = 0.92±0.06) and sites (r = 0.88±0.02). However, the group differences, while still consistent within site across pipelines (r = 0.76±0.12), were highly inconsistent across sites regardless of choice of denoising strategies (r = 0.07±0.04), suggesting lack of replication may be strongly influenced by site andor cohort differences. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at a large-scale network level or when considering only the most significant edges. We further show through an extensive literature survey that the parameters chosen in the current study (i.e., sample size, age range, preprocessing methods) are quite representative of the published literature.

Here we simulate secondary contact between two populations (‘species’) to examine effects of pre- and postzygotic isolation in preventing blending. A small reduction in hybrid fitness (e.g., 10%) produces a narrower hybrid zone than a strong but imperfect mating preference (e.g., 10x stronger preference for conspecific over heterospecific mates). This is because, in the latter case, rare F1 hybrids find each other attractive (due to assortative mating), leading to the gradual buildup of a full continuum of intermediates between the two species. The cline is narrower than would result from purely neutral diffusion over the same number of generations, but this effect is due to the frequency-dependent mating disadvantage of individuals of rare mating types. Hybrids tend to pay this cost of rarity more than pure individuals, meaning there is an induced postzygotic isolation effect of assortative mating. When this induced mating disadvantage is removed, partial assortative mating does not prevent eventual blending of the species. These results prompt a questioning of the concept of partial prezygotic isolation, since it is not very isolating unless there is also postzygotic isolation.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Assortative mating in hybrid zones is remarkably ineffective in promoting speciation, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/assortative_mating_in_hybrid_zones_is_remarkably_ineffective_in_promoting_speciation_60565197/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now been conducted for hundreds of phenotypes of relevance to human health. Many such GWAS involve multiple closely-related phenotypes collected on the same samples. However, the vast majority of these GWAS have been analyzed using simple univariate analyses, which consider one phenotype at a time. This is de-spite the fact that, at least in simulation experiments, multivariate analyses have been shown to be more powerful at detecting associations. Here, we conduct multivariate association analyses on 13 different publicly-available GWAS datasets that involve multiple closely-related phenotypes. These data include large studies of anthropometric traits (GIANT), plasma lipid traits (GlobalLipids), and red blood cell traits (HaemgenRBC). Our analyses identify many new associations (433 in total across the 13 studies), many of which replicate when follow-up samples are available. Overall, our results demonstrate that multivariate analyses can help make more effective use of data from both existing and future GWAS.1Author SummaryGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a common and powerful tool for identifying significant correlations between markers of genetic variation and physical traits of interest. Often these studies are conducted by comparing genetic variation against single traits one at a time (‘univariate’); however, it has previously been shown that it is possible to increase your power to detect significant associations by comparing genetic variation against multiple traits simultaneously (‘multivariate’). Despite this apparent increase in power though, researchers still rarely conduct multivariate GWAS, even when studies have multiple traits readily available. Here, we reanalyze 13 previously published GWAS using a multivariate method and find \u0026gt;400 additional associations. Our method makes use of univariate GWAS summary statistics and is available as a software package, thus making it accessible to other researchers interested in conducting the same analyses. We also show, using studies that have multiple releases, that our new associations have high rates of replication. Overall, we argue multivariate approaches in GWAS should no longer be overlooked and how, often, there is low-hanging fruit in the form of new associations by running these methods on data already collected.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Bayesian multivariate reanalysis of large genetic studies identifies many new associations, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/bayesian_multivariate_reanalysis_of_large_genetic_studies_identifies_many_new_associations_60573413/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Dogs were the first domesticated animal and, according to the archaeological evidence, have had a close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years.

A dog in the family during childhood is associated with ownership in adult life. The underlying factors behind this association could be related to experiences or to genetic influences. We aimed to investigate the heritability of dog ownership in a large twin sample including all twins in the Swedish Twin Registry born between 1926 and 1996 and alive in 2006. Information about dog ownership was available from 2001 to 2016 from national dog registers. The final data set included 85,542 twins from 50,507 twin pairs with known zygosity, where information on both twins were available in 35,035 pairs. Structural equation modeling was performed to estimate additive genetic effects (the heritability), commonshared environmental, and uniquenon-shared environmental effects. We found that additive genetic factors largely contributed to dog ownership, with heritability estimated at 57% for females and 51% for males. An effect of shared environmental factors was only observed in early adulthood. In conclusion, we show a strong genetic contribution to dog ownership in adulthood in a large twin study. We see two main implications of this finding (1) genetic variation may have contributed to our ability to domesticate dogs and other animals and (2) potential pleiotropic effects of genetic variation affecting dog ownership should be considered in studies examining health impacts of dog ownership.","tags":["scientific reports","genetics","500+-users","2019"],"title":"Evidence of large genetic influences on dog ownership in the Swedish Twin Registry has implications for understanding domestication and health associations, Scientific Reports, 2019-05-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/evidence_of_large_genetic_influences_on_dog_ownership_in_the_swedish_twin_registry_has_implications_for_understanding_domestication_and_health_associations_60582021/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYBreast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where each OncoOmics approach needs to be fully understood as a part of a complex network.

In virtually all environments studied, a few highly abundant taxa dominate the structure of microbial communities. Still, microbial diversity is high and is concentrated in the less abundant, or rare, fractions of the community, i.e. the “long tail” of the abundance distribution. The relationship between microbial community structure and activity, specifically the role of rare microbes, and its connection to ecosystem function, is not fully understood. We analyzed 12.3 million metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence assemblies and their genes from environmental, human, and engineered microbiomes, and show that microbial activity is dominated by rare microbes (96% of total activity) across all measured biomes. Further, rare microbial activity was comprised of traits that are fundamental to ecosystem and organismal health, e.g. biogeochemical cycling and infectious disease. The activity of rare microbes was also tightly coupled to temperature, revealing a link between basic biological processes, e.g. reaction rates, and community activity.

However, traditional methods for knock-in require laborious cloning of long homology arms for homology-directed repair. Here, we report a simplified method in Drosophila melanogaster to insert large DNA elements into any gene using homology-independent repair. This method, known as CRISPaint, employs CRISPR-Cas9 and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to linearize and insert donor plasmid DNA into a target genomic cut site. The inclusion of commonly used elements such as GFP on donor plasmids makes them universal, abolishing the need to create gene-specific homology arms and greatly reducing user workload. Using this method, we show robust gene-specific integration of donor plasmids in cultured cells and the fly germ line. Furthermore, we use this method to analyze gene function by fluorescently tagging endogenous proteins, disrupting gene function, and generating reporters of gene expression. Finally, we assemble a collection of donor plasmids for germ line knock-in that contain commonly used insert sequences. This method simplifies the generation of site-specific large DNA insertions in Drosophila cell lines and fly strains, and better enables researchers to dissect gene function in vivo.SummaryWe report a new homology-independent genomic knock-in method in Drosophila to insert large DNA elements into any target gene.

Most transdiagnostic studies have derived factors based only on clinical symptoms, which might miss possible links between psychopathology, cognitive processes and personality traits. Furthermore, many psychiatric studies focus on higher-order association brain networks, thus neglecting the potential influence of huge swaths of the brain.MethodsA multivariate data-driven approach (partial least squares; PLS) was utilized to identify latent components linking a large set of clinical, cognitive and personality measures to whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns across 224 participants. The participants were either healthy (N=110) or diagnosed with bipolar disorder (N=40), attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (N=37), schizophrenia (N=29) or schizoaffective disorder (N=8). In contrast to traditional case-control analyses, the diagnostic categories were not utilized in the PLS analysis, but were helpful for interpreting the components.ResultsOur analyses revealed three latent components corresponding to general psychopathology, cognitive dysfunction and impulsivity. Each component was associated with a unique whole-brain RSFC signature and shared across all participants. The components were robust across multiple control analyses and replicated using independent task functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the same participants. Strikingly, all three components featured connectivity alterations within the somatosensory-motor network, and its connectivity with subcortical structures and cortical executive networks.ConclusionsWe identified three distinct dimensions with dissociable (but overlapping) whole-brain RSFC signatures across healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric illness, providing potential intermediate phenotypes that span across diagnostic categories. Our results suggest expanding the focus of psychiatric neuroscience beyond higher-order brain networks.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Somatosensory-Motor Dysconnectivity Spans Multiple Transdiagnostic Dimensions of Psychopathology, bioRxiv, 2019-05-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/somatosensory-motor_dysconnectivity_spans_multiple_transdiagnostic_dimensions_of_psychopathology_60512649/"},{"date":"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe ClpXP machinery is a two component protease complex performing targeted protein degradation in bacteria and eukaryotes.

Formation of the complex involves a symmetry mismatch, since hexameric AAA+ rings bind axially to the opposing stacked heptameric rings of the tetradecameric ClpP. Here we present the first high-resolution cryo-EM structure of ClpXP from Listeria monocytogenes.

We first measured activity in a region that receives retinal projections9, the superficial superior colliculus (sSC), and found that this activity strongly depended on behavioural state. This modulation was not mediated by feedback inputs from V1 as it was immune to V1 inactivation. We then used Neuropixels probes10 to record activity in the optic tract, and we found some retinal axons whose activity significantly varied with arousal, even in darkness.

Using chemogenetics and microdialysis, we show that, in sign-trackers, stimulation of the neuronal pathway from the prelimbic cortex (PrL) to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) decreases the incentive value of a reward-cue.

The library consists currently of more than 2600 plasmids and 1400 fly lines with a focus on targeting kinases, phosphatases and transcription factors, each expressing two sgRNAs under control of the Gal4UAS system. We show that conditional CRISPR mutagenesis is robust across many target genes and can be efficiently employed in various somatic tissues, as well as the germline. In order to prevent artefacts commonly associated with excessive amounts of Cas9 protein, we have developed a series of novel UAS-Cas9 transgenes, which allow fine tuning of Cas9 expression to achieve high gene editing activity without detectable toxicity. Functional assays, as well as direct sequencing of genomic sgRNA target sites, indicates that the vast majority of transgenic sgRNA lines mediate efficient gene disruption.

Sequencing below this threshold will reduce statistical power while sequencing above will provide only marginal improvements in power and incur unnecessary sequencing costs. Although existing methodologies can help assess whether there is sufficient read depth, they are unable to guide how many additional reads should be sequenced to reach this threshold. We provide a new method called superSeq that models the relationship between statistical power and read depth. We apply the superSeq framework to 393 RNA-Seq experiments (1,021 total contrasts) in the Expression Atlas and find the model accurately predicts the increase in statistical power gained by increasing the read depth. Based on our analysis, we find that most published studies (\u0026gt; 70%) are undersequenced, i.e., their statistical power can be improved by increasing the sequencing read depth. In addition, the extent of saturation is highly dependent on statistical methodology only 9.5%, 29.5%, and 26.6% of contrasts are saturated when using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma, respectively. Finally, we also find that there is no clear minimum per-transcript read depth to guarantee saturation for an entire technology. Therefore, our framework not only delineates key differences among methods and their impact on determining saturation, but will also be needed even as technology improves and the read depth of experiments increases. Researchers can thus use superSeq to calculate the read depth to achieve required statistical power while avoiding unnecessary sequencing costs.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Determining sufficient sequencing depth in RNA-Seq differential expression studies, bioRxiv, 2019-05-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/determining_sufficient_sequencing_depth_in_rna-seq_differential_expression_studies_60401132/"},{"date":"2019-05-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSequence logos are visually compelling ways of illustrating the biological properties of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, yet it is currently difficult to generate such logos within the Python programming environment.

Moreover, much is unknown regarding the nature, spread and persistence of DNA shed by animals into terrestrial environments, or the optimal experimental design for understanding these potential biases.To address some of these challenges, we compared the detection of terrestrial mammals using eDNA analysis of soil samples against confirmed species observations from a long-term (∼9-yr) camera trapping study. At the same time, we considered multiple experimental parameters, including two sampling designs, two DNA extraction kits and two metabarcodes of different sizes.All mammals consistently recorded with cameras were detected in eDNA. In addition, eDNA reported many small mammals not recorded by camera traps, but whose presence in the study area is otherwise documented. A long metabarcode (≈220bp) offering a high taxonomic resolution, achieved a similar efficiency as a shorter one (≈70bp) and a phosphate buffer-based extraction gave similar results as a total DNA extraction method for a fraction of the price.

Stress is a major factor inducing TE activity, however the regulatory mechanisms underlying de-repression are poorly understood. Key unresolved questions are whether different types of stress differentially induce TE activity and whether different TEs respond differently to the same stress. Plant pathogens are excellent models to dissect the impact of stress on TEs, because lifestyle transitions on and off the host impose exposure to a variety of stress conditions. We analyzed the TE expression landscape of four well-characterized strains of the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We experimentally exposed strains to nutrient starvation and host infection stress. Contrary to expectations, we show that the two distinct conditions induce the expression of different sets of TEs. In particular, the most highly expressed TEs, including MITE and LTR-Gypsy elements, show highly distinct de-repression across stress conditions. Both the genomic context of TEs and the genetic background stress (i.e. different strains harboring the same TEs) were major predictors of de-repression dynamics under stress. Genomic defenses inducing point mutations in repetitive regions were largely ineffective to prevent TE de-repression. Consistent with TE de-repression being governed by epigenetic effects, we found that gene expression profiles under stress varied significantly depending on the proximity to the closest TEs. The unexpected complexity in TE responsiveness to stress across genetic backgrounds and genomic locations shows that species harbor substantial genetic variation to control TEs.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Stress-driven transposable element de-repression dynamics in a fungal pathogen, bioRxiv, 2019-05-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/stress-driven_transposable_element_de-repression_dynamics_in_a_fungal_pathogen_60230982/"},{"date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTA multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts.

Our approach opens up two possibilities a) formal investigations can involve photographic stimuli as opposed to stimuli handcrafted and coded by the experimenter; b) model comparison can determine which level of representation within a DCNN a learner is using during categorization decisions. Pursuing the latter point, DCNNs suggest that the shape bias in children relies on representations at more advanced network layers whereas a learner that relied on lower network layers would display a color bias. These results confirm the role of natural statistics in the shape bias (i.e., shape is predictive of category membership) while highlighting that the type of statistics matter, i.e., those from lower or higher levels of representation. We use the same approach to provide evidence that pigeons performing seemingly sophisticated categorization of complex imagery may in fact be relying on representations that are very low-level (i.e., retinotopic).

These short regions contain limited phylogenetic signal, which makes it impractical to use environmental DNA in full phylogenetic inferences. However, new long-read sequencing technologies such as the Pacific Biosciences platform may provide sufficiently large sequence lengths to overcome the poor phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain a ~4500 bp region of the eukaryotic rDNA operon spanning most of the small (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA genes. The CCS reads were first treated with a novel curation workflow that generated 650 high-quality OTUs containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions of the long amplicons. In order to assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based and phylogenetic placement-based methods using shorter reads. The taxonomically-annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58%) corresponded to the new long environmental CCS reads. Comparisons to the 18S-only region of our amplicons revealed that the combined 18S-28S genes globally increased the phylogenetic resolution, recovering specific groupings otherwise missing. The long-reads also allowed to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny.

Here, we use theory, simulations, and real data to evaluate the potential gain of PS-based embryo selection, defined as the expected difference in trait value between the top-scoring embryo and an average, unselected embryo. We observe that the gain increases very slowly with the number of embryos, but more rapidly with increased variance explained by the PS. Given currently available polygenic predictors and typical IVF yields, the average gain due to selection would be ≈2.5cm if selecting for height, and ≈2.5 IQ (intelligence quotient) points if selecting for cognitive function. These mean values are accompanied by wide confidence intervals; in real data drawn from nuclear families with up to 20 offspring each, we observe that the offspring with the highest PS for height was the tallest only in 25% of the families.

This allowed us to establish new molecular definitions of the patch-matrix compartments, resulting in a molecular code for mapping patch SPNs at the cellular level. In addition, Oprm1 expression labeled exopatch SPNs, which we found to be molecularly distinct from both patch as well as neighboring matrix SPNs, thereby forming a separate molecular entity. At the cell-type level, we found an unexpected SPN diversity, leading to the identification of a new Col11a1+ striatonigral SPN type. At the tissue level, we found that mapping the spatial expression of a number of markers revealed new definitions of spatial domains in the striatum, which were conserved in the non-human primate brain. Interestingly, the spatial markers were cell-type independent and instead represented a spatial code that was found across all SPNs within a spatially restricted domain.

To study variation in meiotic outcomes within and across individuals, we developed a way to sequence many individual sperm genomes at once. We used this method to sequence the genomes of 31,228 gametes from 20 sperm donors, identifying 813,122 crossovers, 787 aneuploid chromosomes, and unexpected genomic anomalies. Different sperm donors varied four-fold in the frequency of aneuploid sperm, and aneuploid chromosomes gained in meiosis I had 36% fewer crossovers than corresponding non-aneuploid chromosomes. Diverse recombination phenotypes were surprisingly coordinated donors with high average crossover rates also made a larger fraction of their crossovers in centromere-proximal regions and placed their crossovers closer together. These same relationships were also evident in the variation among individual gametes from the same donor sperm with more crossovers tended to have made crossovers closer together and in centromere-proximal regions. Variation in the physical compaction of chromosomes could help explain this coordination of meiotic variation across chromosomes, gametes, and individuals.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Insights about variation in meiosis from 31,228 human sperm genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-05-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/insights_about_variation_in_meiosis_from_31228_human_sperm_genomes_59828087/"},{"date":"2019-05-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMicroglia are specialized brain-resident macrophages with important functions in health and disease. To improve our understanding of these cells, the research community needs genetic tools to identify and control them in a manner that distinguishes them from closely related cell-types. We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific Tmem119 gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous Tmem119 in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b+CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 primarily in microglia upon tamoxifen administration with the caveat of activity in leptomeningeal cells. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the Tmem119-EGFP and Tmem119-CreERT2 lines, respectively.

Here we propose a memory model of the hippocampus that provides a novel interpretation of place cells consistent with these observations. We hypothesize that the hippocampus is a memory device that takes advantage of the correlations between sensory experiences to generate compressed representations of the episodes that are stored in memory. A simple neural network model that can efficiently compress information naturally produces place cells that are similar to those observed in experiments. It predicts that the activity of these cells is variable and that the fluctuations of the place fields encode information about the recent history of sensory experiences.

The learned representation space organizes sequences at multiple levels of biological granularity from the biochemical to proteomic levels. Unsupervised learning recovers information about protein structure secondary structure and residue-residue contacts can be identified by linear projections from the learned representations. Training language models on full sequence diversity rather than individual protein families increases recoverable information about secondary structure. The unsupervised models can be adapted with supervision from quantitative mutagenesis data to predict variant activity.

The impact of high Lp(a) levels on human longevity is however controversial. Our objectives were to determine whether genetically-determined Lp(a) levels are associated with parental lifespan and to assess the association between measured and genetically-determined Lp(a) levels and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.MethodsWe determined the association between a genetic risk score of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms weighted for their impact on Lp(a) levels (wGRS) and parental lifespan (at least one long-lived parent; father still alive and older than 90 or father’s age of death ≥90 or mother still alive and older than 93 or mother’s age of death ≥93) in 139,362 participants from the UK Biobank. A total of 17,686 participants were considered as having high parental lifespan. We also investigated the association between Lp(a) levels and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in 18,720 participants from the EPIC-Norfolk study.ResultsIn the UK Biobank, increases in the wGRS (weighted for a 50 mgdL increase in Lp(a) levels) were inversely associated with a high parental lifespan (odds ratio=0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.89-0.94, p=2.7×10−8). During the 20-year follow-up of the EPIC-Norfolk study, 5686 participants died (2412 from CVD-related causes). Compared to participants with Lp(a) levels \u0026lt;50 mgdL, those with Lp(a) levels ≥50 mgdL had an increased hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause (HR=1.17, 95% CI=1.08-1.27) and cardiovascular (HR=1.54, 95% CI=1.37-1.72) mortality. Compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels below the 50th percentile of the Lp(a) distribution (in whom event rates were 29.8% and 11.3%, respectively for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality), those with Lp(a) levels equal or above the 95th percentile of the population distribution (≥70 mgdL) had HRs of 1.22 (95% CI=1.09-1.37, event rate 37.5%) and 1.71 (95% CI=1.46-2.00, event rate 20.0%), for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively.ConclusionsResults of this study suggest a potentially causal effect of Lp(a) on human longevity, support the use of parental lifespan as a tool to study the genetic determinants of human longevity, and provide a rationale for a trial of Lp(a)-lowering therapy in individuals with high Lp(a) levels.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Long-Term Exposure to Elevated Lipoprotein(a) Levels, Parental Lifespan and Risk of Mortality, bioRxiv, 2019-04-30","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/long-term_exposure_to_elevated_lipoproteina_levels_parental_lifespan_and_risk_of_mortality_59696840/"},{"date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIn humans, the 813 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for transducing diverse chemical stimuli to alter cell state, and are the largest class of drug targets.

Here we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G-protein signal transduction. We tested 7,800 of 7,828 possible single amino acid substitutions to the beta-2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) at four concentrations of the agonist isoproterenol. We identified residues specifically important for β2AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor. More broadly, by linking deep mutational scanning with engineered transcriptional reporters, we establish a generalizable method for exploring pharmacogenomics, structure and function across broad classes of drug receptors.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Structural and Functional Characterization of G Protein-Coupled Receptors with Deep Mutational Scanning, bioRxiv, 2019-04-30","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/structural_and_functional_characterization_of_g_protein-coupled_receptors_with_deep_mutational_scanning_59714625/"},{"date":"2019-04-29T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractModern recording techniques enable large-scale measurements of neural activity in a variety of model organisms.

We incorporate these models into a hierarchical framework that combines partial recordings from many worms to learn shared structure, while still allowing for individual variability. This framework reveals latent states of population neural activity, along with the discrete behavioral states that govern dynamics in this state space. We find stochastic transition patterns between discrete states and see that transition probabilities are determined by both current brain activity and sensory cues.

First, we evaluated 1,952 publications in the peer-reviewed literature generated by exhaustive search terms that combined synonyms of “early career researcher” and “peer review” and found no previous studies about ECRs ghostwriting peer review reports. We then surveyed 498 researchers about their experiences with, and opinions about, co-reviewing and ghostwriting as ECRs. Three quarters of those surveyed have co-reviewed and most find it to be a beneficial (95% agree) and ethical (73% agree) form of training in peer review. Co-reviewing is the second most commonly reported form of training in peer review besides receiving reviews on one’s own papers. Half of survey respondents have ghostwritten a peer review report, despite the 45ths majority opinion that ghostwriting is unethical. Survey respondents report that the three major barriers to including co-reviewer names on peer review reports are a lack of communication between PIs and ECRs; a false belief that co-authorship is for manuscripts but not peer review reports; and prohibitive journal policies that are out of alignment with current practice and opinions about best practice.

Competent bacteria are able to absorb free DNA from their surroundings and exchange this DNA against pieces of their own genome when sufficiently homologous. And while it is known that transformation contributes to evolution and pathogen emergence in bacteria, there are still questions regarding the general prevalence of non-degraded DNA with sufficient coding capacity. In this context, we previously showed that the naturally competent bacterium Vibrio cholerae uses its type VI secretion system (T6SS) to actively acquire DNA from non-kin neighbors under chitin-colonizing conditions. We therefore sought to further explore the role of the T6SS in acquiring DNA, the condition of the DNA released through T6SS-mediated killing versus passive cell lysis, and the extent of the transfers that occur due to these conditions. To do this, we herein measured the frequency and the extent of genetic exchanges in bacterial co-cultures on competence-inducing chitin under various DNA-acquisition conditions. We show that competent V. cholerae strains acquire DNA fragments with an average and maximum length exceeding 50 kbp and 150 kbp, respectively, and that the T6SS is of prime importance for such HGT events. Collectively, our data support the notion that the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae fosters HGT and that the coding capacity of the exchanged genetic material is sufficient to significantly accelerate bacterial evolution.Significance StatementDNA shuffled from one organism to another in an inheritable manner is a common feature of prokaryotes. It is a significant mechanism by which bacteria acquire new phenotypes, for example by first absorbing foreign DNA and then recombining it into their genome. In this study, we show the remarkable extent of the exchanged genetic material, frequently exceeding 150 genes in a seemingly single transfer event, in Vibrio cholerae. We also show that to best preserve its length and quality, bacteria mainly acquire this DNA by killing adjacent, healthy neighbors then immediately absorbing the released DNA before it can be degraded. These new insights into this prey-killing DNA acquisition process shed light on how bacterial species evolve in the wild.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Neighbor predation linked to natural competence fosters the transfer of large genomic regions in Vibrio cholerae, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/neighbor_predation_linked_to_natural_competence_fosters_the_transfer_of_large_genomic_regions_in_vibrio_cholerae_59471825/"},{"date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractLong arrays of simple, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (known as satellites) are enriched in centromeres1 and pericentromeric regions2, and contribute to chromosome segregation and other heterochromatin functions3,4.

Satellite transcription andor RNAs may also promote centromere and heterochromatin activities 8-12. However, we lack direct evidence that satellite DNA transcripts are required for normal cell or organismal functions. Here, we show that satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cell types throughout Drosophila melanogaster development, enriched in neuronal tissues and testes, localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find that AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility and are specifically required for normal histone-protamine exchange and sperm chromatin organization. Since AAGAG RNA-dependent events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA functions in primary spermatocytes to ‘prime’ post-meiosis steps in sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating specific essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related Drosophila species suggest that satellite repeats and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"RNA transcribed from heterochromatic simple-tandem repeats are required for male fertility and histone-protamine exchange in Drosophila melanogaster, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rna_transcribed_from_heterochromatic_simple-tandem_repeats_are_required_for_male_fertility_and_histone-protamine_exchange_in_drosophila_melanogaster_59473338/"},{"date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTThe gut microbiota influences the development and homeostasis of the mammalian immune system1–3, can alter immune cell compositions in mice4–7, and is associated with responses to immunotherapy that rely on the activity of peripheral immune cells8–12.

Here we overcome this challenge by studying hundreds of hospitalized—and closely monitored—bone marrow transplantation patients as they recover from chemotherapy-induced immune ablation. This aggressive treatment causes large shifts in both circulatory immune cell and microbiota populations, allowing the relationships between the two to be studied simultaneously over time with unprecedented resolution. We analyzed daily changes in white blood cell counts from 2,235 patients, and 10,680 longitudinal fecal microbiota samples to identify bacterial genera consistently associated with those changes. Bayesian inference and validation across different patient cohorts revealed consistent associations between intestinal bacteria and peripheral immune cell dynamics in the context of immunomodulatory medications, clinical metadata and homeostatic feedbacks between peripheral immune cells. The quantification of validated microbiota associations enabled us to contrast the potency of fermentatively active, obligate anaerobic bacteria with that of medications with known immunomodulatory mechanism, and this way estimate the microbiota potential to alter peripheral immune cell dynamics directly in patients.

Comparisons of splice site combinations between these three kingdoms revealed several differences such as a substantially increased CT-AC frequency in fungal genomes.

The current study using a transient exposure of gestating F0 generation female rats found negligible impacts of glyphosate on the directly exposed F0 generation, or F1 generation offspring pathology. In contrast, dramatic increases in pathologies in the F2 generation grand-offspring, and F3 transgenerational great-grand-offspring were observed.

Two contrasting hypotheses have been put forward to explain how species interactions could influence diversification. ‘Ecological Controls’ (EC) predicts a negative diversity-diversification relationship, where the evolution of novel types becomes constrained as available niches become filled5. In contrast, ‘Diversity Begets Diversity’ (DBD) predicts a positive relationship, with diversity promoting diversification via niche construction and other species interactions6. Using the Earth Microbiome Project, the largest standardized survey of global biodiversity to date7, we provide support for DBD as the dominant driver of microbiome diversity. Only in the most diverse microbiomes does DBD reach a plateau, consistent with increasingly saturated niche space. Genera that are strongly associated with a particular biome show a stronger DBD relationship than non-residents, consistent with prolonged evolutionary interactions driving diversification. Genera with larger genomes also experience a stronger DBD response, which could be due to a higher potential for metabolic interactions and niche construction offered by more diverse gene repertoires. Our results demonstrate that the rate at which microbiomes accumulate diversity is crucially dependent on resident diversity. This fits a scenario in which species interactions are important drivers of microbiome diversity.

This can provide insights into how multiple regulatory elements cooperate or compete for transcriptional activation. We have used these techniques in a mouse model in which the α-globin domain is extended to include several additional genes. This allows us to determine how the interactions of the α-globin super-enhancer are distributed between multiple promoters in a single domain. Our data show that gene promoters do not form mutually exclusive interactions with the super-enhancer, but all interact simultaneously in a single complex.

GWAS have by design focused on common DNA sequence variants; however, recent studies underscore the likely importance of the contribution of rare variants to heritable variation2. Further, finding the genes that underlie the GWAS signals remains a major challenge. Here, we use a unique model system to disentangle the contributions of common and rare variants to a large number of quantitative traits. We generated large crosses among 16 diverse yeast strains and identified thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that explain most of the heritable variation in 38 traits. We combined our results with sequencing data for 1,011 yeast isolates3 to decouple variant effect size estimation from allele frequency and showed that rare variants make a disproportionate contribution to trait variation as a consequence of their larger effect sizes. Evolutionary analyses revealed that this contribution is driven by rare variants that arose recently, that such variants are more likely to decrease fitness, and that negative selection has shaped the relationship between variant frequency and effect size. Finally, we leveraged the structure of the crosses to resolve hundreds of QTLs to single genes.

One can obtain a degree of specificity with neuron-specific promoters, but native promoters are almost never sufficiently specific restricting this approach to transgenic animals. We recently showed that one can obtain transgenic mice with augmented anatomical specificity in targeted brain regions by identifying cis-regulatory elements (i.e. enhancers) uniquely active in those brain regions and combining them with a heterologous promoter, an approach we call EDGE (Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression). Here we extend this strategy to the generation of viral (rAAV) vectors, showing that when combined with the right minimal promoter they largely recapitulate the specificity seen in the corresponding transgenic lines in wildtype animals, even of another species. Because active enhancers can be identified in any tissue sample, this approach promises to enable the kind of circuit-specific manipulations in any species.

Together, this provides a low-cost method that can be applied even in low resource settings to directly examine cellular DNA. This technique has extensive clinical applications for assessing medically relevant genes and has the versatility to be a rapid and comprehensive diagnostic tool. We demonstrate applications of this technique by examining the well-characterized GM12878 cell line as well as three breast cell lines (MCF-10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) with varying tumorigenic potential as a model for cancer.ContributionsTG and WT constructed the study.

Similar to how a reference genome sequence revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we present the first human “all-by-all” binary reference interactome map, or “HuRI”. With ~53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"A reference map of the human protein interactome, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_reference_map_of_the_human_protein_interactome_58852789/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMost bacteria in nature exist in aggregated communities known as biofilms. Bacteria within biofilms are inherently highly resistant to antibiotics. Current understanding of the evolution and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is largely derived from work from cells in liquid culture and it is unclear whether biofilms adapt and evolve in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of drugs. Here we used a biofilm evolution model to show that biofilms of a model food borne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium rapidly evolve in response to exposure to three clinically important antibiotics. Whilst the model strongly selected for improved biofilm formation in the absence of any drug, once antibiotics were introduced the need to adapt to the drug was more important than the selection for improved biofilm formation. Adaptation to antibiotic stress imposed a marked cost in biofilm formation, particularly evident for populations exposed to cefotaxime and azithromycin. We identified distinct resistance phenotypes in biofilms compared to corresponding planktonic control cultures and characterised new mechanisms of resistance to cefotaxime and azithromycin. Novel substitutions within the multidrug efflux transporter, AcrB were identified and validated as impacting drug export as well as changes in regulators of this efflux system. There were clear fitness costs identified and associated with different evolutionary trajectories. Our results demonstrate that biofilms adapt rapidly to low concentrations of antibiotics and the mechanisms of adaptation are novel. This work will be a starting point for studies to further examine biofilm specific pathways of adaptation which inform future antibiotic use.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Antibiotics select for novel pathways of resistance in biofilms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/antibiotics_select_for_novel_pathways_of_resistance_in_biofilms_58836429/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight life outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modelling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide novel insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Comparing within- and between-family polygenic score prediction, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/comparing_within-_and_between-family_polygenic_score_prediction_58836801/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSummarychromoMap is an R package for constructing interactive visualizations of chromosomeschromosomal regions, and mapping of chromosomal elements (like genes) onto them, of any living organism.

Here, we introduce a formal model of cardiac active inference, which explains how ascending cardiac signals entrain exteroceptive sensory perception and confidence. Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to fear perception. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt fear expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate metacognitive biases.

We conducted genome-wide association analyses of lifetime symptoms of mania, psychosis, irritability in 124,952 to 208,315 individuals from UK Biobank, and then applied Genomic SEM to model the genetic relationships between these psychiatric symptoms and clinically-defined psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder). Two dimensions of cross-cutting genetic liability emerged general vulnerability to self-reported symptoms (pself) versus transdiagnostic vulnerability to clinically-diagnosed disease (pclinician). These were only modestly correlated (rg= .344). Multivariate GWAS identified 145 and 11 independent and genome-wide significant loci forpclinicianandpself, respectively, and improved polygenic prediction, relative to univariate GWAS, in hold-out samples.

Genetic variance inpclinicianthat was unrelated to general vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms was associated withlesssocioeconomic disadvantage, suggesting positive selection biases in clinical samples used in psychiatric GWAS.

Application of nano-ID to the heat shock response in human cells reveals that many RNA isoforms change their synthesis rate, stability, and splicing pattern. nano-ID also shows that the metabolism of individual RNA isoforms differs strongly from that estimated for the combined RNA signal at a specific gene locus. And although combined RNA stability correlates with poly(A)-tail length, individual RNA isoforms can deviate significantly. nano-ID enables studies of RNA metabolism on the level of single RNA molecules and isoforms in different cell states and conditions.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Native molecule sequencing by nano-ID reveals synthesis and stability of RNA isoforms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/native_molecule_sequencing_by_nano-id_reveals_synthesis_and_stability_of_rna_isoforms_58710054/"},{"date":"2019-04-08T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryStructural and biochemical studies have revealed the basic principles of how the replisome duplicates genomic DNA, but little is known about its dynamics during DNA replication.

Each genomic locus has been overwritten so many times by recombination that it is impossible to reconstruct the clonal phylogeny and, instead of a consensus phylogeny, the phylogeny typically changes many thousands of times along the core genome alignment.We also show how SNP splits can be used to quantify the relative rates with which different subsets of strains have recombined in the past. We find that virtually every strain has a unique pattern of recombination frequencies with other strains and that the relative rates with which different subsets of strains share SNPs follow long-tailed distributions. Our findings show that bacterial populations are neither clonal nor freely recombining, but structured such that recombination rates between different lineages vary along a continuum spanning several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage.

Trio sequencing has been demonstrated to produce a higher diagnostic yield than singleton (proband-only) sequencing. Parental sequencing is especially useful when a disease is suspected to be caused by a de novo variant in the proband, because parental data provide a strong filter for the majority of variants that are shared by the proband and their parents. However the additional cost of sequencing the parents makes the trio strategy uneconomical for many clinical situations. With two thirds of the sequencing budget being spent on parents, these are funds that could be used to sequence more probands. For this reason many clinics are reluctant to sequence parents.Here we propose a pooled-parent strategy for exome sequencing of individuals with likely de novo disease. In this strategy, DNA from all the parents of a cohort of unrelated probands is pooled together into a single exome capture and sequencing run. Variants called in the proband can then be filtered if they are also found in the parent pool, resulting in a shorter list of prioritised variants. To evaluate the pooled-parent strategy we performed a series of simulations by combining reads from individual exomes to imitate sample pooling. We assessed the recall and false positive rate and investigated the trade-off between pool size and recall rate. We compared the performance of GATK HaplotypeCaller individual and joint calling, and FreeBayes to genotype pooled samples. Finally, we applied a pooled-parent strategy to a set of real unsolved cases and showed that the parent pool is a powerful filter that is complementary to other commonly used variant filters such as population variant frequencies.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Pooled-parent exome sequencing to prioritise de novo variants in genetic disease, bioRxiv, 2019-04-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/pooled-parent_exome_sequencing_to_prioritise_de_novo_variants_in_genetic_disease_58691911/"},{"date":"2019-04-06T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractOur capacity to jointly represent information about the world underpins our social experience.

We integrated genetic and official school transcript data from over 3,000 European-ancestry students from U.S. high schools. We used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools. Students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math for more years. Molecular tracer analyses revealed that the dynamics of the math pipeline differed by school advantage. Compared to disadvantaged schools, advantaged schools tracked more students with high polygenic scores into advanced math classes at the start of high school, and they buffered students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. Across all schools, even students with exceptional polygenic scores (top 2%) were unlikely to take the most advanced math classes, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the development of potential STEM talent.

Here, we propose an alternative approach that uses recorded neural responses to directly infer the function performed by a neural network. We assume that the goal of the network can be expressed via a reward function, which describes how desirable each state of the network is for carrying out a given objective. This allows us to frame the problem of optimising each neuron’s responses by viewing neurons as agents in a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm; likewise the problem of inferring the reward function from the observed dynamics can be treated using inverse RL.

PIRATE builds upon recent scalable software developments to allow for the rapid interrogation of thousands of isolates. PIRATE clusters genes (or other annotated features) over a wide range of amino-acid or nucleotide identity thresholds and uses the clustering information to rapidly classify paralogous gene families into either putative fissionfusion events or gene duplications. Furthermore, PIRATE orders the pangenome using a directed graph, provides a measure of allelic variation and estimates sequence divergence for each gene family. We demonstrate that PIRATE scales linearly with both number of samples and computation resources, allowing for analysis of large genomic datasets, and compares favorably to other popular tools.

Previous top-down models addressed this question by comparing the behaviour of an ideal model circuit, optimised to perform a given function, with neural recordings. However, this requires guessing in advance what function is being performed, which may not be possible for many neural systems. To address this, we propose a new framework for optimising a recurrent network using multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL). In this framework, a reward function quantifies how desirable each state of the network is for performing a given function. Each neuron is treated as an ‘agent’, which optimises its responses so as to drive the network towards rewarded states. Three applications follow from this. First, one can use multi-agent RL algorithms to optimise a recurrent neural network to perform diverse functions (e.g. efficient sensory coding or motor control). Second, one could use inverse RL to infer the function of a recorded neural network from data. Third, the theory predicts how neural networks should adapt their dynamics to maintain the same function when the external environment or network structure changes. This could lead to theoretical predictions about how neural network dynamics adapt to deal with cell death andor varying sensory stimulus statistics.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Training and inferring neural network function with multi-agent reinforcement learning, bioRxiv, 2019-04-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/training_and_inferring_neural_network_function_with_multi-agent_reinforcement_learning_58604703/"},{"date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","description":"Naturally-occurring cell death is a fundamental developmental mechanism for regulating cell numbers and sculpting developing organs. This is particularly true in the central nervous system, where large numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes are eliminated via apoptosis during normal development. Given the profound impact of death upon these two major cell populations, it is surprising that developmental death of another major cell type – the astrocyte – has rarely been studied. It is presently unclear whether astrocytes are subject to significant amounts of developmental death, or how it occurs. Here we address these questions using mouse retinal astrocytes as our model system. We show that the total number of retinal astrocytes declines by over 3-fold during a death period spanning postnatal days 5-14. Surprisingly, these astrocytes do not die by apoptosis, the canonical mechanism underlying the vast majority of developmental cell death. Instead, we find that microglia kill and engulf astrocytes to mediate their developmental removal. Genetic ablation of microglia inhibits astrocyte death, leading to a larger astrocyte population size at the end of the death period. However, astrocyte death is not completely blocked in the absence of microglia, apparently due to the ability of astrocytes to engulf each other. Nevertheless, mice lacking microglia showed significant anatomical changes to the retinal astrocyte network, with functional consequences for the astrocyte-associated vasculature leading to retinal hemorrhage. These results establish a novel modality for naturally-occurring cell death, and demonstrate its importance for formation and integrity of the retinal gliovascular network.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Large-scale death of retinal astrocytes during normal development mediated by microglia, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/large-scale_death_of_retinal_astrocytes_during_normal_development_mediated_by_microglia_58453924/"},{"date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCRISPRCas9 nucleases are powerful genome engineering tools, but unwanted cleavage at off-target and previously edited sites remains a major concern.

Moreover, dRNAs can prevent cleavage of homology-directed repair (HDR)-corrected sites, facilitating “scarless” editing by eliminating the need for blocking mutations.

In theory, selfing increases homozygosity at a rate of 0.50 per generation. Increased homozygosity can uncover recessive deleterious variants and lead to inbreeding depression, unless it is countered by the loss of these variants by genetic purging. Here we investigated the dynamics of purging on genomic scale by testing three predictions. The first was that heterozygous, putatively deleterious SNPs were preferentially lost from the genome during continued selfing. The second was that the loss of deleterious SNPs varied as a function of recombination rate, because recombination increases the efficacy of selection by uncoupling linked variants. Finally, we predicted that genome size (GS) decreases during selfing, due to the purging of deleterious transposable element (TE) insertions. We tested these three predictions by following GS and SNP variants in a series of selfed maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) lines over six generations. In these lines, putatively deleterious alleles were purged, and purging was more pronounced in highly recombining regions. Homozygosity increased more slowly than expected; instead of increasing by 50% each generation, it increased by 35% to 40%. Finally, three lines showed dramatic decreases in GS, losing an average of 398 Mb from their genomes over the short timeframe of our experiment. TEs were the principal component of loss, and GS loss was more likely for lineages that began with more TE and more chromosomal knob repeats. Overall, this study documented remarkable GS loss – as much DNA as three Arabidopsis thaliana genomes, on average - in only a few generations of selfing.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The Genomics of Selfing in Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) Catching Purging in the Act, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_genomics_of_selfing_in_maize_zea_mays_ssp._mays_catching_purging_in_the_act_58540859/"},{"date":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolyploidy generates diversity by increasing the number of copies of each chromosome.

However, the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, by analysing several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse, we uncover a requirement for mutant mRNA degradation. Alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional adaptation, and these alleles give rise to more severe phenotypes than alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay reveals the upregulation of a substantial proportion of the genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene's mRNA, suggesting a sequence-dependent mechanism.

Although the pathogenesis of CRC in CF remains unclear, altered host-microbe interactions might play a critical role. Here, we characterize the changes in the gut microbiome and host gene expression in colonic mucosa of CF patients relative to healthy controls. We find that CF patients show decreased microbial diversity, decreased abundance of taxa such as Butyricimonas, Sutterella, and Ruminococcaceae, and increased abundance of other taxa, such as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. We find that 1543 genes, including CFTR, show differential expression in the colon of CF patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, we find that these genes are enriched with functions related to gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, such as metastasis of CRC, tumor suppression, cellular dysfunction, p53 and mTOR signaling pathways. Lastly, we modeled associations between relative abundances of specific bacterial taxa in the gut mucosa and host gene expression, and identified CRC-related genes, including LCN2 and DUOX2, for which gene expression is correlated with the abundance of CRC-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae and Veillonella.

In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier.

Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression.

Thirty-one previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p\u0026lt;0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p\u0026lt;0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, both myosin and actin concentrations decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p\u0026lt;0.05). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p\u0026lt;0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. \u0026lt;0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value \u0026lt;0.05) a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins).

We generated \u0026gt;50,000 mutations in the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PRD) and observed that changes in hydrophobicity and aggregation potential are highly predictive of changes in toxicity.

Mutations have their strongest effects in a central region of the PRD, with variants that increase toxicity promoting the formation of more dynamic liquid-like condensates. The genetic interactions in double mutants reveal that specific structures exist in this ‘unstructured’ region in vivo. Our results demonstrate that deep mutagenesis is a powerful approach for probing the sequence-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins as well as their in vivo structural conformations.

We identified thousands of regions across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength, contact insulation, contact directionality and density of localciscontacts. We mapped hundreds of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes as well as complex disease risk. Our results demonstrate that common DNA sequence variants can influence 3D chromatin conformation, pointing to a more pervasive role for 3D chromatin conformation in human phenotypic variation than previously recognized.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Common DNA sequence variation influences 3-dimensional conformation of the human genome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/common_dna_sequence_variation_influences_3-dimensional_conformation_of_the_human_genome_58114643/"},{"date":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractFast object tracking in real time allows convenient tracking of very large numbers of animals and closed-loop experiments that control stimuli for multiple animals in parallel.

Such tradeoffs define Pareto fronts, which represent a set of optimal individuals that cannot be improved in any one trait without reducing performance in another. Surprisingly, experimental evolution often yields genotypes with improved performance in all measured traits, perhaps indicating an absence of tradeoffs at least in the short-term. Here we densely sample adaptive mutations in S. cerevisiae to ask whether first-step adaptive mutations result in tradeoffs during the growth cycle. We isolated thousands of adaptive clones evolved under carefully chosen conditions and quantified their performances in each part of the growth cycle. We too find that some first-step adaptive mutations can improve all traits to a modest extent. However, our dense sampling allowed us to identify tradeoffs and establish the existence of Pareto fronts between fermentation and respiration, and between respiration and stationary phases. Moreover, we establish that no single mutation in the ancestral genome can circumvent the detected tradeoffs. Finally, we sequenced hundreds of these adaptive clones, revealing novel targets of adaptation and defining the genetic basis of the identified tradeoffs.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Single Nucleotide Mapping of the Locally Accessible Trait Space in Yeast Reveals Pareto Fronts that Constrain Initial Adaptation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-30","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/single_nucleotide_mapping_of_the_locally_accessible_trait_space_in_yeast_reveals_pareto_fronts_that_constrain_initial_adaptation_58119203/"},{"date":"2019-03-30T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractTracking small animal behavior by video is one of the most common tasks in the fields of neuroscience and psychology.

Moreover, the inaccessibility of the code underlying this software renders them inflexible. Alternatively, available open source options frequently require extensive model training and can be challenging for those inexperienced with programming. Here we present an open source and platform independent set of behavior analysis pipelines using interactive Python (iPythonJupyter Notebook) that researchers with no prior programming experience can use. Two modules are described. One module can be used for the positional analysis of an individual animal across a session (i.e., location tracking), amenable to a wide range of behavioral tasks including conditioned place preference, water maze, light-dark box, open field, and elevated plus maze, to name but a few. A second module is described for the analysis of conditioned freezing behavior. For both modules, a range of interactive plots and visualizations are available to confirm that chosen parameters produce results that conform to the user’s approval. In addition, batch processing tools for the fast analysis of multiple videos is provided, and frame-by-frame output makes aligning the data with neural recording data simple.

We here present a new importance sampling approach for approximating the full likelihood function for the selection coefficient. The method treats the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) as a latent variable that is integrated out using previously published Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The method can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, testing models of changes in the strength of selection, estimating the time of the start of a selective sweep, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the method and show that it uniformly improves power to detect selection compared to current popular methods such as nSL and SDS, under various demographic models and can provide reliable inferences of allele frequency trajectories under many conditions. We also explore the potential of our method to detect extremely recent changes in the strength of selection. We use the method to infer the past allele frequency trajectory for a lactase persistence SNP (MCM6) in Europeans. We also study a set of 11 pigmentation-associated variants. Several genes show evidence of strong selection particularly within the last 5,000 years, including ASIP, KITLG, and TYR. However, selection on OCA2HERC2 seems to be much older and, in contrast to previous claims, we find no evidence of selection on TYRP1.Author summaryCurrent methods to study natural selection using modern population genomic data are limited in their power and flexibility.

We show our method improves power to test for selection over competing methods across a diverse range of scenarios, and also accurately infers the selection coefficient.

However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation of PRS is that those available today are several times more accurate in individuals of European ancestry than other ancestries. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric biases in genome-wide association studies, thus highlighting that—unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations—clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement for European-descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in leveling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date.

However, a comprehensive analysis of their data reveals a number of issues that must be carefully addressed before challenging the current paradigm. Unfortunately, the methods section lacks any description of sample management, validation of their results in independent laboratories was deficient, and the reported findings have been observed at a frequency at complete variance with established evidence. Moreover, the remarkably high (and unusually homogeneous) levels of heteroplasmy reported can be readily detected using classical techniques for DNA sequencing. By reassessing the raw sequencing data with an alternative computational pipeline, we report strong correlation to the NextGENe results provided by the authors on a per sample base. However, the sequencing replicates from the same donors show aberrations in the variants detected that need further investigation to exclude contributions from other sources or methodological artifacts. Finally, applying the principle of reductio ad absurdum, we demonstrate that the nuclear factor invoked by the authors would need to be extraordinarily complex and precise in order to preclude linear accumulation of mtDNA lineages across generations.

In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 135 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney p \u0026lt; 0.0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival Flt3L ≤ 291pgml was associated with inferior event-free survival; and, Flt3L \u0026gt;1185pgml was associated with higher overall survival (p = 0.0119). Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML further illustrated the potential value of declining Flt3L to identify relapse. Together these observations suggest that measurement of Flt3L provides a non-invasive estimate of progenitor cell mass in most patients with AML, with the potential to inform clinical decisions.Graphical abstract\u003cjatsfig id=ufig1 position=float fig-type=figure orientation=portrait\u003e\u003cjatsgraphic xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink xlinkhref=588319_ufig1 position=float orientation=portrait \u003e","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Serum Flt3 ligand is biomarker of progenitor cell mass and prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, bioRxiv, 2019-03-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/serum_flt3_ligand_is_biomarker_of_progenitor_cell_mass_and_prognosis_in_acute_myeloid_leukemia_57683166/"},{"date":"2019-03-24T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCell-fate in eukaryotes is regulated by MAP Kinases (MAPKs) that translate external cues to cellular responses. In plants, two MAPKs, MPK36, regulate diverse processes of development, environmental response, and immunity. Yet, the mechanism bridging these shared signaling components with a specific target remains unresolved. Focusing on the development of stomata, epidermal valves for gas exchange and transpiration, we report here that the bHLH protein SCREAM functions as a scaffold by recruiting MPK36 to downregulate SPEECHLESS, a transcription factor initiating stomatal cell lineages. SCREAM directly binds with MPK36 through an evolutionarily-conserved yet unconventional bipartite motif. Mutations in this motif abrogate association, phosphorylation and degradation of SCREAM, unmask hidden non-redundancies between MPK3 and MPK6, and result in uncontrolled stomatal differentiation. Structural analyses of MPK6 at the 2.75Å resolution unraveled bipartite binding of SCREAM with MPK6, that is distinct from an upstream MAPKK. Our findings elucidate, at the atomic resolution, the mechanism directly linking extrinsic signals to transcriptional reprogramming during the establishment of stomatal cell-fate, and highlight a unique substrate-binding mode adopted by plant MAPKs.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Bipartite anchoring of SCREAM enforces stomatal initiation by coupling MAP Kinases to SPEECHLESS, bioRxiv, 2019-03-24","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/bipartite_anchoring_of_scream_enforces_stomatal_initiation_by_coupling_map_kinases_to_speechless_57606705/"},{"date":"2019-03-24T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCharacterizing the mode – the way, manner, or pattern – of evolution in tumours is important for clinical forecasting and optimizing cancer treatment.

Despite its utility, whole genome sequencing of pathogens has not been adopted universally and targeted sequencing of loci is common in some pathogen-specific fields. In this study we aim to highlight the utility of sequencing whole genomes of pathogens by re-analysing a well-characterised collection of Ebola virus sequences in the form of complete viral genomes (~19kb long) or the rapidly evolving glycoprotein (GP, ~2kb long) gene. We quantify changes in phylogenetic, temporal, and spatial inference resolution as a result of this reduction in data and compare these to theoretical expectations.

We developed and used a portable IAV sequencing and analysis platform called Mia (Mobile Influenza Analysis) to complete and characterize full-length consensus genomes approximately 18 hours after unpacking the mobile lab. Swine are important animal IAV reservoirs that have given rise to pandemic viruses via zoonotic transmission. Genomic analyses of IAV in swine are critical to understanding pandemic risk of viruses in this reservoir, and characterization of viruses circulating in exhibition swine enables rapid comparison to current seasonal influenza vaccines and CVVs. The Mia system rapidly identified three genetically distinct swine IAV lineages from three subtypes A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and A(H1N2). Additional analysis of the HA protein sequences of the A(H1N2) viruses identified \u0026gt;30 amino acid differences between the HA1 portion of the hemagglutinin of these viruses and the most closely related pre-2009 CVV. All virus sequences were emailed to colleagues at CDC who initiated development of a synthetically derived CVV designed to provide an optimal antigenic match with the viruses detected in the exhibition. In subsequent months, this virus caused 13 infections in humans, and was the dominant variant virus in the US detected in 2018.

We recorded electrocardiography (ECG) in 26 subjects who formed 13 dyads containing an action executioner and observer as they performed a self-paced sequence of movements. We demonstrated that heartbeats are timed to movements during both action execution and observation. Specifically, movements were more likely to culminate between heartbeats than simultaneously with the heartbeat. The same pattern was observed for action observation, with the observer’s heartbeats occurring off-phase with movement culmination. These findings demonstrate that there is synchronicity between an action executioner’s cardiac cycle and the timing of their movements, and that the same relationship is mirrored in an observer.

Diverse organisms employ structural color to mediate ecological interactions and create specific optical effects such as iridescence. Despite its importance for living systems, the developmental, genetic, and evolutionary processes that generate structural color largely remain mysterious. Here, we focus on simple photonic structures, thin film reflectors, in the lower lamina of Junonia butterfly scales. We present multiple lines of evidence that the thickness of the lamina quantitatively controls lamina color, which is an important determinant of overall wing color, even when pigments are also present. First, in a lineage of buckeye butterflies artificially selected for blue wing color for 12 generations, a thicker lamina resulted in a color shift from brown to blue. A similar lamina thickness increase explains the appearance of blue scales in butterflies with mutations in the optix wing patterning gene. Finally, lamina thickness variation underlies the color diversity that distinguishes seasonal variants, sexes, and species throughout the genus Junonia. Thus, quantitatively tuning a single dimension of the existing scale architecture allows butterflies to evolve a broad spectrum of hues over both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary time frames. Because the lower lamina is an intrinsic component of typical butterfly scales, our findings imply that lamina structural color influences wing color in most butterflies.Significance StatementStructural colors, which result from photonic nanostructures that refract light and can create iridescence, are an important tool for many organisms. We use thin films, which are morphologically simple nanostructures that generate structural color in the lower lamina of butterfly scales, to dissect how photonic structures evolve. By combining interspecies comparisons with two different experimental approaches—artificial selection on wing color, and genetically engineered mutation of the optix wing patterning gene—we demonstrate that lamina thickness controls the wavelength (hue) of the structural color. These lamina structural colors are ubiquitous in the genus Junonia, and determine wing color along with pigments. Our results suggest that lamina structural colors probably exist in most butterflies, and that tuning lamina thickness facilitates wing color evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Structural color in Junonia butterflies evolves by tuning scale lamina thickness, bioRxiv, 2019-03-22","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/structural_color_in_junonia_butterflies_evolves_by_tuning_scale_lamina_thickness_57449863/"},{"date":"2019-03-21T00:00:00Z","description":"A series of studies have documented how Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry reached central Europe by at least 2500 BCE, while Iranian farmer-related ancestry was present in Aegean Europe by at least 1900 BCE. However, the spread of these ancestries into the western Mediterranean where they have contributed to many populations living today remains poorly understood. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA from the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals with reported data from these islands from 3 to 52. We obtained data from the oldest skeleton excavated from the Balearic islands (dating to ∼2400 BCE), and show that this individual had substantial Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry; however, later Balearic individuals had less Steppe heritage reflecting geographic heterogeneity or immigration from groups with more European first farmer-related ancestry. In Sicily, Steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived by ∼2200 BCE and likely came at least in part from Spain as it was associated with Iberian-specific Y chromosomes. In Sicily, Iranian-related ancestry also arrived by the Middle Bronze Age, thus revealing that this ancestry type, which was ubiquitous in the Aegean by this time, also spread further west prior to the classical period of Greek expansion. In Sardinia, we find no evidence of either eastern ancestry type in the Nuragic Bronze Age, but show that Iranian-related ancestry arrived by at least ∼300 BCE and Steppe ancestry arrived by ∼300 CE, joined at that time or later by North African ancestry.

Here we argue that much of an animal’s behavioral repertoire is not the result of clever learning algorithms—supervised or unsupervised—but arises instead from behavior programs already present at birth. These programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly.

Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity some grow on glucose while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells’ phenotype prior to the switch it is highest for cells crossfeeding on acetate, while it depends in a non-monotonic way on growth rate for cells growing on glucose.

As national biobanks, human disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population references for small variants (i.e., SNVs \u0026amp; indels) in protein-coding genes, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. However, no comparable large-scale reference maps for SVs exist to date. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis, in the general population. The mutation rates and densities of SVs were non-uniform across chromosomes and SV classes. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reflect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. The average genome in gnomAD-SV harbored 8,202 SVs, and approximately eight genes altered by rare SVs. When incorporating these data with pLoF SNVs, we estimate that SVs comprise at least 25% of all rare pLoF events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼132 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental finding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted differences in frequencies across populations and confirmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants. In total, gnomAD-SV includes at least one CNV covering 57% of the genome, while the remaining 43% is significantly enriched for CNVs found in tumors and individuals with developmental disorders. However, current sample sizes remain markedly underpowered to establish estimates of SV constraint on the level of individual genes or noncoding loci.

Even in this minimal system, a change in gene expression altered both the strength and type of genetic interactions. These seemingly complicated changes could, however, be predicted by a mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype.

Despite this, we find that at least 213 transcripts (~5%) have arisende novoin the past 20 million years of evolution of baker’s yeast-or approximately 10 new transcripts every million years. Nearly half of the total newly expressed sequences are generated from regions in which both DNA strands are used as templates for transcription, explaining the apparent contradiction between the limited ‘empty’ genomic space and high rate ofde novogene birth. In addition, we find that 40% of thesede novotranscripts are actively translated and that at least a fraction of the encoded proteins are likely to be under purifying selection. This study shows that even in very highly compact genomes,de novotranscripts are continuously generated and can give rise to new functional protein-coding genes.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Frequent birth ofde novogenes in the compact yeast genome, bioRxiv, 2019-03-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/frequent_birth_ofde_novogenes_in_the_compact_yeast_genome_56953060/"},{"date":"2019-03-13T00:00:00Z","description":"Miscarriage is a common complex trait that affects 10-25% of clinically confirmed pregnancies1,2.

However, they are unsurprisingly imperfect reflections of humans, and the extent and nature of many immunological differences are unknown. With the rise of targeted and biological therapeutics, it is increasingly important that we understand the molecular differences in immunological behavior of humans and model organisms. Thus, we profiled a large number of healthy humans, along with three of the model organisms most similar to humans rhesus and cynomolgus macaques and African green monkeys; and the most widely used mammalian model mice. Using cross-species, universal phenotyping and signaling panels, we measured immune cell signaling responses to an array of 15 stimuli using CyTOF mass cytometry. We found numerous instances of different cellular phenotypes and immune signaling events occurring within and between species with likely effects on evaluation of therapeutics, and detail three examples (double-positive T cell frequency and signaling; granulocyte response to Bacillus anthracis antigen; and B cell subsets).

However, data from large-scale citizen science projects typically present a number of challenges that can inhibit robust ecological inferences. These challenges include species bias, spatial bias, variation in effort, and variation in observer skill.To demonstrate key challenges in analysing citizen science data, we use the example of estimating species distributions with data from eBird, a large semi-structured citizen science project. We estimate three widely applied metrics for describing species distributions encounter rate, occupancy probability, and relative abundance. For each method, we outline approaches for data processing and modelling that are suitable for using citizen science data for estimating species distributions.Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from citizen science data. The largest gains in model performance were achieved with two key processes 1) the use of complete checklists rather than presence-only data, and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Including these covariates accounted for heterogeneity in detectability and reporting, and resulted in substantial differences in predicted distributions. The data processing and analytical steps we outlined led to improved model performance across a range of sample sizes.When using citizen science data it is imperative to carefully consider the appropriate data processing and analytical procedures required to address the bias and variation. Here, we describe the consequences and utility of applying our suggested approach to semi-structured citizen science data to estimate species distributions.

Here, in a sample of 286,301 participants from UK Biobank, we identified 30 independent genome-wide significant loci, 29 novel, that are associated with household income. Using a recently-developed method to meta-analyze data that leverages power from genetically-correlated traits, we identified an additional 120 income-associated loci. These loci showed clear evidence of functional enrichment, with transcriptional differences identified across multiple cortical tissues, in addition to links with GABAergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. We identified neurogenesis and the components of the synapse as candidate biological systems that are linked with income. By combining our GWAS on income with data from eQTL studies and chromatin interactions, 24 genes were prioritized for follow up, 18 of which were previously associated with cognitive ability. Using Mendelian Randomization, we identified cognitive ability as one of the causal, partly-heritable phenotypes that bridges the gap between molecular genetic inheritance and phenotypic consequence in terms of income differences. Significant differences between genetic correlations indicated that, the genetic variants associated with income are related to better mental health than those linked to educational attainment (another commonly-used marker of SEP).

The increased susceptibility of land plants is largely thought to be due to their dependence on micro-organisms for nutrients; the ensuing co-evolution has shaped the plant immune system. By profiling the immune receptors across flowering plants, we identified species with low numbers of NLR immune receptors. Interestingly, four of these species represent distinct lineages of monocots and dicots that returned to the aquatic lifestyle. Both aquatic monocot and dicot species lost the same well-known downstream immune signalling complex (EDS1-PAD4). This observation inspired us to look for other genes with a similar loss pattern and allowed us to predict putative new components of plant immunity. Gene expression analyses confirmed that a group of these genes was differentially expressed under pathogen infection. Excitingly, another subset of these genes was differentially expressed upon drought. Collectively, our study reveals the minimal plant immune system required for life under water, and highlights additional components required for the life of land plants.Author summaryPlant resistance to pathogens is commonly mediated by a complex gene family, known as NLRs. Upon pathogen infection, changes in the cellular environment trigger NLR activation and subsequent defence responses. Despite the dependence of agricultural practices on NLR genes to control pathogen load, relatively little is known about this gene family outside of model crop species. In this study, we identified a convergent reduction in the NLR gene family among two lineages of aquatic plants. Furthermore, we established that NLR reduction occurred in conjunction with the loss of a common immune signalling pathway. Subsequently, we identified other genes convergently lost in aquatic species and propose these as candidate components of the plant immune signalling pathway. In addition, we revealed components of the agronomically important drought response to be lost in aquatic plants. This study adds to our understanding of the complex interactions between environment and response to biotic stress, widely known as the disease triangle. The pathways identified in this study shed further light on the link between responses to drought and disease.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Convergent gene loss in aquatic plants predicts new components of plant immunity and drought response, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/convergent_gene_loss_in_aquatic_plants_predicts_new_components_of_plant_immunity_and_drought_response_56826634/"},{"date":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPlant innate immunity relies on NLR receptors that recognize pathogen derived molecules and activate downstream signalling pathways.

Our results reveal a send-receive cortical hierarchy that recapitulates established organizational gradients differentiating sensory-motor and multimodal areas. We find that send-receive asymmetries are significantly associated with the directionality of effective connectivity derived from spectral dynamic causal modeling.

Here, we systematically survey MNVs in 125,748 whole exomes and 15,708 whole genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD).

We illustrate the power of characterizing loss of function variation in this large population through association analyses across 1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of established associations, we discover novel loss of function variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 and GMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of pathogenic variants of clinical significance in this population, finding that 2% of the population has a medically actionable variant. Additionally, we leverage the phenotypic data to characterize the relationship between rare BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and cancer risk.

By analysing the spectrum of variant allele frequencies we quantify fitness advantages for key pathogenic variants and genes and provide bounds on the number of haematopoietic stem cells. Positive selection, not drift, is the major force shaping clonal haematopoiesis. The remarkably wide variation in variant allele frequencies observed across individuals is driven by chance differences in the timing of mutation acquisition combined with differences in the cell-intrinsic fitness effect of variants. Contrary to the widely held view that clonal haematopoiesis is driven by ageing-related alterations in the stem cell niche, the data are consistent with the age dependence being driven simply by continuing risk of mutations and subsequent clonal expansions that lead to increased detectability at older ages.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The evolutionary dynamics and fitness landscape of clonal haematopoiesis, bioRxiv, 2019-03-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_evolutionary_dynamics_and_fitness_landscape_of_clonal_haematopoiesis_56620613/"},{"date":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIntroductionCompounds present in Cannabis sativa such as phytocannabinoids and terpenoids, may act in concert to elicit therapeutic effects. Cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) directly activate cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), however, it is not known if terpenoids present in Cannabis also affect cannabinoid receptor signalling. Therefore, we examined 6 common terpenoids alone, and in combination with cannabinoid receptor agonists, on CB1 and CB2 signalling in vitro.Materials and MethodsPotassium channel activity in AtT20 FlpIn cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptors was measured in real-time using FLIPR® membrane potential dye in a FlexStation 3 plate reader. Terpenoids were tested individually and in combination for periods up to 30 minutes. Endogenous somatostatin receptors served as a control for direct effects of drugs on potassium channels.Resultsα-Pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, linalool, limonene and β-myrcene (up to 30-100 µM) did not change membrane potential in AtT20 cells expressing CB1 or CB2, or affect the response to a maximally effective concentration of the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940. The presence of individual or a combination of terpenoids did not affect the hyperpolarization produced by Δ9-THC (10µM) (CB1 control, 59±7%; with terpenoids (10 µM each) 55±4%; CB2 Δ9-THC 16±5%, with terpenoids (10 µM each) 17±4%). To investigate possible effect on desensitization of CB1 responses, all six terpenoids were added together with Δ9-THC and signalling measured continuously over 30 min. Terpenoids did not affect desensitization, after 30 minutes the control hyperpolarization recovered by 63±6%, in the presence of the terpenoids recovery was 61±5%.DiscussionNone of the six of the most common terpenoids in Cannabis directly activated CB1 or CB2, or modulated the signalling of the phytocannabinoid agonist Δ9-THC. These results suggest that if a phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effect exists, it is not at the CB1 or CB2 receptor level. It remains possible that terpenoids activate CB1 and CB2 signalling pathways that do not involve potassium channels, however, it seems more likely that they may act at different molecular target(s) in the neuronal circuits important for the behavioural effect of Cannabis.","tags":["biorxiv","pharmacology-and-toxicology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Absence of entourage Terpenoids commonly found in Cannabis sativa do not modulate the functional activity of Δ9-THC at human CB1and CB2 receptors, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/absence_of_entourage_terpenoids_commonly_found_in_cannabis_sativa_do_not_modulate_the_functional_activity_of_%CE%B49-thc_at_human_cb1and_cb2_receptors_56582898/"},{"date":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health.

Our findings support a model of a higher-order chromatin architecture on the size level of TADs that creates and modulates distinct functional environments through a combination of biophysical parameters such as density and ATP-driven processes such as replication and transcription, but independent of cohesin.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Chromatin arranges in filaments of blobs with nanoscale functional zonation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/chromatin_arranges_in_filaments_of_blobs_with_nanoscale_functional_zonation_56456514/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe genome is organized in megabase-sized three-dimensional units, called Topologically Associated Domains (TADs), that are separated by boundaries. TADs bring distant cis-regulatory elements into proximity, a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA binding factor CTCF. Surprisingly, genome-wide depletion of CTCF has little effect on transcription, yet structural variations affecting TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and congenital disease. Here, we investigate TAD function in vivo in mice by systematically editing components of TAD organization at the Sox9Kcnj locus. We find that TADs are formed by a redundant system of CTCF sites requiring the removal of all major sites within the TAD and at the boundary for two neighboring TADs to fuse. TAD fusion resulted in leakage of regulatory activity from the Sox9 to the Kcnj TAD, but no major changes in gene expression. This indicates that TAD structures provide robustness and precision, but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Gene misexpression and resulting disease phenotypes, however, were attained by re-directing regulatory activity through inversions andor the re-positioning of boundaries. Thus, efficient re-wiring of enhancer promoter interaction and aberrant disease causing gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires the re-direction of contacts.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Functional dissection of TADs reveals non-essential and instructive roles in regulating gene expression, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/functional_dissection_of_tads_reveals_non-essential_and_instructive_roles_in_regulating_gene_expression_56502379/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPseudoplanktonic crinoid megaraft colonies are an enigma of the Jurassic. They are among the largest in-situ invertebrate accumulations ever to exist in the Phanerozoic fossil record. These megaraft colonies and are thought to have developed as floating filter-feeding communities due to an exceptionally rich relatively predator free oceanic niche, high in the water column enabling them to reach high densities on these log rafts. However, this pseudoplanktonic hypothesis has never actually been quantitatively tested and some researchers have cast doubt that this mode of life was even possible. The ecological structure of the crinoid colony is resolved using spatial point process techniques and its longevity using moisture diffusion models. Using spatial analysis we found that the crinoids would have trailed preferentially positioned at the back of migrating structures in the regions of least resistance, consistent with a floating, not benthic ecology. Additionally, we found using a series of moisture diffusion models at different log densities and sizes that ecosystem collapse did not take place solely due to colonies becoming overladen as previously assumed. We have found that these crinoid colonies studied could have existed for greater than 10 years, even up to 20 years exceeding the life expectancy of modern documented megaraft systems with implications for the role of modern raft communities in the biotic colonisation of oceanic islands and intercontinental dispersal of marine and terrestrial species.Significance statementTransoceanic rafting is the principle mechanism for the biotic colonisation of oceanic island ecosystems. However, no historic records exist of how long such biotic systems lasted. Here, we use a deep-time example from the Early Jurassic to test the viability of these pseudoplanktonic systems, resolving for the first time whether these systems were truly free floating planktonic and viable for long enough to allow its inhabitants to grow to maturity. Using spatial methods we show that these colonies have a comparable structure to modern marine pesudoplankton on maritime structures, whilst the application of methods normally used in commercial logging is used to demonstrate the viability of the system which was capable of lasting up to 20 years.","tags":["biorxiv","paleontology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Reconstructing the ecology of a Jurassic pseudoplanktonic megaraft colony, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/reconstructing_the_ecology_of_a_jurassic_pseudoplanktonic_megaraft_colony_56514437/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIntegrative analysis of multi-omics data is a powerful approach for gaining functional insights into biological and medical processes.

However, evolving resistance to one drug may come at a cost of decreased growth rate or increased sensitivity to another drug due to evolutionary trade-offs. This weakness can be exploited in the clinic using an approach called ‘evolutionary herding’ that aims at controlling the tumour cell population to delay or prevent resistance. However, recapitulating cancer evolutionary dynamics experimentally remains challenging. Here we present a novel approach for evolutionary herding based on a combination of single-cell barcoding, very large populations of 108–109 cells grown without re-plating, longitudinal non-destructive monitoring of cancer clones, and mathematical modelling of tumour evolution. We demonstrate evolutionary herding in non-small cell lung cancer, showing that herding allows shifting the clonal composition of a tumour in our favour, leading to collateral drug sensitivity and proliferative fitness costs. Through genomic analysis and single-cell sequencing, we were also able to determine the mechanisms that drive such evolved sensitivity. Our approach allows modelling evolutionary trade-offs experimentally to test patient-specific evolutionary herding strategies that can potentially be translated into the clinic to control treatment resistance.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Exploiting evolutionary herding to control drug resistance in cancer, bioRxiv, 2019-03-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/exploiting_evolutionary_herding_to_control_drug_resistance_in_cancer_56453707/"},{"date":"2019-03-04T00:00:00Z","description":"Cells regulate gene expression in response to salient external stimuli.

However, it is unclear if different types of depolarizing signals can be transformed by an ITF into distinct modes of genomic regulation. Here, we show that APs and EPSPs in the murine hippocampus trigger two spatially segregated and molecularly distinct mechanisms that lead to the expression of the ITF NPAS4. These two pathways culminate in the assembly of unique, stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers that exhibit distinctive DNA binding patterns.

However, there are few real datasets and no simulation protocols currently available that can directly benchmark methods when such large shifts occur.We present absSimSeq, an R package that simulates compositional data in the form of RNA-Seq reads. We tested several tools used for RNA-Seq differential analysis sleuth, DESeq2, edgeR, limma, sleuth and ALDEx2 (which explicitly takes a compositional approach). For these tools, we compared their standard normalization to either “compositional normalization”, which uses log-ratios to anchor the data on a set of negative control features, or RUVSeq, another tool that directly uses negative control features.We show that common normalizations result in reduced performance with current methods when there is a large change in the total RNA per cell. Performance improves when spike-ins are included and used by a compositional approach, even if the spike-ins have substantial variation. In contrast, RUVSeq, which normalizes count data rather than compositional data, has poor performance. Further, we show that previous criticisms of spike-ins did not take into account the compositional nature of the data. We conclude that absSimSeq can generate more representative datasets for testing performance, and that spike-ins should be more broadly used in a compositional manner to minimize misleading conclusions from differential analyses.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Compositional Data Analysis is necessary for simulating and analyzing RNA-Seq data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/compositional_data_analysis_is_necessary_for_simulating_and_analyzing_rna-seq_data_56315555/"},{"date":"2019-03-02T00:00:00Z","description":"Background Proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition reduces plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].

Our objectives were to determine the association between variants in PCSK9 and lipoprotein-lipid levels, coronary artery disease (CAD) and CAVS, and to evaluate if PCSK9 could be implicated in aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) calcification.Methods We built a genetic risk score weight for LDL-C levels (wGRS) using 10 independent PCSK9 single nucleotide polymorphisms and determined its association with lipoprotein-lipid levels in 9692 participants of the EPIC-Norfolk study. We investigated the association between the wGRS and CAD and CAVS in the UK Biobank, as well as the association between the PCSK9 R46L variant and CAVS in a meta-analysis of published prospective, population-based studies (Copenhagen studies, 1463 cases101,620 controls) and unpublished studies (UK Biobank, 1350 cases349,043 controls, Malmo Diet and Cancer study, 682 cases5963 controls and EPIC-Norfolk study, 508 cases20,421 controls). We evaluated PCSK9 expression and localization in explanted aortic valves by capillary Western blot and immunohistochemistry in patients with and without CAVS.

Using a biochemical system that recapitulates key features of cellular NHEJ, we show that end-processing requires formation of a “short-range synaptic complex” in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis.

Results Overall, we identified 100,025 gene-trait associations based on conventional genome-wide corrections (P \u0026lt; 5 x 10-08) that also provided evidence of genetic colocalization.

More than 85% of the sequence of the maize genome can be ascribed to past transposition, providing a major contribution to the structure of the genome. Evidence from individual loci has informed our understanding of how transposition has shaped the genome, and a number of individual TE insertions have been causally linked to dramatic phenotypic changes. But genome-wide analyses in maize and other taxa have frequently represented TEs as a relatively homogeneous class of fragmentary relics of past transposition, obscuring their evolutionary history and interaction with their host genome. Using an updated annotation of structurally intact TEs in the maize reference genome, we investigate the family-level ecological and evolutionary dynamics of TEs in maize. Integrating a variety of data, from descriptors of individual TEs like coding capacity, expression, and methylation, as well as similar features of the sequence they inserted into, we model the relationship between these attributes of the genomic environment and the survival of TE copies and families. Our analyses reveal a diversity of ecological strategies of TE families, each representing the evolution of a distinct ecological niche allowing survival of the TE family. In contrast to the wholesale relegation of all TEs to a single category of junk DNA, these differences generate a rich ecology of the genome, suggesting families of TEs that coexist in time and space compete and cooperate with each other. We conclude that while the impact of transposition is highly family- and context-dependent, a family-level understanding of the ecology of TEs in the genome can refine our ability to predict the role of TEs in generating genetic and phenotypic diversity.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The Genomic Ecosystem of Transposable Elements in Maize, bioRxiv, 2019-03-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_genomic_ecosystem_of_transposable_elements_in_maize_56197313/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"Background The gut microbiome is an important determinant of human health. Its composition has been shown to be influenced by multiple environmental factors and likely by host genetic variation. In the framework of the Milieu Intérieur Consortium, a total of 1,000 healthy individuals of western European ancestry, with a 11 sex ratio and evenly stratified across five decades of life (age 20 - 69), were recruited. We generated 16S ribosomal RNA profiles from stool samples for 858 participants. We investigated genetic and non-genetic factors that contribute to individual differences in fecal microbiome composition.Results Among 110 demographic, clinical and environmental factors, 11 were identified as significantly correlated with α-diversity, β-diversity or abundance of specific microbial communities in multivariable models. Age and blood alanine aminotransferase levels showed the strongest associations with microbiome diversity. In total, all non-genetic factors explained 16.4% of the variance. We then searched for associations between \u0026gt;5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and the same indicators of fecal microbiome diversity, including the significant non-genetic factors as covariates. No genome-wide significant associations were identified after correction for multiple testing. A small fraction of previously reported associations between human genetic variants and specific taxa could be replicated in our cohort, while no replication was observed for any of the diversity metrics.Conclusion In a well-characterized cohort of healthy individuals, we identified several non-genetic variables associated with fecal microbiome diversity. In contrast, host genetics only had a negligible influence. Demographic and environmental factors are thus the main contributors to fecal microbiome composition in healthy individuals.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"A Comprehensive Assessment of Demographic, Environmental and Host Genetic Associations with Gut Microbiome Diversity in Healthy Individuals, bioRxiv, 2019-02-28","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_comprehensive_assessment_of_demographic_environmental_and_host_genetic_associations_with_gut_microbiome_diversity_in_healthy_individuals_56150428/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"N-glycanase 1NGLY1 Deficiency is an ultra-rare and complex monogenic glycosylation disorder that affects fewer than 40 patients globally. NGLY1 Deficiency has been studied in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies and mice. Proteasomal and mitochondrial homeostasisgene networks are controlled by the evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator Nrf1, whose activity requires deglycosylation by NGLY1. Hypersensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a common phenotype observed in whole animal and cellular models of NGLY1Deficiency. Here we describe unbiased phenotypic drug screens to identify FDA approved drugs, generally recognized as safe natural products and novel chemical entities that rescue growth and development of NGLY1-deficient worm and fly larvae treated with a toxic dose of bortezomib. We used image-based larval size and number assays for use in screens of a 2,560-member drug repurposing library and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. A total of 91 validated hit compounds from primary invertebrate screens were tested in a human cell line in a NRF2 activity assay. NRF2 is a transcriptional regulator that regulates cellular redox homeostasis and it can compensate for loss of Nrf1. Plant-based polyphenols comprise the largest class of hit compounds and NRF2 inducers. Catecholamines and catecholamine receptor activators comprise the second largest class of hits.

Normative brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age (10-75 years) from 7 subcortical volumes, 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area, lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 1,147 male and 1,386 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group.

The difference between predicted brain age and chronological age was calculated to indicate brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD). Findings On average, MDD patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +0.90 (SE 0.21) years (Cohen's d=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.17) compared to controls.

Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that species with similar ecological requirements either spatially exclude each other, by preventing the colonization of competitors or by driving coexisting populations to extinction, or show niche divergence when in sympatry. However, the extent and generality of the effect of interspecific competition in trait and biogeographic evolution has been limited by a dearth of appropriate process-generating models to directly test the effect of biotic interactions. Here, we formulate a phylogenetic parametric model that allows interdependence between trait and biogeographic evolution, thus enabling a direct test of central hypotheses on how biotic interactions shape these evolutionary processes. We adopt a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of trait histories, range histories, and co-evolutionary process parameters under this analytically intractable model. Through simulations, we show that our model is capable of distinguishing alternative scenarios of biotic interactions. We apply our model to the radiation of Darwin's finches---a classic example of adaptive divergence---and find support for in situ trait divergence in beak size, convergence in traits such as beak shape and tarsus length, and strong competitive exclusion throughout their evolutionary history. Our modeling framework opens new possibilities for testing more complex hypotheses about the processes underlying lineage diversification.

In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations' dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability in large-scale brain systems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/task-evoked_activity_quenches_neural_correlations_and_variability_in_large-scale_brain_systems_56050434/"},{"date":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractReconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between species is one of the most formidable tasks in evolutionary biology.

Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency andor the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research. Here we designed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer quartet topologies from multiple sequence alignments. This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone. We also demonstrate that the confidence scores produced by our CNN can more accurately assess support for the chosen topology than bootstrap and posterior probability scores from traditional methods.

But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased towards detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls.

Genomic data collected over tens of generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation. Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become stochastically associated with. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance across generations that can be directly measured from temporal genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The Linked Selection Signature of Rapid Adaptation in Temporal Genomic Data, bioRxiv, 2019-02-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_linked_selection_signature_of_rapid_adaptation_in_temporal_genomic_data_55999683/"},{"date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Background elPrep is an established multi-threaded framework for preparing SAM and BAM files in sequencing pipelines. To achieve good performance, its software architecture makes only a single pass through a SAMBAM file for multiple preparation steps, and keeps sequencing data as much as possible in main memory. Similar to other SAMBAM tools, management of heap memory is a complex task in elPrep, and it became a serious productivity bottleneck in its original implementation language during recent further development of elPrep. We therefore investigated three alternative programming languages Go and Java using a concurrent, parallel garbage collector on the one hand, and C++17 using reference counting on the other hand for handling large amounts of heap objects. We reimplemented elPrep in all three languages and benchmarked their runtime performance and memory use.Results The Go implementation performs best, yielding the best balance between runtime performance and memory use. While the Java benchmarks report a somewhat faster runtime than the Go benchmarks, the memory use of the Java runs is significantly higher. The C++17 benchmarks run significantly slower than both Go and Java, while using somewhat more memory than the Go runs. Our analysis shows that concurrent, parallel garbage collection is better at managing a large heap of objects than reference counting in our case.Conclusions Based on our benchmark results, we selected Go as our new implementation language for elPrep, and recommend considering Go as a good candidate for developing other bioinformatics tools for processing SAMBAM data as well.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"A comparison of three programming languages for a full-fledged next-generation sequencing tool, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_comparison_of_three_programming_languages_for_a_full-fledged_next-generation_sequencing_tool_55926319/"},{"date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Most existing coverage-based (epi)genomic datasets are one-dimensional, but newer technologies probing interactions (physical, genetic, etc.) produce quantitative maps with two-dimensional genomic coordinate systems.

For IBT, cells were imaged at 0.2-4 pA ion current across 1,000 axial scans. Consecutive subsets of ion beam images were binned over 3 to 20 slices (above and below) to create a resolved image, wherein binning was incremented one slice at a time to yield an enhanced multi-depth data without loss of depth resolution. Algorithmic deconvolution, tailored for ion beams, was then applied to the transformed ion image series using a hybrid deblurring algorithm and an ion beam current-dependent point-spread function. Three-dimensional processing was implemented by segmentation, mesh, molecular neighborhoods, and association maps. In cultured cancer cells and tissues, IBT enabled accessible visualization of three-dimensional volumetric distributions of genomic regions, RNA transcripts, and protein factors with 65-nm lateral and 5-nm axial resolution. IBT also enabled label-free elemental mapping of cells, allowing point of source cellular component measurements not possible for most optical microscopy targets.

Animal enrichment paradigms often include the addition of environmental diversity, whether in the form of social interaction, novel objects, or exploratory opportunities. Enrichment could plausibly affect intragenotypic variability in opposing ways it could cause an increase in variability due to the increase in microenvironmental variation, or a decrease in variability due to elimination of aberrant behavior as animals are taken out of impoverished laboratory conditions. In order to test our hypothesis, we assayed five isogenic Drosophila melanogaster lines raised in control and mild enrichment conditions, and one isogenic line under both mild and intense enrichment conditions. We compared the mean and variability of six behavioral metrics between our enriched fly populations and the laboratory housing control. We found that enrichment often caused a small increase in variability across most of our behaviors, but that the ultimate effect of enrichment on both behavioral means and variabilities was highly dependent on genotype and its interaction with the particular enrichment treatment.

Previous approaches use phylogenetic trees to estimate branch-specific diversification rates. However, all previous approaches disregard diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages although 99% of species that ever existed are now extinct. Here we describe a lineage-specific birth-death-shift process where lineages, both extant and extinct, may have heterogeneous rates of diversification. To facilitate probability computation we discretize the base distribution on speciation and extinction rates into k rate categories. The fixed number of rate categories allows us to extend the theory of state-dependent speciation and extinction models (e.g., BiSSE and MuSSE) to compute the probability of an observed phylogeny given the set of speciation and extinction rates. To estimate branch-specific diversification rates, we develop two independent and theoretically equivalent approaches numerical integration with stochastic character mapping and data-augmentation with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We validate the implementation of the two approaches in RevBayes using simulated data and an empirical example study of primates. In the empirical example, we show that estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are, unsurprisingly, very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. Instead, branch-specific diversification rate estimates are less sensitive to the assumed prior distribution on the number of diversification-rate shifts and consistently infer an increased rate of diversification for Old World Monkeys. Additionally, we observe that as few as 10 diversification-rate categories are sufficient to approximate a continuous base distribution on diversification rates. In conclusion, our implementation of the lineage-specific birth-death-shift model in RevBayes provides biologists with a method to estimate branch-specific diversification rates under a mathematically consistent model.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Branch-Specific Speciation and Extinction Rates, bioRxiv, 2019-02-21","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_bayesian_approach_for_estimating_branch-specific_speciation_and_extinction_rates_55822262/"},{"date":"2019-02-21T00:00:00Z","description":"High-resolution structural information is essential to understand protein function.

Synonymous mutations had highly variable fitness effects, both deleterious and beneficial, resembling those of nonsynonymous mutations in the same gene. This variation in fitness was underlain by changes in transcription linked to the creation of internal promoter sites. A positive correlation between fitness and the presence of synonymous substitutions across a phylogeny of related Pseudomonads suggests these mutations may be common in nature.

A striking example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Through manual curation of putative loss of function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative mRNA splicing, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates this exon expression information into variant interpretation. Here, we develop a transcript-level annotation metric, the proportion expressed across transcripts (pext), which summarizes isoform quantifications for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and show that it clearly differentiates between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.4% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental disorders and intellectual disability (DDID) to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have effect sizes similar to those of synonymous variants, while pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases versus controls. Our annotation is fast, flexible, and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for rare disease diagnosis, rare variant burden analyses in complex disorders, and curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Transcript expression-aware annotation improves rare variant discovery and interpretation, bioRxiv, 2019-02-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/transcript_expression-aware_annotation_improves_rare_variant_discovery_and_interpretation_55759141/"},{"date":"2019-02-19T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYA recent article in Cell reported a new form of modified rabies virus that was apparently capable of labeling neurons “without adverse effects on neuronal physiology and circuit function”.

The constant threat of phage infection to bacterial hosts, and the imperative of achieving infection on the part of phages, drives an evolutionary contest in which phage-resistant bacteria emerge, often followed by phages with new routes of infection. This process has received abundant theoretical and experimental attention for decades and forms an important basis for molecular genetics and theoretical ecology and evolution. However, at present, we know very little about the nature of phage-bacteria interaction -- and the evolution of phage resistance -- inside the surface-bound communities that microbes usually occupy in natural environments. These communities, termed biofilms, are encased in a matrix of secreted polymers produced by their microbial residents. Biofilms are spatially constrained such that interactions become limited to neighbors or near-neighbors; diffusion of solutes and particulates is reduced; and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and therefore physiological state. These factors can dramatically impact the way phage infections proceed even in simple, single-strain biofilms, but we still know little of their effect on phage resistance evolutionary dynamics. Here we explore this problem using a computational simulation framework customized for implementing phage infection inside multi-strain biofilms. Our simulations predict that it is far easier for phage-susceptible and phage- resistant bacteria to coexist inside biofilms relative to planktonic culture, where phages and hosts are well-mixed. We characterize the negative frequency dependent selection that underlies this coexistence, and we then test and confirm this prediction using an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy at single-cell and single-phage resolution.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Evolutionary dynamics of phage resistance in bacterial biofilms, bioRxiv, 2019-02-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/evolutionary_dynamics_of_phage_resistance_in_bacterial_biofilms_55644817/"},{"date":"2019-02-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Nanopore sequencing offers a portable and affordable alternative to sequencing-by-synthesis methods but suffers from lower accuracy and cannot sequence ultra-short DNA.

These can be sequenced on the MinION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), and the resulting repeat sequences aligned to produce a highly-accurate consensus that reduces the high error-rate present in the individual repeats. Using this approach, we demonstrate for the first time the ability to obtain unbiased and accurate nanopore data for target DNA sequences of \u0026lt; 100 bp.

Additionally, we found that approximately 3% of DNMs originated following primordial germ cell specification (PGCS) in a parent, and differed from non-mosaic germline DNMs in their mutational spectra. We also discovered that nearly 10% of candidate DNMs in the second generation were post-zygotic, and present in both somatic and germ cells; these gonosomal mutations occurred at equivalent frequencies on both parental haplotypes.

In addition, it has recently emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen through the acquisition of genetic elements that confer resistance to antibiotics and virulence. We performed a whole-genome sequencing based study on 96 multidrug-resistant E. faecium strains that asymptomatically colonized five patients with the aim to describe the genome dynamics of this species. Results The patients were hospitalized on multiple occasions and isolates were collected over periods ranging from 15 months to 6.5 years. Ninety-five of the sequenced isolates belonged to E. faecium clade A1, which was previously determined to be responsible for the vast majority of clinical infections. The clade A1 strains clustered into six clonal groups of highly similar isolates, three of which entirely consisted of isolates from a single patient. We also found evidence of concurrent colonization of patients by multiple distinct lineages and transfer of strains between patients during hospitalisation. We estimated the evolutionary rate of two clonal groups that colonized a single patient at 12.6 and 25.2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)genomeyear. A detailed analysis of the accessory genome of one of the clonal groups revealed considerable variation due to gene gain and loss events, including the chromosomal acquisition of a 37 kbp prophage and the loss of an element containing carbohydrate metabolism-related genes. We determined the presence and location of twelve different Insertion Sequence (IS) elements, with ISEfa5 showing a unique pattern of location in 24 of the 25 isolates, suggesting widespread ISEfa5 excision and insertion into the genome during gut colonization. Conclusions Our findings show that the E. faecium genome is highly dynamic during asymptomatic colonization of the patient gut.

A PCR-free, shotgun metagenomics approach has greater potential for accurately quantifying species relative abundances, but applying metagenomics to eukaryotes is challenging due to low numbers of reference genomes. We have developed a pipeline, RevMet (Reverse Metagenomics), that allows reliable and semi-quantitative characterization of the species composition of mixed-species eukaryote samples, such as bee-collected pollen, without requiring reference genomes. Instead, reference species are represented only by 'genome skims' low-cost, low-coverage, shortread sequence datasets. The skims are mapped to individual long reads sequenced from mixed-species samples using the MinION, a portable nanopore sequencing device, and each long read is uniquely assigned to a plant species. We genome-skimmed 49 wild UK plant species, validated our pipeline with mock DNA mixtures of known composition, and then applied RevMet to pollen loads collected from wild bees. We demonstrate that RevMet can identify plant species present in mixed-species samples at proportions of DNA \u0026gt;1%, with few false positives and false negatives, and reliably differentiate species represented by high versus low amounts of DNA in a sample. The RevMet pipeline could readily be adapted to generate semi-quantitative datasets for a wide range of mixed eukaryote samples, which could include characterising diets, quantifying allergenic pollen from air samples, quantifying soil fauna, and identifying the compositions of algal and diatom communities.

GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures.

The regulation and integration of neuronal processing between oscillating assemblies at distinct frequencies, and thereby the coordination of distinct computational functions, is thought to be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Although many studies have observed CFC locally within a brain region during cognitive processing, the large-scale networks of CFC have remained largely uncharted. Critically, also the validity of prior CFC observations and the presence of true neuronal CFC has been recently questioned because non-sinusoidal or non-zero-mean waveforms that are commonplace in electrophysiological data cause filtering artefacts that lead to false positive CFC findings. We used a unique dataset of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to chart whole-brain CFC networks from human resting-state brain dynamics. Using a novel graph theoretical method to distinguish true inter-areal CFC from potentially false positive CFC, we show that the resting state is characterized by two separable forms of true inter-areal CFC phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and nm-cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). PAC and CFS large-scale networks coupled prefrontal, visual and sensorimotor cortices, but with opposing anatomical architectures. Crucially also directionalities between low- and high-frequency oscillations were opposite between CFS and PAC. We also found CFC to decay as a function of distance and to be stronger in the superficial than deep layers of the cortex. In conclusion, these results provide conclusive evidence for the presence of two forms of genuine inter-areal CFC and elucidate the large-scale organization of CFC resting-state networks.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Resting-state cross-frequency coupling networks in human electrophysiological recordings, bioRxiv, 2019-02-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/resting-state_cross-frequency_coupling_networks_in_human_electrophysiological_recordings_55400952/"},{"date":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Many bacteria interact with target organisms using syringe-like structures called Contractile Injection Systems (CIS). CIS structurally resemble headless bacteriophages and share evolutionarily related proteins such as the tail tube, sheath, and baseplate complex. Recent evidence shows that CIS are specialized to puncture membranes and often deliver effectors to target cells. In many cases, CIS mediate trans-kingdom interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes, however the effectors delivered to target cells and their mode of action are often unknown. In this work, we establish an in vitro model to study a CIS called Metamorphosis Associated Contractile structures (MACs) that target eukaryotic cells. We show that MACs kill two eukaryotic cell lines, Fall Armyworm Sf9 cells and J774A.1 murine macrophage cells through the action of a newly identified MAC effector, termed Pne1. To our knowledge, Pne1 is the first CIS effector exhibiting nuclease activity against eukaryotic cells. Our results define a new mechanism of CIS-mediated bacteria-eukaryote interaction and are a first step toward understanding structures with the potential to be developed as novel delivery systems for eukaryotic hosts.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Bacterial Phage Tail-like Structure Kills Eukaryotic Cells by Injecting a Nuclease Effector, bioRxiv, 2019-02-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/bacterial_phage_tail-like_structure_kills_eukaryotic_cells_by_injecting_a_nuclease_effector_55318539/"},{"date":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Endurance exercise begun with reduced muscle glycogen stores seems to potentiate skeletal muscle protein abundance and gene expression. However, it is unknown whether this greater signalling responses is due to low muscle glycogen per se or to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity - as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle glycogen stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle glycogen-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle glycogen in both approaches but was performed either two or 15 h after the first exercise session (so-called twice-a-day and once-daily approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1a), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa;) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor betadelta (PPARbd) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that the elevated molecular signalling reported with previous train-low approaches can be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity rather than the reduced muscle glycogen content per se.

Compared to other budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, we noticed that a lineage in the genus Hanseniaspora exhibited very high evolutionary rates, low GC content, small genome sizes, and lower gene numbers. To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution, we analyzed 25 genomes, including 11 newly sequenced, representing 18  21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two Hanseniaspora lineages, the fast-evolving lineage (FEL), which began diversifying ~87 million years ago (mya), and the slow-evolving lineage (SEL), which began diversifying ~54 mya. Remarkably, both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity, but these losses were greater in the FEL. For example, all species lost the cell cycle regulator WHI5, and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g., MAD1, MAD2) and DNA damage checkpoint pathway (e.g., MEC3, RAD9). Similarly, both lineages lost genes involved in DNA repair pathways, including the DNA glycosylase gene MAG1, which is part of the base excision repair pathway, and the DNA photolyase gene PHR1, which is involved in pyrimidine dimer repair. Strikingly, the FEL lost 33 additional genes, including polymerases (i.e., POL4 and POL32) and telomere-associated genes (e.g., RIF1, RFA3, CDC13, PBP2). Echoing these losses, molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that, compared to the SEL, the FEL stem lineage underwent a burst of accelerated evolution, which resulted in greater mutational loads, homopolymer instabilities, and higher fractions of mutations associated with the common endogenously damaged base, 8-oxoguanine. We conclude that Hanseniaspora is an ancient lineage that has diversified and thrived, despite lacking many otherwise highly conserved cell cycle and genome integrity genes and pathways, and may represent a novel system for studying cellular life without them.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Extensive loss of cell cycle and DNA repair genes in an ancient lineage of bipolar budding yeasts, bioRxiv, 2019-02-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/extensive_loss_of_cell_cycle_and_dna_repair_genes_in_an_ancient_lineage_of_bipolar_budding_yeasts_55315095/"},{"date":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Although mRNAs are key molecules for understanding life, there exists no method to determine the full-length sequence of endogenous mRNAs including their poly(A) tails.

Brief perturbations of visuomotor feedback triggered distinct changes in swimming behavior and different neuronal responses. Neuronal activity reflecting sensorimotor mismatch, rather than sensory input or motor output alone, was prominent throughout multiple forebrain areas.

The strong influence of the tissue structure has been convincingly demonstrated in intestinal cancers where adenomas grow by the fission of stem-cell-maintained glands influenced by early expression of abnormal cell mobility in cancer progenitors2, 3. So-called “born to be bad” tumors arise from progenitors which may already possess the necessary driver mutations for malignancy4, 5 and metastasis6. These tumors subsequently evolve neutrally, thereby maximizing intratumoral heterogeneity and increasing the probability of therapeutic resistance. These findings have been nuanced by the advent of multi-region sequencing, which uses spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation among competing tumor cell populations to shed light on the mode of tumor evolution (neutral or Darwinian) and also the tempo4, 7–11. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model12–16) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This model approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity competition for space. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects.

Improving consensus sequences (‘polishing’) with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but prepolish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.ConclusionsBasecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last two years. The current version of ONT’s Guppy basecaller performs well overall, with good accuracy and fast performance. If higher accuracy is required, users should consider producing a custom model using a larger neural network andor training data from the same species.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Performance of neural network basecalling tools for Oxford Nanopore sequencing, bioRxiv, 2019-02-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/performance_of_neural_network_basecalling_tools_for_oxford_nanopore_sequencing_55111957/"},{"date":"2019-02-07T00:00:00Z","description":"F1Fo-ATP synthases play a central role in cellular metabolism, making the energy of the proton-motive force across a membrane available for a large number of energy-consuming processes. We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 Å resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30° of each 120° primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ringa-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases. We identify the previously unknown ASA10 subunit and present complete de novo atomic models of subunits ASA1-10, which make up the two interlinked peripheral stalks that stabilize the Polytomella ATP synthase dimer.","tags":["biorxiv","biochemistry","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Rotary substates of mitochondrial ATP synthase reveal the basis of flexible F1-Fo coupling, bioRxiv, 2019-02-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rotary_substates_of_mitochondrial_atp_synthase_reveal_the_basis_of_flexible_f1-fo_coupling_55066825/"},{"date":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","description":"The genome versus experience, or Nature versus Nurture, debate has dominated our understanding of individual behavioral variation.

Conversely, little is known about the mechanisms that control the end of the reproductive phase (floral arrest), despite this being a critical process for optimising fruit and seed production. Complete fruit removal or lack of fertile fruit-set in male sterile mutants, for example male sterile1 (ms1), prevents timely floral arrest in the model plant Arabidopsis. These observations formed the basis for Hensel and colleagues model in which end-of-flowering was proposed to result from a cumulative fruitseed-derived signal that caused simultaneous global proliferative arrest (GPA) in all inflorescences. Recent studies have suggested that end-of-flowering involves gene expression changes at the floral meristem which are at least in part controlled by the FRUITFULL-APETELA2 pathway, however there is limited understanding of how this process is controlled and the communication needed at the whole plant level. Here, we provide new information providing a framework for the fruit-to-meristem (F-M) communication implied by the GPA model. We show that floral arrest in Arabidopsis is not global and does not occur synchronously between branches, but rather that the arrest of each inflorescence is a local process, driven by auxin export from fruit proximal to the inflorescence meristem (IM). Furthermore, we show that inflorescence meristems are only competent for floral arrest once they reach a certain developmental age. Understanding the regulation of floral arrest is of major importance for the future manipulation of flowering to extend and maximise crop yields.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Auxin export from proximal fruits drives arrest in competent inflorescence meristems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/auxin_export_from_proximal_fruits_drives_arrest_in_competent_inflorescence_meristems_55042090/"},{"date":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","description":"Effective vaccines inducing lifelong protection against many important infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are not yet available despite decades of research.

The engineered antibodies were expressed in up to 59% of primary B cells under the control of endogenous regulatory elements, which maintained normal antibody expression and secretion. Importantly, a single transfer of murine B cells engineered to express an antibody protective against RSV resulted in potent and durable protection against RSV infection in immunocompromised hosts.

During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microbes) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a dynamic fashion with early members opening metabolic niches for the followers. Through large-scale mapping of metabolic preferences and inter-species interactions, we show how microbes poorly suited for milk survive in, and even dominate the community through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between the grain and the liquid phase.

Here, we present self-reporting transposons (SRTs) and their use in single cell calling cards (scCC), a novel assay for simultaneously capturing gene expression profiles and mapping TF binding sites in single cells. First, we show how the genomic locations of SRTs can be recovered from mRNA. Next, we demonstrate that SRTs deposited by the piggyBac transposase can be used to map the genome-wide localization of the TFs SP1, through a direct fusion of the two proteins, and BRD4, through its native affinity for piggyBac. We then present the scCC method, which maps SRTs from scRNA-seq libraries, thus enabling concomitant identification of cell types and TF binding sites in those same cells. As a proof-of-concept, we show recovery of cell type-specific BRD4 and SP1 binding sites from cultured cells. Finally, we map Brd4 binding sites in the mouse cortex at single cell resolution, thus establishing a new technique for studying TF biology in situ.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Self-reporting transposons enable simultaneous readout of gene expression and transcription factor binding in single cells, bioRxiv, 2019-02-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/self-reporting_transposons_enable_simultaneous_readout_of_gene_expression_and_transcription_factor_binding_in_single_cells_54834788/"},{"date":"2019-02-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMotivationSynapses are essential to neural signal transmission. Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synaptic punctum imaging data, several issues are impeding satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synaptic puncta is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio due to constraints of experiment facilities and availability of sensitive antibodies. These issues make the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to easily and accurately quantify synapses.ResultsWe present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. SynQuant is unsupervised, works for both 2D and 3D data, and can handle multiple staining channels. Through extensive experiments on one synthetic and three real data sets with ground truth annotation or manual labeling, SynQuant was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods, including 4 unsupervised and 11 variants of 3 supervised methods.AvailabilityJava source code, Fiji plug-in, and test data available at \u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comyu-lab-vtSynQuant\u003ehttpsgithub.comyu-lab-vtSynQuant\u003cjatsext-link\u003e.Contactyug@vt.edu","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"SynQuant An Automatic Tool to Quantify Synapses from Microscopy Images, bioRxiv, 2019-02-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/synquant_an_automatic_tool_to_quantify_synapses_from_microscopy_images_54857304/"},{"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractInformation within the brain travels from neuron to neuron across billions of synapses. At any given moment, only a small subset of neurons and synapses are active, but finding the active synapses in brain tissue has been a technical challenge. To tag active synapses in a user-defined time window, we developed SynTagMA. Upon 405 nm illumination, this genetically encoded marker of activity converts from green to red fluorescence if, and only if, it is bound to calcium. Targeted to presynaptic terminals, preSynTagMA allows discrimination between active and silent axons. Targeted to excitatory postsynapses, postSynTagMA creates a snapshot of synapses active just before photoconversion. To analyze large datasets, we developed software to identify and track the fluorescence of thousands of individual synapses in tissue. Together, these tools provide a high throughput method for repeatedly mapping active neurons and synapses in cell culture, slice preparations, and in vivo during behavior.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Freeze-frame imaging of synaptic activity using SynTagMA, bioRxiv, 2019-02-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/freeze-frame_imaging_of_synaptic_activity_using_syntagma_54819656/"},{"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Reconquista","tags":["nature communications","genetics","500+-users","2019"],"title":"Patterns of genetic differentiation and the footprints of historical migrations in the Iberian Peninsula, Nature Communications, 2019-02-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/patterns_of_genetic_differentiation_and_the_footprints_of_historical_migrations_in_the_iberian_peninsula_54801340/"},{"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Disease is both among the most important selection pressures in nature and among the main causes of yield loss in agriculture.

These proteins function as intracellular immune receptors that recognize pathogen proteins and their effects on the plant. Consistent with evolutionarily dynamic interactions between plants and pathogens, NLRs are known to be encoded by one of the most variable gene families in plants, but the true extent of intraspecific NLR diversity has been unclear. Here, we define the majority of the Arabidopsis thaliana species-wide 'NLRome'. From NLR sequence enrichment and long-read sequencing of 65 diverse A. thaliana accessions, we infer that the pan-NLRome saturates with approximately 40 accessions. Despite the high diversity of NLRs, half of the pan-NLRome is present in most accessions. We chart the architectural diversity of NLR proteins, identify novel architectures, and quantify the selective forces that act on specific NLRs, domains, and positions.

Here, we develop an approach to use data from many phenotypic traits simultaneously to identify causal genetic loci. Using data for 260 traits scored across a maize diversity panel, we demonstrate that a distinct set of genes are identified relative to conventional genome wide association. The genes identified using this many-trait approach are more likely to be independently validated than the genes identified by conventional analysis of the same dataset. Genes identified by the new many-trait approach share a number of molecular, population genetic, and evolutionary features with a gold standard set of genes characterized through forward genetics. These features, as well as substantially stronger functional enrichment and purification, separate them from both genes identified by conventional genome wide association and from the overall population of annotated gene models.

Large-scale DNA sequencing studies have created a catalogue of naturally occurring genetic variants predicted to cause loss of function in human genes, which in principle should provide powerful in vivo models of human genetic “knockouts” to complement model organism knockout studies and inform drug development. Here, we consider the use of predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variation catalogued in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) for the evaluation of genes as potential drug targets. Many drug targets, including the targets of highly successful inhibitors such as aspirin and statins, are under natural selection at least as extreme as known haploinsufficient genes, with pLoF variants almost completely depleted from the population. Thus, metrics of gene essentiality should not be used to eliminate genes from consideration as potential targets. The identification of individual humans harboring “knockouts” (biallelic gene inactivation), followed by individual recall and deep phenotyping, is highly valuable to study gene function. In most genes, pLoF alleles are sufficiently rare that ascertainment will be largely limited to heterozygous individuals in outbred populations. Sampling of diverse bottlenecked populations and consanguineous individuals will aid in identification of total “knockouts”. Careful filtering and curation of pLoF variants in a gene of interest is necessary in order to identify true LoF individuals for follow-up, and the positional distribution or frequency of true LoF variants may reveal important disease biology. Our analysis suggests that the value of pLoF variant data for drug discovery lies in deep curation informed by the nature of the drug and its indication, as well as the biology of the gene, followed by recall-by-genotype studies in targeted populations.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Evaluating potential drug targets through human loss-of-function genetic variation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/evaluating_potential_drug_targets_through_human_loss-of-function_genetic_variation_54627010/"},{"date":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Background With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these methods.

Together, CRISPRi-FlowFISH and the ABC model provide a systematic approach to map and predict which enhancers regulate which genes, and will help to interpret the functions of the thousands of disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Activity-by-Contact model of enhancer specificity from thousands of CRISPR perturbations, bioRxiv, 2019-01-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/activity-by-contact_model_of_enhancer_specificity_from_thousands_of_crispr_perturbations_54544414/"},{"date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","description":"Illumina sequencing allows rapid, cheap and accurate whole genome bacterial analyses, but short reads (\u0026lt;300 bp) do not usually enable complete genome assembly. Long read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly); however, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods impact on assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or from SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies. Both strategies facilitate high-quality genome reconstruction. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Comparison of long-read sequencing technologies in the hybrid assembly of complex bacterial genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-01-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/comparison_of_long-read_sequencing_technologies_in_the_hybrid_assembly_of_complex_bacterial_genomes_54544955/"},{"date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","description":"Existing long-read assemblers require tens of thousands of CPU hours to assemble a human genome and are being outpaced by sequencing technologies in terms of both throughput and cost.

In both real and simulated EEG data, we show that spurious decoding may emerge with filter cut-off settings from as modest as 0.1 Hz. We provide an alternative method of removing slow drift noise, referred to as robust detrending (de Cheveigne \u0026amp; Arzounian, 2018), which, when applied in concert with masking of cortical events does not result in the temporal displacement of information. We show that temporal generalization may benefit from robust detrending, without any of the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering.

These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran’s Q-test (Phet).A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet=1.4×10-5).

Still, the causal effects of obesity on other leading causes of death is relatively unexplored. It is also unclear if any such effects differ between men and women.Mendelian randomization is a method that explores causal relationships between traits using genetic data. Using Mendelian randomization, we investigated the effects of obesity traits on leading causes of death and assessed if any such effects differ between men and women.We found that obesity increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic liver disease. Higher body mass index led to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men, whereas a higher waist-hip ratio increased risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease more in men than in women.In summary, obesity traits are causally involved in the majority of the leading causes of death, and some obesity traits affect disease risk differently in men and women. This has potential implications for public health strategies and indicates that sex-specific preventative measure may be needed.AbbreviationsBMI, Body mass index; CAD coronary artery disease; CLD, chronic liver disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; FG, fasting glucose; FI, fasting insulin; GIANT, Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits; GRS, genetic risk score; GWAS, genomewide association study; MAGIC, the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium; MR, Mendelian randomization; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; OR, odds ratio; T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SD, standard deviation; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; WHO, the World Health Organization; WHR, waist-hip-ratio; WHRadjBMI, waist-hip-ratio adjusted for body mass index.","tags":["biorxiv","epidemiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men, bioRxiv, 2019-01-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/causal_relationships_between_obesity_and_the_leading_causes_of_death_in_women_and_men_54531769/"},{"date":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundObesity traits are causally implicated with risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

The mechanisms linking obesity and T2D to cancer have not been established, preventing targeted interventions. Arguments have been made that hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, or inflammation could drive cancer initiation andor progression. Hyperinsulinemia is a cardinal feature of obesity and T2D, and is independently associated with PDAC incidence and mortality, even in non-obese people. Despite ample human epidemiological evidence linking hyperinsulinemia to PDAC, there is no direct in vivo evidence of a causal role for endogenous insulin in cancer in any system. Using mice with reduced insulin gene dosage, we show here that a modest reduction in endogenous insulin production leads to a ~50% reduction in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pre-cancerous lesions in high fat diet-fed mice expressing the KrasG12D oncogene. The significant reduction in PanIN lesions occurred in the absence of changes in fasting glucose. Reduced insulin also led to a ~50% reduction in pancreatic fibrosis, suggesting that endogenous insulin drives PanIN development, in part, via its pro-fibrotic effects on the stroma surrounding acinar cells and PanIN. Collectively, our data indicate that endogenous insulin hypersecretion contributes causally to pancreatic cancer development. This suggests a modest reduction in fasting insulin via lifestyle interventions or therapeutics may be useful in cancer prevention.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Endogenous insulin contributes to pancreatic cancer development, bioRxiv, 2019-01-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/endogenous_insulin_contributes_to_pancreatic_cancer_development_54463404/"},{"date":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","description":"The function of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in the organization of the genome has become an important area of investigation, but the mechanisms of how CTCF dynamically contributes to genome organization is not clear.

We find that behavioral interactions are generally important in setting elevational range limits and preventing coexistence of closely related species. Specifically, close relatives that defend year-round territories tend to live in non-overlapping elevational distributions, while close relatives that do not defend territories tend to broadly overlap in distribution. In contrast, neither similarity in beak morphology nor evolutionary relatedness was associated with patterns of range limitation.

Whether conduit integrity and filtering functions are affected during cycles of LN expansion and resolution is not known. Here we show that the conduit structure is disrupted during acute LN expansion but FRC-FRC contacts remain intact. In homeostasis, polarised FRCs adhere to the underlying substrate to deposit ECM ba-solaterally. ECM production by FRCs is regulated by the C-type lectin CLEC-2, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs), at transcriptional and secretory levels. Inflamed LNs maintain conduit size-exclusion, but flow becomes leaky, which allows soluble antigens to reach more antigen-presenting cells.

Here, we demonstrate a de novo approach to identify mobile elements from short-read sequencing data. The method identifies the precise site of mobile element insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. This is an improvement over previous methods that either rely on curated databases of known mobile elements or rely on 'split-read' alignments that assume the inserted element exists within the reference genome. We apply our approach to 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine prevalent bacterial pathogens, and we identify hundreds of known and novel mobile genetic elements, including many candidate insertion sequences. We find that the mobile element repertoire and insertion rate vary considerably across species, and that many of the identified mobile elements are biased toward certain target sequences, several of them being highly specific. Mobile element insertion hotspots often cluster near genes involved in mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and such insertions are associated with antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Finally, we demonstrate that mutagenesis caused by these mobile elements contributes to antibiotic resistance in a genome-wide association study of mobile element insertions in pathogenic Escherichia coli. In summary, by applying a de novo approach to precisely identify mobile genetic elements and their insertion sites, we thoroughly characterize the mobile element repertoire and insertion spectrum of nine pathogenic bacterial species and find that mobile element insertions play a significant role in the evolution of clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Mobile genetic element insertions drive antibiotic resistance across pathogens, bioRxiv, 2019-01-24","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/mobile_genetic_element_insertions_drive_antibiotic_resistance_across_pathogens_54409093/"},{"date":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","description":"Large reservoirs of natural gas in the oceanic subsurface sustain a complex biosphere of anaerobic microbes, including recently characterized archaeal lineages that extend the potential to mediate hydrocarbon oxidation (methane and butane) beyond the Methanomicrobia.

We reconstructed Helarchaeota genomes from hydrothermal deep-sea sediment metagenomes in hydrocarbon-rich Guaymas Basin, and show that these encode novel methyl-CoM reductase-like enzymes that are similar to those found in butane-oxidizing archaea. Based on these results as well as the presence of several alkyl-CoA oxidation and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway genes in the Helarchaeota genomes, we suggest that members of the Helarchaeota have the potential to activate and subsequently anaerobically oxidize short-chain hydrocarbons.

Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) is defined as the coordinated polarity of cells within a tissue axis and is essential for processes such as gastrulation, neural tube closure or hearing. Wnt ligands can be instructive or permissive during PCP-dependent processes, and Wnt pathway mutants are often classified as PCP mutants due to the complexity and the similarities between their phenotypes. Our studies of the zebrafish sensory lateral line reveal that disruptions of the PCP and Wnt pathways have differential effects on hair cell orientations. While mutations in PCP genes cause random orientations of hair cells, mutations in Wnt pathway members induce hair cells to adopt a concentric pattern. We show that PCP signaling is normal in hair cells of Wnt pathway mutants and that the concentric hair cell phenotype is due to altered organization of the surrounding support cells. Thus, the PCP and Wnt pathways work in parallel, as separate pathways to establish proper hair cell orientation. Our data suggest that coordinated support cell organization is established during the formation of lateral line primordia, much earlier than the appearance of hair cells. Together, these finding reveal that hair cell orientation defects are not solely explained by defects in PCP signaling and that some hair cell phenotypes warrant reevaluation.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Parallel control of mechanosensory hair cell orientation by the PCP and Wnt pathways, bioRxiv, 2019-01-24","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/parallel_control_of_mechanosensory_hair_cell_orientation_by_the_pcp_and_wnt_pathways_54413002/"},{"date":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","description":"1.Executive SummaryThis survey and data analysis were conducted by the European Network of Postdoctoral Associations (ENPA) with the aim of assessing the current research and work conditions, aspirations and support received by postdoctoral researchers working in Europe.The Results section is structured into three main parts.

However, most of our understanding of this critical architecture has been limited to the gene-rich euchromatin, and largely ignores the gene-poor and repeat-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin, or PCH. PCH comprises large part of most eukaryotic genomes, forms 3D PCH domains in nuclei, and plays vital role in chromosome dynamics and genome stability. In this study, we developed a new method that overcomes the technical challenges imposed by the highly repetitive PCH DNA, and generated a comprehensive picture of its 3D organization. Combined with image analyses, we revealed a hierarchical organization of the PCH domains. Surprisingly, we showed that distant euchromatic regions enriched for repressive epigenetic marks also dynamically interact with the main PCH domains. These 3D interactions are mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation mechanisms, similar to how oil and vinegar separate in salad dressing, and can influence the fitness of individuals.

Overproduction of oxalate occurs in the liver due to an inherited genetic defect in the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT), causing pathology due to the insolubility of calcium oxalate crystals in body fluids. The main current therapy is dual liver-kidney transplant, which incurs high morbidity and has poor availability in some health systems where PH1 is more prevalent. One approach currently in active clinical investigation targets HAO1 (hydroxyacid oxidase 1), encoding glycolate oxidase, to reduce substrate levels for oxalate production. To inform drug development, we sought individuals with reduced HAO1 function due to naturally occurring genetic variation. Analysis of loss of function variants in 141,456 sequenced individuals suggested individuals with complete HAO1 knockout would only be observed in 1 in 30 million outbred people. However in a large sequencing and health records program (Genes \u0026amp; Health), in populations with substantial autozygosity, we identified a healthy adult individual predicted to have complete knockout of HAO1 due to an ultra rare homozygous frameshift variant (rs1186715161, ENSP00000368066.3p.Leu333SerfsTer4). Primary care and hospital health records confirmed no apparently related clinical phenotype. At recall, urine and plasma oxalate levels were normal, however plasma glycolate levels (171 nmolmL) were 12 times the upper limit of normal in healthy, reference individuals (mean+2sd=14 nmolmL, n=67) while her urinary glycolate levels were 6 times the upper limit of normal. Comparison with preclinical and phase 1 clinical trial data of an RNAi therapeutic targeting HAO1 (lumasiran) suggests the individual likely retains \u0026lt;2% residual glycolate oxidase activity. These results provide important data to support the safety of HAO1 inhibition as a potential chronic therapy for a devastating metabolic disease (PH1). We also suggest that the effect of glycolate oxidase suppression in any potential other roles in humans beyond glycolate oxidation do not lead to clinical phenotypes, at least in this specific individual. This demonstrates the value of studying the lifelong complete knockdown of a target protein in a living human to aid development of a potential therapeutic, both in de-risking the approach and providing potential hypotheses to optimize its development. Furthermore, therapy for PH1 is likely to be required lifelong, in contrast to data from chronicity studies in non-human species or relatively short-term therapeutic studies in people.

We also observed this effect in an independent screen fine-mapping the core motifs in enhancers of the GATA1 gene. We then conducted screens in parallel with CRISPRi and CRISPRa, which do not induce DNA damage, and found that an unexpected and distinct set of off-targets also caused strong confounding growth effects with these epigenome-editing platforms. Promisingly, strict filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and allowed for the identification of essential enhancers, which we validated extensively.

The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, where ~146 base pair increments of the genome are wrapped and compacted around the core histone proteins. Further genomic organization and compaction occur through higher order assembly of nucleosomes. This organization regulates many nuclear processes, and is controlled in part by histone post-transtranslational modifications and chromatin-binding proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the assembly and compaction of the genome remain unclear. Here we show that in the presence of physiologic concentrations of mono- and divalent salts, histone tail-driven interactions drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of nucleosome arrays, resulting in substantial condensation. Phase separation of nucleosomal arrays is inhibited by histone acetylation, whereas histone H1 promotes phase separation, further compaction, and decreased dynamics within droplets, mirroring the relationship between these modulators and the accessibility of the genome in cells. These results indicate that under physiologically relevant conditions, LLPS is an intrinsic behavior of the chromatin polymer, and suggest a model in which the condensed phase reflects a genomic 'ground state' that can produce chromatin organization and compaction in vivo. The dynamic nature of this state could enable known modulators of chromatin structure, such as post-translational modifications and chromatin binding proteins, to act upon it and consequently control nuclear processes such as transcription and DNA repair. Our data suggest an important role for LLPS of chromatin in the organization of the eukaryotic genome.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Organization and Regulation of Chromatin by Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/organization_and_regulation_of_chromatin_by_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_54101027/"},{"date":"2019-01-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Transposable elements are abundant genetic components of eukaryotic genomes with important regulatory features affecting transcription, splicing, and recombination, among others.

By generating Hi-C data in 2-cell-like cells, we show that MERLV elements promote the formation of insulating domain boundaries throughout the genome in vivo and in vitro. The formation of these boundaries is coupled to the upregulation of directional transcription from MERVL, which results in the activation of a subset of the gene expression programme of the 2-cell stage embryo. Domain boundaries in the 2-cell stage embryo are transient and can be remodelled without undergoing cell division. Remarkably, we find extensive inter-strain MERVL variation, suggesting multiple non-overlapping rounds of recent genome invasion and a high regulatory plasticity of genome organisation. Our results demonstrate that MERVL drive chromatin organisation during early embryonic development shedding light into how nuclear organisation emerges during zygotic genome activation in mammals.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Transposable elements drive reorganisation of 3D chromatin during early embryogenesis, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/transposable_elements_drive_reorganisation_of_3d_chromatin_during_early_embryogenesis_54065240/"},{"date":"2019-01-17T00:00:00Z","description":"The centrifuge is an essential tool for many aspects of research and medical diagnostics.

Here, we utilize a human norovirus replicon in human gastric tumor (HGT) cells to identify host factors involved in promoting or inhibiting HuNoV replication. We observed that an IFN-cured population of replicon-harboring HGT cells (HGT-cured) was enhanced in their ability to replicate transfected HuNoV RNA compared to parental HGT cells, suggesting that differential gene expression in HGT-cured cells created an environment favouring norovirus replication. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially regulated in HGT-NV and HGT-cured compared to parental HGT cells. We found that the IFN lambda receptor alpha (IFNLR1) expression was highly reduced in HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells. All three cell lines responded to exogenous IFN-β by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), however, HGT-NV and HGT-cured failed to respond to exogenous IFN-λ. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially reactivated IFNLR1 expression in HGT-NV and IFN-cured cells suggesting that host adaptation occurred via epigenetic reprogramming. In line with this, ectopic expression of the IFN-λ receptor alpha rescued HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells response to IFN-λ. We conclude that type III IFN is important in inhibiting HuNoV replication in vitro and that the loss of IFNLR1 enhances replication of HuNoV.

Here, we analyse a global dataset of killer whale genomes in a rare attempt to elucidate global population structure in a non-human species. We identify a pattern of genetic homogenisation at lower latitudes and the greatest differentiation at high latitudes, even between currently sympatric lineages. The processes underlying the major axis of structure include high drift at the edge of species' range, likely associated with founder effects and allelic surfing during post-glacial range expansion. Divergence between Antarctic and non-Antarctic lineages is further driven by ancestry segments with up to four-fold older coalescence time than the genome-wide average; relicts of a previous vicariance during an earlier glacial cycle. Our study further underpins that episodic gene flow is ubiquitous in natural populations, and can occur across great distances and after substantial periods of isolation between populations.

Other approaches utilize alignments to a reference genome for ordering and orienting, however these tools rely on slow aligners and are not robust to repetitive contigs.Results We present RaGOO, an open-source reference-guided contig ordering and orienting tool that leverages the speed and sensitivity of Minimap2 to accurately achieve chromosome-scale assemblies in just minutes. With the pseudomolecules constructed, RaGOO identifies structural variants, including those spanning sequencing gaps that are not reported by alternative methods. We show that RaGOO accurately orders and orients contigs into nearly complete chromosomes based on de novo assemblies of Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing from three wild and domesticated tomato genotypes, including the widely used M82 reference cultivar.

Recent studies employing single cell RNA-sequencing have identified major transcriptional changes associated with germ layer specification. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different epigenetic layers is unclear. Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Single cell multi-omics profiling reveals a hierarchical epigenetic landscape during mammalian germ layer specification Supplementary Figures, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/single_cell_multi-omics_profiling_reveals_a_hierarchical_epigenetic_landscape_during_mammalian_germ_layer_specification_supplementary_figures_53889608/"},{"date":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","description":"BrieflyAnalysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data from mouse neocortex exposes evidence for local neuropeptidergic modulation networks that involve every cortical neuron directly.Data Highlights\u003cjatslist list-type=bullet\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eAt least 98% of mouse neocortical neurons express one or more of 18 neuropeptide precursor proteins (NPP) genes.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eAt least 98% of cortical neurons express one or more of 29 neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eNeocortical expression of these 18 NPP and 29 NP-GPCR genes is highly neuron-type-specific and permits exceptionally powerful differentiation of transcriptomic neuron types.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eNeuron-type-specific expression of 37 cognate NPP  NP-GPCR gene pairs predicts modulatory connectivity within 37 or more neuron-type-specific intracortical networks.\u003cjatslist-item\u003eSummarySeeking insight into homeostasis, modulation and plasticity of cortical synaptic networks, we analyzed results from deep RNA-Seq analysis of 22,439 individual mouse neocortical neurons.

Furthermore, obesity results in a loss of the insulin receptor-mediated increases and a reduction in NAc insulin receptor surface expression, while preserving reductions in excitatory transmission mediated by IGF receptors. These results provide the first insights into how insulin influences excitatory transmission in the adult brain and have broad implications for the regulation of motivation and reward related processes by peripheral hormones.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Insulin enhances presynaptic glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens via opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/insulin_enhances_presynaptic_glutamate_release_in_the_nucleus_accumbens_via_opioid_receptor-mediated_disinhibition_53825585/"},{"date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Isogenic laboratory mouse strains are used to enhance reproducibility as individuals within a strain are essentially genetically identical. For the most widely used isogenic strain, C57BL6, there is also a wealth of genetic, phenotypic, and genomic data, including one of the highest quality reference genomes (GRCm38.p6). However, laboratory mouse strains are living reagents and hence genetic drift occurs and is an unavoidable source of accumulating genetic variability that can have an impact on reproducibility over time. Nearly 20 years after the first release of the mouse reference genome, individuals from the strain it represents (C57BL6J) are at least 26 inbreeding generations removed from the individuals used to generate the mouse reference genome. Moreover, C57BL6J is now maintained through the periodic reintroduction of mice from cryopreserved embryo stocks that are derived from a single breeder pair, aptly named C57BL6J Adam and Eve. To more accurately represent the genome of today's C57BL6J mice, we have generated a de novo assembly of the C57BL6J Eve genome (B6Eve) using high coverage, long-read sequencing, optical mapping, and short-read data. Using these data, we addressed recurring variants observed in previous mouse studies. We have also identified structural variations that impact coding sequences, closed gaps in the mouse reference assembly, some of which are in genes, and we have identified previously unannotated coding sequences through long read sequencing of cDNAs. This B6Eve assembly explains discrepant observations that have been associated with GRCm38-based analyses, and has provided data towards a reference genome that is more representative of the C57BL6J mice that are in use today.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The genome of C57BL6J Eve, the mother of the laboratory mouse genome reference strain, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_genome_of_c57bl6j_eve_the_mother_of_the_laboratory_mouse_genome_reference_strain_53827745/"},{"date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Chromatin structure has a major influence on the cell-specific density of somatic mutations along the cancer genome.

We found that, in almost all cancer types, the cell-of-origin can be predicted solely from their DNA sequences. Our analysis validated the hypothesis that high-grade serous ovarian cancer originates in the fallopian tube and identified distinct origins of breast cancer subtypes. We also demonstrated that the technique is equally capable of identifying the cell-of-origin for a series of 2,044 metastatic samples from 22 of the tumor types available as primaries. Moreover, cancer drivers, whether inherited or acquired, reside in active chromatin regions in the respective cell-of-origin. Taken together, our findings highlight that many somatic mutations accumulate while the chromatin structure of the cell-of-origin is maintained and that this historical record, captured in the DNA, can be used to identify the often elusive cancer cell-of-origin.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Tumor mutational landscape is a record of the pre-malignant state, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/tumor_mutational_landscape_is_a_record_of_the_pre-malignant_state_53825547/"},{"date":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"Chloroplasts are light harvesting organelles that arose from ancient endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.

Outer envelope protein, chloroplast unusual positioning1 (CHUP1), anchors chloroplasts to the host-pathogen interface. Stromules are induced during infection in a CHUP1-dependent manner, embracing haustoria and interconnecting chloroplasts, to form dynamic organelle clusters. Infection-triggered reprogramming of chloroplasts relies on surface immune signalling, whereas pathogen effectors subvert these immune pulses.

The theory supposes the emergence and fixation of a single mutant (capable of the syntactic operation Merge) during a narrow historical window as a result of frequency-independent selection under a huge fitness advantage in a population of an effective size that is standardly assumed to have been no larger than ~15 000 early humans. We examine this proposal by combining diffusion analysis and extreme value theory to derive a probabilistic formulation of its dynamics. Perhaps counter-intuitively, a macro-mutation is much more unlikely a priori than multiple mutations with smaller fitness effects, yet both hypotheses predict fixation with high conditional probability. The consequences of this asymmetry have not been accounted for previously.

Therefore, we hypothesize that removing common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals that are shared across participants would improve behavioral prediction. Here, we considered 803 participants from the human connectome project (HCP) with four rs-fMRI runs. We applied the common and orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) technique to decompose each HCP run into two subspaces a common (group-level) subspace shared across all participants and a subject-specific subspace. We found that the first common COBE component of the first HCP run was localized to the visual cortex and was unique to the run. On the other hand, the second common COBE component of the first HCP run and the first common COBE component of the remaining HCP runs were highly similar and localized to regions within the default network, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Overall, this suggests the presence of run-specific (state-specific) effects that were shared across participants. By removing the first and second common COBE components from the first HCP run, and the first common COBE component from the remaining HCP runs, the resulting RSFC improves behavioral prediction by an average of 11.7% across 58 behavioral measures spanning cognition, emotion and personality.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Individual-Specific fMRI-Subspaces Improve Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior Supplemental, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/individual-specific_fmri-subspaces_improve_functional_connectivity_prediction_of_behavior_supplemental_53717163/"},{"date":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"The brain constructs distributed representations of key low-dimensional variables.

Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on “amygdala activity” does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as “model degrees of freedom.” From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the ‘replicated’ findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the ‘original’ findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings. Techniques reviewed here include permutation tests on peak distance, Bayesian MANOVA, and a priori multivariate pattern-based models. These practices will help researchers to establish precise and falsifiable spatial hypotheses, promoting a cumulative science of neuroimaging.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"False-positive neuroimaging Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding, bioRxiv, 2019-01-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/false-positive_neuroimaging_undisclosed_flexibility_in_testing_spatial_hypotheses_allows_presenting_anything_as_a_replicated_finding_53697323/"},{"date":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Descriptive studies of natural history have always been a source of knowledge on which experimental work and scientific progress rely.

Here we overcome this obstacle and describe a robust method for screening by high-throughput electron microscopy. Our approach uses combinations of fluorophores as barcodes to mark the genotype of each cell in mixed populations, and correlative light and electron microscopy to read the fluorescent barcode of each cell before it is imaged by electron microscopy. Coupled with an easy-to-use software workflow for correlation, segmentation and computer image analysis, our method allows to extract and analyze multiple cell populations from each EM sample preparation. We demonstrate the method on several organelles with samples that each contain up to 15 different yeast variants.

In this work, we show that when the training set contains examples derived from the same genomic loci across multiple cell types, the resulting model can be susceptible to a particular form of bias related to memorizing the average activity associated with each genomic locus. Consequently, the trained model may appear to perform well when evaluated on the genomic loci that it was trained on but tends to perform poorly on loci that it was not trained on.

Yet the causes of differential diversification are little known despite their relevance for sustaining biodiversity into the future. Here we investigate rates of species diversification across extant Mammalia, a compelling system that includes our own closest relatives. We develop a new phylogeny of nearly all ∼6000 species using a 31-gene supermatrix and fossil node- and tip-dating approaches to establish a robust evolutionary timescale for mammals. Our findings link the causes of uneven modern species richness with ecologically-driven variation in rates of speciation andor extinction, including 24 detected shifts in net diversification. Speciation rates are a stronger predictor of among-clade richness than clade age, countering claims of clock-like speciation in large phylogenies. Surprisingly, speciation rate heterogeneity in recent radiations shows limited association with latitude, despite the well-known increase in species richness toward the equator. Instead, we find a deeper-time association where clades of high-latitude species have the highest speciation rates, suggesting that species durations are shorter (turnover is higher) outside than inside the tropics. At shallower timescales (i.e., young clades), diurnality and low vagility are both linked to greater speciation rates and extant richness. We suggest that high turnover among small-ranged allopatric species has erased the signal of vagility in older clades, while diurnality has adaptively promoted lineage persistence. These findings highlight the underappreciated joint roles of ephemeral (turnover-based) and adaptive (persistence-based) processes of diversification, which manifest in recent and more ancient evolutionary radiations of mammals to explain modern diversity.Author SummaryThe over 6000 living species in the mammalian tree of life are distributed unevenly among branches so that similarly aged groups sometimes differ many fold in species richness (e.g., ∼2500 rodent species versus 8 pangolins). Why differential bursts of species diversification occur, and how long they persist, has implications for sustaining biodiversity.

Mammals with low dispersal or that are day-active show the fastest recent speciation rates, consistent with mechanisms of allopatric isolation and ecological opportunity, respectively.

Methods and Results Associations between VRFs (smoking, hypertension, pulse pressure, diabetes, hypercholersterolaemia, BMI, and waist-hip ratio) and both global and regional brain structural and diffusion MRI markers were examined in UK Biobank (N = 9722, age range 44-77 years). A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R2 ≤ 1.8%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker. Conclusion Higher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macro- and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres. Though effect sizes were small, these results emphasise the vulnerability of brain health to vascular factors even in relatively healthy middle and older age, and the potential to partly ameliorate cognitive decline by addressing these malleable risk factors.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Associations between vascular risk factors and brain MRI indices in UK Biobank Supplementary Material, bioRxiv, 2019-01-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/associations_between_vascular_risk_factors_and_brain_mri_indices_in_uk_biobank_supplementary_material_53428046/"},{"date":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","description":"Beginning in late 2016, diplomats posted to the United States embassy in Cuba began to experience unexplained health problems including ear pain, tinnitus, vertigo, and cognitive difficulties which reportedly began after they heard strange noises in their homes or hotel rooms. In response, the U.S. government dramatically reduced the number of diplomats posted at the U.S. embassy in Havana. U.S. officials initially believed a sonic attack might be responsible for their ailments. The sound linked to these attacks, which has been described as a high-pitched beam of sound, was recorded by U.S. personnel in Cuba and released by the Associated Press (AP). Because these recordings are the only available non-medical evidence of the sonic attacks, much attention has focused on identifying health problems and the origin of the acoustic signal. As shown here, the calling song of the Indies short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus celerinictus) matches, in nuanced detail, the AP recording in duration, pulse repetition rate, power spectrum, pulse rate stability, and oscillations per pulse. The AP recording also exhibits frequency decay in individual pulses, a distinct acoustic signature of cricket sound production. While the temporal pulse structure in the recording is unlike any natural insect source, when the cricket call is played on a loudspeaker and recorded indoors, the interaction of reflected sound pulses yields a sound virtually indistinguishable from the AP sample. This provides strong evidence that an echoing cricket call, rather than a sonic attack or other technological device, is responsible for the sound in the released recording. Although the causes of the health problems reported by embassy personnel are beyond the scope of this paper, our findings highlight the need for more rigorous research into the source of these ailments, including the potential psychogenic effects, as well as possible physiological explanations unrelated to sonic attacks.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Recording of sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba spectrally matches the echoing call of a Caribbean cricket, bioRxiv, 2019-01-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/recording_of_sonic_attacks_on_u.s._diplomats_in_cuba_spectrally_matches_the_echoing_call_of_a_caribbean_cricket_53461299/"},{"date":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesn't for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans' appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Enjoy The Violence Is appreciation for extreme music the result of cognitive control over the threat response system?, bioRxiv, 2019-01-03","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/enjoy_the_violence_is_appreciation_for_extreme_music_the_result_of_cognitive_control_over_the_threat_response_system_53390267/"},{"date":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes use multiple sensory modalities to hunt human hosts to obtain a blood-meal for egg production. Attractive cues include carbon dioxide (CO2), a major component of exhaled breath [1, 2]; heat elevated above ambient temperature, signifying warm-blooded skin [3, 4]; and dark visual contrast [5, 6], proposed to bridge long-range olfactory and short-range thermal cues [7]. Any of these sensory cues in isolation is an incomplete signal of a human host, and so a mosquito must integrate multi-modal sensory information before committing to approaching and biting a person [8]. Here, we study the interaction of visual cues, heat, and CO2 to investigate the contributions of human-associated stimuli to host-seeking decisions. We show that tethered flying mosquitoes strongly orient toward dark visual contrast regardless of CO2 stimulation and internal host-seeking status. This suggests that attraction to visual contrast is general, and not contingent on other host cues. In free-flight experiments with CO2, adding a dark contrasting visual cue to a warmed surface enhanced host-seeking. Moderate warmth became more attractive to mosquitoes, and mosquitoes aggregated on the cue at all non-noxious temperatures. Gr3 mutants, unable to detect CO2, were lured to the visual cue at ambient temperatures, but fled and did not return when the surface was warmed to host-like temperatures. This suggests that attraction to thermal cues is contingent on the presence of the additional human sensory cue CO2. Our results illustrate that mosquitoes integrate general attractive visual stimuli with the context-dependent thermal stimuli to seek promising sites for blood-feeding.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"General visual and contingent thermal cues interact to elicit attraction in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, bioRxiv, 2019-01-03","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/general_visual_and_contingent_thermal_cues_interact_to_elicit_attraction_in_female_aedes_aegypti_mosquitoes_53411958/"},{"date":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractVariation across dog breeds presents a unique opportunity for investigating the evolution and biological basis of complex behavioral traits.

Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size, the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and intrinsic noise in neural circuits.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Fundamental bounds on learning performance in neural circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-01-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/fundamental_bounds_on_learning_performance_in_neural_circuits_53324811/"},{"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for drug brain delivery.

The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imagingangiography (MRIMRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score \u0026gt; 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRIMRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Precision Medicine Advancements Using Whole Genome Sequencing, Noninvasive Whole Body Imaging, and Functional Diagnostics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/precision_medicine_advancements_using_whole_genome_sequencing_noninvasive_whole_body_imaging_and_functional_diagnostics_52788699/"},{"date":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Microtubules are dynamic polymers that are used for intracellular transport and chromosome segregation during cell division. Their instability stems from the low energy of tubulin dimer interactions, which sets the growing polymer close to its disassembly conditions. Microtubules function in coordination with kinesin and dynein molecular motors, which use ATP hydrolysis to produce mechanical work and move on microtubules. This raises the possibility that the forces produced by walking motors can break dimer interactions and trigger microtubule disassembly. We tested this hypothesis by studying the interplay between microtubules and moving molecular motors in vitro. Our results show that the mechanical work of molecular motors can remove tubulin dimers from the lattice and rapidly destroy microtubules. This effect was not observed when free tubulin dimers were present in the assay. Using fluorescently labelled tubulin dimers we found that dimer removal by motors was compensated for by the insertion of free tubulin dimers into the microtubule lattice. This self-repair mechanism allows microtubules to survive the damage induced by molecular motors as they move along their tracks. Our study reveals the existence of coupling between the motion of kinesin and dynein motors and the renewal of the microtubule lattice.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Self-repair protects microtubules from their destruction by molecular motors, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/self-repair_protects_microtubules_from_their_destruction_by_molecular_motors_52789425/"},{"date":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractHow we process ongoing experiences is shaped by our personal history, current needs, and future goals.

Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences.

While much of this gender bias can be explained by historic sexism and discrimination, there is concern that women may still be disadvantaged by the peer review process if reviewers' unconscious biases lead them to reject publications with female authors more often. One potential solution to this perceived gender bias in the reviewing process is for journals to adopt double-blind reviews whereby neither the authors nor the reviewers are aware of each other's identities and genders. To test the efficacy of double-blind reviews, we assigned gender to every authorship of every paper published in 5 different journals with different peer review processes (double-blind vs. single blind) and subject matter (birds vs. behavioral ecology) from 2010-2018 (n = 4865 papers). While female authorships comprised only 35% of the total, the double-blind journal Behavioral Ecology did not have more female authorships than its single-blind counterparts. Interestingly, the incidence of female authorship is higher at behavioral ecology journals (Behavioral Ecology and Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) than in the ornithology journals (Auk, Condor, Ibis), for papers on all topics as well as those on birds. These analyses suggest that double-blind review does not currently increase the incidence of female authorship in the journals studied here. We conclude, at least for these journals, that double-blind review does not benefit female authors and may, in the long run, be detrimental.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"The Case For and Against Double-blind Reviews, bioRxiv, 2018-12-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_case_for_and_against_double-blind_reviews_52725309/"},{"date":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSmall proteins likely abound in prokaryotes, and may mediate much of the communication that occurs between organisms within a microbiome and their host. Unfortunately, small proteins are traditionally overlooked in biology, in part due to the computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify novel small proteins, we carried out a large comparative genomics study on 1,773 HMP human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites (mouth, gut, skin and vagina). We describe more than four thousand conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ~30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain, and almost half are not represented in reference genomes, emphasizing the incompleteness of knowledge in this space. Our analysis exposes putative novel ‘housekeeping’ small protein families, including a potential novel ribosomally associated protein, as well as ‘mammalian-specific’ or ‘human-specific’ protein families. By analyzing the genomic neighborhood of small genes, we pinpoint a subset of families that are potentially associated with defense against bacteriophage. Finally, we identify families that may be subject to horizontal transfer and are thus potentially involved in adaptation of bacteria to the changing human environment. Our study suggest that small proteins are highly abundant and that those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Large-scale analyses of human microbiomes reveal thousands of small, novel genes and their predicted functions, bioRxiv, 2018-12-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/large-scale_analyses_of_human_microbiomes_reveal_thousands_of_small_novel_genes_and_their_predicted_functions_52616107/"},{"date":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","description":"European populations display low genetic diversity as the result of long term blending of the small number of ancient founding ancestries.

Here we show RNase-sensitive CTCF self-association in vitro and that an RNA-binding region (RBR) mediates CTCF clustering in vivo. Intriguingly, deleting the RBR abolishes or impairs almost half of all chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells. Disrupted loop formation correlates with abrogated clustering and diminished chromatin binding of the RBR mutant CTCF protein, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least 2 classes RBR-independent and RBR-dependent loops. We suggest that evidence for distinct classes of RBR-dependent loops may provide a mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops regulated by RNAs and other RBR partner.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"An RNA-binding region regulates CTCF clustering and chromatin looping, bioRxiv, 2018-12-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/an_rna-binding_region_regulates_ctcf_clustering_and_chromatin_looping_52608001/"},{"date":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryThe success of immunotherapy has led to a myriad of new clinical trials.

In this context, periodicity refers to the time interval between the same phases of two consecutive cell cycles. The length of this interval, or the cell cycle speed, varies widely depending on cell type and the pathophysiological conditions. The relevance of cell cycle speed in various biological contexts has not been well-studied, partially due to the lack of experimental approaches that capture this parameter. Here, we describe a genetically encoded live-cell reporter of cell cycle speed. This reporter is based on the color-changing Fluorescent Timer (FT) protein, which emits blue fluorescence when newly synthesized before maturing into a red fluorescent protein. Its ability to report cell cycle speed exploits the different half-life of the blue vs. red form of the same molecule, as predicted by mathematical modeling. When a Histone H2B-FT fusion protein is expressed at steady-state in heterogeneously dividing cells, faster-cycling cells can be distinguished from slower-cycling ones by differences in their intracellular ratio between the blue and red fluorescent wavelengths. Cell cycle perturbation experiments demonstrate that the H2B-FT is a bona fide reporter of cell cycle speed in multiple cultured cell lines. In vivo, the bluered profile faithfully tracked with known proliferation kinetics of various hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, when expressed either from lentiviral vectors or from a targeted knock-in allele. As the H2B-FT is compatible with flow cytometry, it provides a strategy to physically separate subpopulations of live cells cycling at different rates for downstream analysis. We anticipate this system to be useful in diverse cell types and tissue contexts for dissecting the role of cell cycle speed in development and disease.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"A fluorescent reporter enables instantaneous measurement of cell cycle speed in live cells, bioRxiv, 2018-12-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_fluorescent_reporter_enables_instantaneous_measurement_of_cell_cycle_speed_in_live_cells_52553188/"},{"date":"2018-12-12T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryCell proliferation changes concomitantly with fate transitions during reprogramming, differentiation, regeneration, and oncogenesis.

However, both speciation and hybridization can occur with negligible morphological differentiation. The Northwestern Crow (Corvus caurinus) and American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos) are sister taxonomic species with a continuous distribution that lack reliable traditional characters for identification. In this first population genomic study of Northwestern and American crows, we use genomic SNPs (nuDNA) and mtDNA to investigate whether these crows are genetically differentiated and the extent to which they may hybridize. We found that American and Northwestern crows have distinct evolutionary histories, supported by two nuDNA ancestry clusters and two 1.1%-divergent mtDNA clades dating to the late Pleistocene, when glacial advances may have isolated crow populations in separate refugia. We document extensive hybridization, with geographic overlap of mtDNA clades and admixture of nuDNA across \u0026gt;1,400 km of western Washington and western British Columbia. This broad hybrid zone consists of late-generation hybrids and backcrosses, not recent (e.g., F1) hybrids. Nuclear DNA and mtDNA clines were both centered in southwestern British Columbia, farther north than previously postulated. The mtDNA cline was narrower than the nuDNA cline, consistent with Haldane’s rule but not sex-biased dispersal. Overall, our results suggest a history of reticulate evolution in American and Northwestern crows, consistent with potentially recurring neutral expansion(s) from Pleistocene glacial refugia followed by lineage fusion(s).

However, little is known about the genetic basis of SD in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and to what extant genetic variation exists in contemporary wheat germplasm. Here, we evaluated stomatal patterning over two growing seasons in a set of 333 wheat lines, representing the European winter wheat germplasm. Stomatal patterning was mainly determined by two underlying traits, the distance between files of stomata and the distance between stomata within a file. By haplotype association mapping, quantitative trait loci for SD were consistently detected in both seasons on wheat chromosomes (CHR) 2A, 3A and 7B. The single nucleotide polymorphism markers most significantly associated with SD coincided with the genes INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) and STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS-DEFECTIVE 1 (SCD1) on CHR 3A, and genes involved in ethylene and auxin signaling on CHR 2A and 7B, respectively.

Consequently, our knowledge of the capacity and dynamics of HGT in complex communities is limited. Here, we utilize the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process to detect HGT events from complex microbiota in real-time and at nucleotide resolution. In this system, a recording strain is exposed to a microbial sample, spacers are acquired from foreign transferred elements and permanently stored in genomic CRISPR arrays. Subsequently, sequencing and analysis of these spacers enables identification of the transferred elements. This approach allowed us to quantify transfer frequencies of individual mobile elements without the need for phenotypic markers or post-transfer replication. We show that HGT in human clinical fecal samples can be extensive and rapid, often involving multiple different plasmid types, with the IncX type being the most actively transferred.

Many approaches to reconstruct evolutionary histories focus on a limited number of informative statistics describing distributions of allele frequencies or patterns of linkage disequilibrium. We show that many commonly used statistics are part of a broad family of two-locus moments whose expectation can be computed jointly and rapidly under a wide range of scenarios, including complex multi-population demographies with continuous migration and admixture events. A full inspection of these statistics reveals that widely used models of human history fail to predict simple patterns of linkage disequilibrium. To jointly capture the information contained in classical and novel statistics, we implemented a tractable likelihood-based inference framework for demographic history. Using this approach, we show that human evolutionary models that include archaic admixture in Africa, Asia, and Europe provide a much better description of patterns of genetic diversity across the human genome. We estimate that an unidentified, deeply diverged population admixed with modern humans within Africa both before and after the split of African and Eurasian populations, contributing 4 - 8% genetic ancestry to individuals in world-wide populations.Author SummaryThroughout human history, populations have expanded and contracted, split and merged, and ex-changed migrants. Because these events affected genetic diversity, we can learn about human history by comparing predictions from evolutionary models to genetic data. Here, we show how to rapidly compute such predictions for a wide range of diversity measures within and across populations under complex demographic scenarios. While widely used models of human history accurately predict common measures of diversity, we show that they strongly underestimate the co-occurence of low frequency mutations within human populations in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Models allowing for archaic admixture, the relatively recent mixing of human populations with deeply diverged human lineages, resolve this discrepancy. We use such models to infer demographic models that include both recent and ancient features of human history. We recover the well-characterized admixture of Neanderthals in Eurasian populations, as well as admixture from an as-yet unknown diverged human population within Africa, further suggesting that admixture with deeply diverged lineages occurred multiple times in human history. By simultaneously testing model predictions for a broad range of diversity statistics, we can assess the robustness of common evolutionary models, identify missing historical events, and build more informed models of human demography.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Models of archaic admixture and recent history from two-locus statistics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/models_of_archaic_admixture_and_recent_history_from_two-locus_statistics_52355933/"},{"date":"2018-12-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMuscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC) is a molecularly diverse disease with heterogeneous clinical outcomes.

We thus present the most comprehensive catalog of similarities and differences in gene expression and methylation levels between livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs, in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques.

Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers.

The sensory organs underlying vibration detection, called slit sensilla, resemble cracks in the spider's exoskeleton, and are distributed all over the spider body. Those crucial to sensing web- and other substrate-borne vibrations are called lyriform organs and are densely distributed around leg joints. It has been shown that forces that cause bending at leg joints also activate these lyriform organs. Little is known of how the biomechanics of the body of a freely-suspended spider in its natural posture interact with vibrations introduced into the body and how this affects vibration perception. Female black widow spiders, in particular, have a striking body-form; their long thin legs support a large pendulous abdomen. Here, we show that in their natural posture, the large abdominal mass of black widow females, interacts with the spring-like behaviour of their leg joints and determines the mechanical behaviour of different leg joints. Furthermore, we find that adopting different body postures enables females to alter both the level and tuning of the mechanical input to lyriform organs. Therefore, we suggest that posture may be used to flexibly and reversibly focus attention to different classes or components of web vibration. Postural effects thus emphasize the dynamic loop of interactions between behaviour and perception, i.e. between 'brain' and body.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Posture controls mechanical tuning in the black widow spider mechanosensory system, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/posture_controls_mechanical_tuning_in_the_black_widow_spider_mechanosensory_system_52202031/"},{"date":"2018-12-05T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYIn response to foreign and endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), protein kinase R (PKR) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) reprogram translation in mammalian cells.

The mechanisms of RNase L-driven translation repression, its contribution to SG assembly, and its regulation of dsRNA stress-induced mRNAs are unknown. We demonstrate that RNase L drives translational shut-off in response to dsRNA by promoting widespread turnover of mRNAs. This alters stress granule assembly and reprograms translation by only allowing for the translation of mRNAs resistant to RNase L degradation, including numerous antiviral mRNAs such as IFN-β. Individual cells differentially activate dsRNA responses revealing variation that can affect cellular outcomes. This identifies bulk mRNA degradation and the resistance of antiviral mRNAs as the mechanism by which RNaseL reprograms translation in response to dsRNA.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"RNase L reprograms translation by widespread mRNA turnover escaped by antiviral mRNAs, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rnase_l_reprograms_translation_by_widespread_mrna_turnover_escaped_by_antiviral_mrnas_52201035/"},{"date":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolygenic scores (PS) are becoming a useful tool to identify individuals with high genetic risk for complex diseases and several projects are currently testing their utility for translational applications.

Here, we evaluate geographic differences, and related biases, of PS in Finland with geographically well-defined sample of 2,376 individuals from the National FINRISK study. First, we detect geographic differences in PS for coronary artery disease (CAD), rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, waits-hip ratio (WHR), body-mass index (BMI) and height, but not for Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Second, we use height as a model trait to thoroughly assess the possible population genetic biases in PS and apply similar approaches to the other phenotypes. Most importantly, we detect suspiciously large accumulation of geographic differences for CAD, WHR, BMI and height, suggesting bias arising from population genetic structure rather than from a direct genotype-phenotype association. This work demonstrates how sensitive the geographic patterns of current PS are for small biases even within relatively homogenous populations and provides simple tools to identify such biases. A thorough understanding of the effects of population genetic structure on PS is essential for translational applications of PS.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Geographic variation and bias in polygenic scores of complex diseases and traits in Finland, bioRxiv, 2018-12-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/geographic_variation_and_bias_in_polygenic_scores_of_complex_diseases_and_traits_in_finland_52182179/"},{"date":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","description":"This article describes Bacillus anthracis strains isolated during an outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal Peninsula in the summer of 2016 and independently in Yakutia in 2015.

The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in B. anthracis population. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to this polytomy is suggesting that this polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe.

In human cortex single-cell gene expression data, expression of risk genes is enriched in both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages, consistent with multiple paths to an excitatoryinhibitory imbalance underlying ASD.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Large-scale exome sequencing study implicates both developmental and functional changes in the neurobiology of autism, bioRxiv, 2018-12-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/large-scale_exome_sequencing_study_implicates_both_developmental_and_functional_changes_in_the_neurobiology_of_autism_52024757/"},{"date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTMeiotic crossovers (COs) ensure proper chromosome segregation and redistribute the genetic variation that is transmitted to the next generation.

We demonstrate that E-ChRPs function both in vivo and in vitro to specifically reposition target nucleosomes and entire nucleosomal arrays, and possess the ability to evict native DNA-binding proteins through their action. E-ChRPs can be designed with a range of targeting modalities, including the SpyCatcher and dCas9 moieties, resulting in high versatility and enabling diverse future applications.

To identify mechanisms that drive change in tree size, density, and carbon, we need a better understanding of forest structural trajectories and the factors that affect those trajectories. Here we reveal a coherent, cyclic pattern of structural change in temperate forests, as predicted by successional theory, and identify significant sensitivity to climatic precipitation and temperature anomalies using large datasets and empirical modeling. For example, in the eastern US above average temperature (+1°C) was associated with a 27% (−0.4±0.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) reduction in productivity attributed to higher rates of disease (+23%), weather disturbance (+57%), and sapling mortality. Projections of future vegetative carbon sink potential suggests biomass would be lowest on managed lands (72±2 Mg C ha-1) and highest when larger trees survive in undisturbed conditions (153±21 Mg C ha-1). Overall, the indirect effects of disturbance and mortality were considerably larger than the direct effects of climate on productivity when predicting future vegetative carbon sinks.

While apparently evolutionarily conserved1–12, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is not well understood at the molecular or behavioral levels. Here we describe our discovery that C. elegans can pass on a learned pathogenic avoidance behavior to their progeny for several generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Although worms are initially attracted to the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (PA14)13, they can learn to avoid this pathogen13. We found that prolonged PA14 exposure results in transmission of avoidance behavior to progeny that have themselves never been exposed to PA14, and this behavior persists through the fourth generation. This form of transgenerational inheritance of bacterial avoidance is specific to pathogenic P. aeruginosa, requires physical contact and infection, and is distinct from CREB-dependent long-term associative memory and larval imprinting. The TGF-β ligand daf-7, whose expression increases in the ASJ upon initial exposure to PA1414, is highly expressed in the ASI neurons of progeny of trained mothers until the fourth generation, correlating with transgenerational avoidance behavior. Mutants of histone modifiers and small RNA mediators display defects in naïve PA14 attraction and aversive learning. By contrast, the germline-expressed PRG-1Piwi homolog15 is specifically required for transgenerational inheritance of avoidance behavior.

Also, underlying this seductive power of curiosity is its incentive salience properties, which share common neural mechanisms with extrinsic incentives (i.e. hunger for foods).

In particular, mutations in genes that are required for basic cellular functions andor reproduction often interfere with the generation of homozygous mutant plants, precluding further functional studies. To overcome this limitation, we devised a CRISPR-based tissue-specific knockout system, CRISPR-TSKO, enabling the generation of somatic mutations in particular plant cell types, tissues, and organs.

This trait can be measured as the size of plant seeds, animal eggs, or live young, and it influences ecological interactions, organism fitness, maternal investment, and embryonic development. Although multiple evolutionary processes have been predicted to drive the evolution of offspring size, the phylogenetic distribution of this trait remains poorly understood, due to the difficulty of reliably collecting and comparing offspring size data from many species. Here we present a database of 10,449 morphological descriptions of insect eggs, with records for 6,706 unique insect species and representatives from every extant hexapod order.

In the process, we overcame challenges associated with large-scale phenotyping by designing and employing custom bioinformatic solutions to common problems.

It is increasingly appreciated that some evolutionary questions can only be adequately answered by combining evidence from multiple independent sources of data, including genome sequences, sampling dates, phenotypic data, radiocarbon dates, fossil occurrences, and biogeographic range information among others. Including all relevant data into a single joint model is very challenging both conceptually and computationally. Advanced computational software packages that allow robust development of compatible (sub-)models which can be composed into a full model hierarchy have played a key role in these developments.Developing such software frameworks is increasingly a major scientific activity in its own right, and comes with specific challenges, from practical software design, development and engineering challenges to statistical and conceptual modelling challenges. BEAST 2 is one such computational software platform, and was first announced over 4 years ago.

A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Deep Neural Networks and Kernel Regression Achieve Comparable Accuracies for Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior and Demographics, bioRxiv, 2018-11-20","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/deep_neural_networks_and_kernel_regression_achieve_comparable_accuracies_for_functional_connectivity_prediction_of_behavior_and_demographics_51420417/"},{"date":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","description":"Behavior arises from neuronal activity, but it is not known how the active neurons are distributed across brain regions and how their activity unfolds in time.

Here, we created a large-scale US longitudinal disease network of traced readmission patterns (i.e., disease trajectories), merging data from over 10.4 million inpatients from 350 California hospitals through the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project between 1980 and 2010. We were able to create longitudinal representations of disease progression mapping over 300 common diseases, including the well-known complication of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Surprisingly, out of these generated disease trajectories, we discovered an unknown association between schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder, and rhabdomyolysis, a rare disease of muscle breakdown. It was found that 92 of 3674 patients (2.5%) with schizophrenia were readmitted for rhabdomyolysis (relative risk, 2.21 [1.80–2.71, confidence interval = 0.95] P-value 9.54E-15), which has a general population incidence of 1 in 10,000. We validated this association using independent electronic health records from over 830,000 patients treated over seven years at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) medical center. A case review of 29 patients at UCSF who were treated for schizophrenia and who went on to develop rhabdomyolysis demonstrated that the majority of cases (62%) are idiopathic, which suggests a biological connection between these two diseases.

In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then amplifies the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event.

Yet, a connection between phase separation and chromatin compaction has not been experimentally demonstrated. More fundamentally, how HP1 action at the level of a single nucleosome drives chromatin compaction remains poorly understood. Here we directly demonstrate that the S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, compacts arrays of multiple nucleosomes into phase-separated droplets. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange, NMR, and mass-spectrometry, we further find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a mononucleosome. Restraining these dynamics via site-specific disulfide bonds impairs the compaction of nucleosome arrays into phase-separated droplets. Our results indicate that chromatin compaction and phase separation can be highly coupled processes. Further, we find that such coupling is promoted by a counter-intuitive function of Swi6, namely disorganization of the octamer core. Phase separation is canonically mediated by weak and dynamic multivalent interactions. We propose that dynamic exposure of buried histone residues increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby coupling chromatin compaction to phase separation. We anticipate that this new model for chromatin organization may more generally explain the formation of highly compacted chromatin assemblies beyond heterochromatin.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Disorganization of the histone core promotes organization of heterochromatin into phase-separated droplets, bioRxiv, 2018-11-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/disorganization_of_the_histone_core_promotes_organization_of_heterochromatin_into_phase-separated_droplets_51385915/"},{"date":"2018-11-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe introduce the Barcode-UMI-Set format (BUS) for representing pseudoalignments of reads from single-cell RNA-seq experiments.

We examined the population genetic history of beer strains and find that ale strains and the S. cerevisiae portion of allotetraploid lager strains were derived from admixture between populations closely related to European grape wine strains and Asian rice wine strains. Similar to both lager and baking strains, ale strains are polyploid, providing them with a passive means of remaining isolated from other populations and providing us with a living relic of their ancestral hybridization. To reconstruct their polyploid origin we phased the genomes of two ale strains and found ale haplotypes to both be recombinants between European and Asian alleles and to also contain novel alleles derived from extinct or as yet uncharacterized populations.

These behavioral transitions have been hypothesized to go hand-in-hand with an increased ability to regulate when and where genes are expressed. Bees have convergently evolved eusociality up to five times, providing a framework to test this hypothesis. To examine potential links between putative gene regulatory elements and social evolution, we compare alignable, non-coding sequences in eleven diverse bee species, encompassing three independent origins of reproductive division of labor and two elaborations of eusocial complexity. We find that rates of evolution in a number of non-coding sequences correlate with key social transitions in bees. Interestingly, while we find little evidence for convergent rate changes associated with independent origins of social behavior, a number of molecular pathways exhibit convergent rate changes in conjunction with subsequent elaborations of social organization. We also present evidence that many novel non-coding regions may have been recruited alongside the origin of sociality in corbiculate bees; these loci could represent gene regulatory elements associated with division of labor within this group. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gene regulatory innovations are associated with the evolution of eusociality and illustrate how a thorough examination of both coding and non-coding sequence can provide a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Rate variation in the evolution of non-coding DNA associated with social evolution in bees, bioRxiv, 2018-11-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rate_variation_in_the_evolution_of_non-coding_dna_associated_with_social_evolution_in_bees_50953621/"},{"date":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","description":"Photosynthetic organisms provide food and energy for nearly all life on Earth, yet half of their protein-coding genes remain uncharacterized1,2.

With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of ∼ 106 cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes.

VR has long featured in studies of Drosophila melanogaster, but these experiments have typically relied on one-dimensional (1D) VR, effectively allowing the fly to change only its heading in a visual scene, and not its position. Here we explore how flies navigate in a two-dimensional (2D) visual VR environment that more closely resembles their experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ interaction with landmarks in 2D environments cannot be automatically derived from their behavior in simpler 1D environments. Using a novel paradigm, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D VR adapt their behavior in a visual environment in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search behavior. Finally, by pairing optogenetic activation of heat-sensing cells to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of landmarks associated with aversive “virtual heat”.

This process is thought to be driven by sexual selection and may reinforce species separation. However, while the genetic basis of many phenotypic differences have been identified, we still lack knowledge about the genes underlying evolutionary differences in male genital organs and organ size more generally. The claspers (surstyli) are periphallic structures that play an important role in copulation in insects. Here we show that natural variation in clasper size and bristle number between Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans is caused by evolutionary changes in tartan (trn), which encodes a transmembrane leucine-rich repeat domain protein that mediates cell-cell interactions and affinity differences. There are no fixed amino acid differences in trn between D. mauritiana and D. simulans but differences in the expression of this gene in developing genitalia suggest cis-regulatory changes in trn underlie the evolution of clasper morphology in these species. Finally, analysis of reciprocal hemizyotes that are genetically identical, except for which species the functional allele of trn is from, determined that the trn allele of D. mauritiana specifies larger claspers with more bristles than the allele of D. simulans. Therefore we have identified the first gene underlying evolutionary change in the size of a male genital organ, which will help to better understand the rapid diversification of these structures and the regulation and evolution of organ size more broadly.Significance StatementThe morphology of male genital organs evolves rapidly driven by sexual selection. However, little is known about the genes underlying genitalia differences between species. Identifying these genes is key to understanding how sexual selection acts on development to produce rapid phenotypic change. We have found that the gene tartan underlies differences between male Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans in the size and bristle number of the claspers - genital projections that grasp the female during copulation. Moreover, since tartan encodes a protein that is involved in cell affinity, this may represent a new developmental mechanism for morphological change.

As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, including high-dimensional immunophenotypes, chromatin accessibility, and spatial positioning, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these datasets into a harmonized atlas that can be used to better understand cellular identity and function. Here, we develop a computational strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we demonstrate how anchoring can harmonize in-situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing for the transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns, and the identification of spatial relationships between mapped cell types in the visual cortex.

A genetic map derived from a tetrahydrocannabinolcannabidiol segregating population and a complete chromosome assembly from a high-cannabidiol cultivar together resolve the linkage of cannabidiolic and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase gene clusters which are associated with transposable elements.

However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates.

Although ribosomes are essential in all cells, disruptions to ribosome biogenesis lead to heterogeneous phenotypes. Here, we modeled these perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result immediately in acute loss of proteostasis (protein folding homeostasis). Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes. In response, proteostasis genes are activated by an Hsf1-dependent stress response pathway that is required for recovery from r-protein assembly stress. Importantly, we show that exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes. Our results highlight ribosome assembly as a linchpin of cellular homeostasis, representing a key proteostasis vulnerability for rapidly proliferating cells that may be compromised by diverse genetic, environmental, and xenobiotic conditions that generate orphan r-proteins.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"A risk-reward tradeoff of high ribosome production in proliferating cells, bioRxiv, 2018-10-31","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_risk-reward_tradeoff_of_high_ribosome_production_in_proliferating_cells_50556077/"},{"date":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","description":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is noisy and sparse.

Neither of these methods lends itself to high-throughput screens to identify novel meiotic factors. Here, we establish visual assays novel to Sz. pombe for characterizing chromosome segregation and meiotic recombination phenotypes. Genes expressing red, yellow, andor cyan fluorophores from spore-autonomous promoters have been integrated into the fission yeast genomes, either close to the centromere of chromosome I to monitor chromosome segregation, or on the arm of chromosome III to form a genetic interval at which recombination frequency can be determined. The visual recombination assay allows straightforward and immediate assessment of the genetic outcome of a single meiosis by epi-fluorescence microscopy without requiring tetrad dissection.

However, because of genetic diversity and the diploid nature of the human genome, we hypothesized that using a generic reference could lead to incorrectly mapped reads and bias downstream results.ResultsWe show that accounting for genetic variation using a modified reference genome (MPG) or a denovo assembled genome (DPG) can alter histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq peak calls by either creating new personal peaks or by the loss of reference peaks. MPGs are found to alter approximately 1% of peak calls while DPGs alter up to 5% of peaks. We also show statistically significant differences in the amount of reads observed in regions associated with the new, altered and unchanged peaks. We report that short insertions and deletions (indels), followed by single nucleotide variants (SNVs), have the highest probability of modifying peak calls. A counter-balancing factor is peak width, with wider calls being less likely to be altered. Next, because high-quality DPGs remain hard to obtain, we show that using a graph personalized genome (GPG), represents a reasonable compromise between MPGs and DPGs and alters about 2.5% of peak calls. Finally, we demonstrate that altered peaks have a genomic distribution typical of other peaks. For instance, for H3K4me1, 518 personal-only peaks were replicated using at least two of three approaches, 394 of which were inside or within 10Kb of a gene.ConclusionsAnalysing epigenomic datasets with personalized and graph genomes allows the recovery of new peaks enriched for indels and SNVs.

Here we go beyond previous theories to analyze how a simple linear retinal encoding model with different convolutional cell types efficiently encodes naturalistic spatiotemporal movies given a fixed firing rate budget. We find that optimizing the receptive fields and cell densities of two cell types makes them match the properties of the two main cell types in the primate retina, midget and parasol cells, in terms of spatial and temporal sensitivity, cell spacing, and their relative ratio. Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types.

Recent attempts to overcome this fundamental challenge rely on employing additional in situ gene expression imaging data which can guide spatial mapping of sequenced cells. Here we present a conceptually different approach that allows to reconstruct spatial positions of cells in a variety of tissues without using reference imaging data. We first show for several complex biological systems that distances of single cells in expression space monotonically increase with their physical distances across tissues. We therefore seek to map cells to tissue space such that this principle is optimally preserved, while matching existing imaging data when available. We show that this optimization problem can be cast as a generalized optimal transport problem and solved efficiently.

In other words, do individual DA neurons multiplex multiple variables, or are subsets of neurons specialized in encoding specific behavioral variables? The reason that this fundamental question has been difficult to resolve is that recordings from large populations of individual DA neurons have not been performed in a behavioral task with sufficient complexity to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we used 2-photon calcium imaging through an implanted lens to record activity of \u0026gt;300 midbrain DA neurons in the VTA during a complex decision-making task.

To compare the subcellular architecture of solitary collar cells in S. rosetta with that of multicellular “rosettes” and collar cells in sponges, we reconstructed entire cells in 3D through transmission electron microscopy on serial ultrathin sections.

The oskar gene evolved to fulfil a crucial role in insect germ cell formation, but was long considered a novel gene with unknown evolutionary origins. Our analysis of over 100 Oskar sequences suggests that Oskar arose through a novel gene formation history involving fusion of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. One of its two conserved domains (LOTUS), was likely present in the genome of a last common insect ancestor, while the second (OSK) domain appears to have been acquired through horizontal transfer of a bacterial GDSL-like lipase domain. Our evidence suggests that the bacterial contributor of the OSK domain may have been a germ line endosymbiont.

Most methods designed to detect positive selection along sequenced genomes, however, use simplified representations of past histories as null models of genetic drift. Here, we present the first method that can detect signatures of strong local adaptation across the genome using arbitrarily complex admixture graphs, which are typically used to describe the history of past divergence and admixture events among any number of populations. The method—called Graph-aware Retrieval of Selective Sweeps (GRoSS)—has good power to detect loci in the genome with strong evidence for past selective sweeps and can also identify which branch of the graph was most affected by the sweep. As evidence of its utility, we apply the method to bovine, codfish and human population genomic data containing multiple population panels related in complex ways. We find new candidate genes for important adaptive functions, including immunity and metabolism in under-studied human populations, as well as muscle mass, milk production and tameness in specific bovine breeds.

The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts.

A hallmark of this transition is the addition of multiple long bones to the proximal-distal axis of paired appendages. Whereas limb skeletons are often elaborate and diverse, teleost pectoral fins retain a simple endoskeleton. Fins and limbs share many core developmental processes, but how these programs were reshaped to produce limbs from fins during evolution remains enigmatic. Here we identify zebrafish mutants that form supernumerary long bones along the proximal-distal axis of pectoral fins with limb-like patterning. These new skeletal elements are integrated into the fin, as they are connected to the musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring bones. This phenotype is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage development, vav2 and waslb, which we show function in a common pathway. We find that this pathway functions in appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of Wasl in developing limbs results in patterning defects identical to those seen in Hoxall knockout mice. Concordantly, formation of supernumerary fin long bones requires the function of hoxall paralogs, indicating developmental homology with the forearm and the existence of a latent functional Hox code patterning the fin endoskeleton. Our findings reveal an inherent limb-like patterning ability in fins that can be activated by simple genetic perturbation, resulting in the elaboration of the endoskeleton.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Latent developmental potential to form limb-like skeletal structures in zebrafish, bioRxiv, 2018-10-23","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/latent_developmental_potential_to_form_limb-like_skeletal_structures_in_zebrafish_50117443/"},{"date":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Evolutionary theory has produced two conflicting paradigms for the adaptation of a polygenic trait. While population genetics views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis. The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a single compound parameter, the population-scaled background mutation rate Θbg, explains the main differences among these patterns. For a focal locus, Θbg measures the mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation proceeds by sweeps for small Θbg ≲0.1, while small polygenic allele frequency shifts require large Θbg ≳100. In the large intermediate regime, we observe a heterogeneous pattern of partial sweeps at several interacting loci.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Polygenic Adaptation From sweeps to subtle frequency shifts, bioRxiv, 2018-10-23","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/polygenic_adaptation_from_sweeps_to_subtle_frequency_shifts_50132793/"},{"date":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDuring sleep, the hippocampus plays an active role in consolidating memories that depend on it for initial encoding.

These genomes reveal complex patterns of past population admixture and replacement events throughout northeastern Siberia, with evidence for at least three large-scale human migrations into the region. The first inhabitants, a previously unknown population of “Ancient North Siberians” (ANS), represented by Yana RHS, diverged ~38 kya from Western Eurasians, soon after the latter split from East Asians. Between 20 and 11 kya, the ANS population was largely replaced by peoples with ancestry related to present-day East Asians, giving rise to ancestral Native Americans and “Ancient Paleosiberians” (AP), represented by a 9.8 kya skeleton from Kolyma River. AP are closely related to the Siberian ancestors of Native Americans, and ancestral to contemporary communities such as Koryaks and Itelmen. Paleoclimatic modelling shows evidence for a refuge during the last glacial maximum (LGM) in southeastern Beringia, suggesting Beringia as a possible location for the admixture forming both ancestral Native Americans and AP. Between 11 and 4 kya, AP were in turn largely replaced by another group of peoples with ancestry from East Asia, the “Neosiberians” from which many contemporary Siberians derive.

Drosophila melanogaster instead relies on specialized retrotransposons that insert preferentially at telomeres. This exchange of goods between host and mobile element—wherein the mobile element provides an essential genome service and the host provides a hospitable niche for mobile element propagation—has been called a ‘genomic symbiosis’. However, these telomere-specialized, ‘jockey’ family elements may actually evolve to selfishly over-replicate in the genomes that they ostensibly serve. Under this intra-genomic conflict model, we expect rapid diversification of telomere-specialized retrotransposon lineages and possibly, the breakdown of this tenuous relationship. Here we report data consistent with both predictions. Searching the raw reads of the 15-million-year-old ‘melanogaster species group’, we generated de novo jockey retrotransposon consensus sequences and used phylogenetic tree-building to delineate four distinct telomere-associated lineages. Recurrent gains, losses, and replacements account for this striking retrotransposon lineage diversity. Moreover, an ancestrally telomere-specialized element has ‘escaped,’ residing now throughout the genome of D. rhopaloa. In D. biarmipes, telomere-specialized elements have disappeared completely. De novo assembly of long-reads and cytogenetics confirmed this species-specific collapse of retrotransposon-dependent telomere elongation. Instead, telomere-restricted satellite DNA and DNA transposon fragments occupy its terminal ends. We infer that D. biarmipes relies instead on a recombination-based mechanism conserved from yeast to flies to humans. Combined with previous reports of adaptive evolution at host proteins that regulate telomere length, telomere-associated retrotransposon diversification and disappearance offer compelling evidence that intra-genomic conflict shapes Drosophila telomere evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Diversification and collapse of a telomere elongation mechanism, bioRxiv, 2018-10-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/diversification_and_collapse_of_a_telomere_elongation_mechanism_49862531/"},{"date":"2018-10-18T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractVirtually all tumors are genetically heterogeneous, containing subclonal populations of cells that are defined by distinct mutations1. Subclones can have unique phenotypes that influence disease progression2, but these phenotypes are difficult to characterize subclones usually cannot be physically purified, and bulk gene expression measurements obscure interclonal differences. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has revealed transcriptional heterogeneity within a variety of tumor types, but it is unclear how this expression heterogeneity relates to subclonal genetic events – for example, whether particular expression clusters correspond to mutationally defined subclones3,4,5,6-9. To address this question, we developed an approach that integrates enhanced whole genome sequencing (eWGS) with the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5’ Gene Expression workflow (scRNA-seq) to directly link expressed mutations with transcriptional profiles at single cell resolution. Using bone marrow samples from five cases of primary human Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), we generated WGS and scRNA-seq data for each case. Duplicate single cell libraries representing a median of 20,474 cells per case were generated from the bone marrow of each patient. Although the libraries were 5’ biased, we detected expressed mutations in cDNAs at distances up to 10 kbp from the 5’ ends of well-expressed genes, allowing us to identify hundreds to thousands of cells with AML-specific somatic mutations in every case. This data made it possible to distinguish AML cells (including normal-karyotype AML cells) from surrounding normal cells, to study tumor differentiation and intratumoral expression heterogeneity, to identify expression signatures associated with subclonal mutations, and to find cell surface markers that could be used to purify subclones for further study. The data also revealed transcriptional heterogeneity that occurred independently of subclonal mutations, suggesting that additional factors drive epigenetic heterogeneity. This integrative approach for connecting genotype to phenotype in AML cells is broadly applicable for analysis of any sample that is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Mutation detection in thousands of acute myeloid leukemia cells using single cell RNA-sequencing, bioRxiv, 2018-10-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/mutation_detection_in_thousands_of_acute_myeloid_leukemia_cells_using_single_cell_rna-sequencing_49857784/"},{"date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenome mining has become a key technology to explore and exploit natural product diversity through the identification and analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

Second, identity and gender representations of familiar faces were enhanced very early on, indicating that the previously-reported behavioral benefit for familiar faces results from tuning of early feed-forward processing mechanisms.

These associations have been proposed to reflect the lifelong consequences of an adverse intrauterine environment. In earlier work, we demonstrated that much of the negative correlation between BW and adult cardio-metabolic traits could instead be attributable to shared genetic effects. However, that work and other previous studies did not systematically distinguish the direct effects of an individual’s own genotype on BW and subsequent disease risk from indirect effects of their mother’s correlated genotype, mediated by the intrauterine environment. Here, we describe expanded genome-wide association analyses of own BW (n=321,223) and offspring BW (n=230,069 mothers), which identified 278 independent association signals influencing BW (214 novel). We used structural equation modelling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic influences on BW, implicating fetal- and maternal-specific mechanisms. We used Mendelian randomization to explore the causal relationships between factors influencing BW through fetal or maternal routes, for example, glycemic traits and blood pressure. Direct fetal genotype effects dominate the shared genetic contribution to the association between lower BW and higher type 2 diabetes risk, whereas the relationship between lower BW and higher later blood pressure (BP) is driven by a combination of indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects indirect effects of maternal BP-raising genotypes act to reduce offspring BW, but only direct fetal genotype effects (once inherited) increase the offspring’s later BP. Instrumental variable analysis using maternal BW-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring BP.

In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting an interchromosomal gene regulatory mechanism called transvection. Despite over a century of study, the molecular features that facilitate chromosome-wide pairing are unknown. The “button” model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with a higher affinity than their surrounding regions, but only a handful of DNA elements that drive homologous pairing between chromosomes have been described. Here, we identify button loci interspersed across the fly genome that have the ability to pair with their homologous sequences. Buttons are characterized by topologically associated domains (TADs), which drive pairing with their endogenous loci from multiple locations in the genome. Fragments of TADs do not pair, suggesting a model in which combinations of elements interspersed along the full length of a TAD are required for pairing. Though DNA-binding insulator proteins are not associated with pairing, buttons are enriched for insulator cofactors, suggesting that these proteins may mediate higher order interactions between homologous TADs. Using a TAD spanning the spinelessd gene as a paradigm, we find that pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. spineless pairing and transvection are cell-type-specific, suggesting that local buttoning and unbuttoning regulates transvection efficiency between cell types. Together, our data support a model in which specialized TADs button homologous chromosomes together to facilitate cell-type-specific interchromosomal gene regulation.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"TADs pair homologous chromosomes to promote interchromosomal gene regulation, bioRxiv, 2018-10-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/tads_pair_homologous_chromosomes_to_promote_interchromosomal_gene_regulation_49824201/"},{"date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","description":"RNA-sequencing data is widely used to identify disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

A subset of these variants, however, may have poor sequencing quality due to limitations in sequencing technology or in variant calling algorithms. In genetic studies that analyze a large number of sequenced individuals, it is critical to detect and remove those variants with poor quality as they may cause spurious findings. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for performing quality control on variants identified from NGS data by combining a traditional filtering approach and a machine learning approach. Our method uses information on sequencing quality such as sequencing depth, genotyping quality, and GC contents to predict whether a certain variant is likely to contain errors. To evaluate our method, we applied it to two whole-genome sequencing datasets where one dataset consists of related individuals from families while the other consists of unrelated individuals. Results indicate that our method outperforms widely used methods for performing quality control on variants such as VQSR of GATK by considerably improving the quality of variants to be included in the analysis. Our approach is also very efficient, and hence can be applied to large sequencing datasets. We conclude that combining a machine learning algorithm trained with sequencing quality information and the filtering approach is an effective approach to perform quality control on genetic variants from sequencing data.Author SummaryGenetic disorders can be caused by many types of genetic mutations, including common and rare single nucleotide variants, structural variants, insertions and deletions. Nowadays, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to identify various genetic variants that are associated with diseases. However, variants detected by NGS might have poor sequencing quality due to biases and errors in sequencing technologies and analysis tools. Therefore, it is critical to remove variants with low quality, which could cause spurious findings in follow-up analyses. Previously, people applied either hard filters or machine learning models for variant quality control (QC), which failed to filter out those variants accurately. Here, we developed a statistical tool, ForestQC, for variant QC by combining a filtering approach and a machine learning approach. We applied ForestQC to one family-based whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset and one general case-control WGS dataset, to evaluate our method. Results show that ForestQC outperforms widely used methods for variant QC by considerably improving the quality of variants. Also, ForestQC is very efficient and scalable to large-scale sequencing datasets. Our study indicates that combining filtering approaches and machine learning approaches enables effective variant QC.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"ForestQC quality control on genetic variants from next-generation sequencing data using random forest, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/forestqc_quality_control_on_genetic_variants_from_next-generation_sequencing_data_using_random_forest_49799989/"},{"date":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","description":"Genomes can vary within individual organisms. Programmed DNA elimination leads to dramatic changes in genome organisation during the germline-soma differentiation of ciliates, lampreys, nematodes, and various other eukaryotes. A particularly remarkable example of tissue-specific genome differentiation is the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) in the zebra finch which is consistently absent from somatic cells. Although the zebra finch is an important animal model system, molecular evidence from its large GRC (\u0026gt;150 megabases) is limited to a short intergenic region and a single mRNA. Here, we combined cytogenetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic evidence to resolve the evolutionary origin and functional significance of the GRC. First, by generating tissue-specific de-novo linked-read genome assemblies and re-sequencing two additional germline and soma samples, we found that the GRC contains at least 115 genes which are paralogous to single-copy genes on 18 autosomes and the Z chromosome. We detected an amplification of 38 GRC-linked genes into high copy numbers (up to 308 copies) but, surprisingly, no enrichment of transposable elements on the GRC. Second, transcriptome and proteome data provided evidence for functional expression of GRC genes at the RNA and protein levels in testes and ovaries. Interestingly, the GRC is enriched for genes with highly expressed orthologs in chicken gonads and gene ontologies involved in female gonad development. Third, we detected evolutionary strata of GRC-linked genes. Genes such as bicc1 and trim71 have resided on the GRC for tens of millions of years, whereas dozens have become GRC-linked very recently. The GRC is thus likely widespread in songbirds (half of all bird species) and its rapid evolution may have contributed to their diversification. Together, our results demonstrate a highly dynamic evolutionary history of the songbird GRC leading to dramatic germline-soma genome differences as a novel mechanism to minimize genetic conflict between germline and soma.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Programmed DNA elimination of germline development genes in songbirds, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/programmed_dna_elimination_of_germline_development_genes_in_songbirds_49787910/"},{"date":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBackgroundIn recent years, research on cancer predisposition germline variants has emerged as a prominent field. The identity of somatic mutations is based on a reliable mapping of the patient germline variants. In addition, the statistics of germline variants frequencies in healthy individuals and cancer patients is the basis for seeking candidates for cancer predisposition genes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the main sources of such data, providing a diverse collection of molecular data including deep sequencing for more than 30 types of cancer from \u0026gt;10,000 patients.MethodsOur hypothesis in this study is that whole exome sequences from healthy blood samples of cancer patients are not expected to show systematic differences among cancer types. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed common and rare germline variants across six cancer types, covering 2,241 samples from TCGA. In our analysis we accounted for inherent variables in the data including the different variant calling protocols, sequencing platforms, and ethnicity.ResultsWe report on substantial batch effects in germline variants associated with cancer types. We attribute the effect to the specific sequencing centers that produced the data. Specifically, we measured 30% variability in the number of reported germline variants per sample across sequencing centers. The batch effect is further expressed in nucleotide composition and variant frequencies. Importantly, the batch effect causes substantial differences in germline variant distribution patterns across numerous genes, including prominent cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, RET, MAX, and KRAS. For most of known cancer predisposition genes, we found a distinct batch-dependent difference in germline variants.ConclusionTCGA germline data is exposed to strong batch effects with substantial variabilities among TCGA sequencing centers. We claim that those batch effects are consequential for numerous TCGA pan-cancer studies. In particular, these effects may compromise the reliability and the potency to detect new cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, interpretation of pan-cancer analyses should be revisited in view of the source of the genomic data after accounting for the reported batch effects.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Substantial Batch Effects in TCGA Exome Sequences Undermine Pan-Cancer Analysis of Germline Variants, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/substantial_batch_effects_in_tcga_exome_sequences_undermine_pan-cancer_analysis_of_germline_variants_49805511/"},{"date":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","description":"Studying and characterising tumour cell migration is critical for understanding disease progression and for assessing drug efficacy.

We examined scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic features also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length.

Among these were very long gene length, due to large introns highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like LINEs, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale shark’s genome had an expansion of gene families related to fatty acid metabolism and neurogenesis, with the slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_framework_for_intelligence_and_cortical_function_based_on_grid_cells_in_the_neocortex_49622119/"},{"date":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","description":"Centrosome positioning relative to the nucleus and cell shape is highly regulated across cell types, during cell migration and during spindle formation in cell division.

Here, we uncover a role for PP2A-B55SUR-6 in regulating centrosome positioning. Mechanistically, PP2A-B55SUR-6 regulates nuclear size prior to mitotic entry, in turn affecting nuclear envelope-based Dynein density and motor capacity. Using computational simulations, PP2A-B55 SUR-6 regulation of nuclear size and nuclear envelope Dynein density were both predicted to be required for proper centrosome positioning. Conversely, compromising nuclear lamina integrity led to centrosome detachment from the nuclear envelope and migration defects. Removal of PP2A-B55SUR-6 and the nuclear lamina simultaneously further disrupted centrosome positioning, leading to unseparated centrosome pairs dissociated from the nuclear envelope.

The core assumption underlying these approaches is that the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency. Despite the importance of this assumption, it has not been rigorously tested.New methodWe introduce extensions of common approaches that are better suited for the physiological reality of how neural oscillations often manifest as nonstationary, high-power bursts, rather than sustained rhythms. Log-transforming, or taking the median power, significantly reduces erroneously inflated power estimates.ResultsAnalyzing 101 participants’ worth of human electrophysiology, totaling 3,560 channels and over 40 hours data, we show that, in all cases examined, spectral power is not Gaussian distributed. This is true even when oscillations are prominent and sustained, such as visual cortical alpha. Power across time, at every frequency, is characterized by a substantial long tail, which implies that estimates of average power are skewed toward large, infrequent high-power oscillatory bursts.Comparison with existing methodsIn a simulated event-related experiment we show how introducing just a few high-power oscillatory bursts, as seen in real data, can, perhaps erroneously, cause significant differences between conditions using traditional methods.

Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population variation (or population noise) and the correlation among characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate, especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals. Our results show that time estimates are affected by whether the correlations and population noise are accounted for or ignored in the analysis. The estimates are also affected by the type of data analysed, with analyses of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the autocorrelated-rates model. We suggest that using morphological continuous characters, together with molecular data, can bring a new perspective to the study of species evolution.

We reasoned that these ‘non-greedy’ decisions, instead of reflecting information seeking during choice, may be caused by computational noise in the learning of action values. Here, using reinforcement learning (RL) models of behavior and multimodal neurophysiological data, we show that the majority of non-greedy decisions stems from this learning noise. The trial-to-trial variability of sequential learning steps and their impact on behavior could be predicted both by BOLD responses to obtained rewards in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and by phasic pupillary dilation – suggestive of neuromodulatory fluctuations driven by the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Together, these findings indicate that most of behavioral variability, rather than reflecting human exploration, is due to the limited computational precision of reward-guided learning.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Computational noise in reward-guided learning drives behavioral variability in volatile environments, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/computational_noise_in_reward-guided_learning_drives_behavioral_variability_in_volatile_environments_49514103/"},{"date":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","description":"Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are poised to improve biomedical outcomes via precision medicine. However, the major ethical and scientific challenge surrounding clinical implementation is that they are many-fold more accurate in European ancestry individuals than others. This disparity is an inescapable consequence of Eurocentric genome-wide association study biases. This highlights that--unlike clinical biomarkers and prescription drugs, which may individually work better in some populations but do not ubiquitously perform far better in European populations--clinical uses of PRS today would systematically afford greater improvement to European descent populations. Early diversifying efforts show promise in levelling this vast imbalance, even when non-European sample sizes are considerably smaller than the largest studies to date.

We develop the ancestry double generalized linear model (ADGLM), a statistical framework to jointly model population mean and variance effects. We apply ADGLM to several deeply phenotyped datasets and observe ancestry-variance associations with 12 of 44 tested traits in ~113K British individuals and 3 of 14 tested traits in ~3K Mexican, Puerto Rican, and African-American individuals. We show through extensive simulations that population variance structure can both bias and reduce the power of genetic association studies, even when principal components or linear mixed models are used. ADGLM corrects this bias and improves power relative to previous methods in both simulated and real datasets.

For many TRs, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a VNTR in ABCA7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the TR size and sequence directly on raw PromethION current data.We report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh DNA extractions, DNA shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All ABCA7 VNTR alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of TR length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, DNA strand effects andor inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel NanoSatellite algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw PromethION current data, achieved more than 90% accuracy and high precision (5.6% relative standard deviation) of TR length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative TR sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of TR sequence and distinction of VNTR alleles with homozygous length.In conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded ABCA7 VNTR alleles in Alzheimer’s disease, and opening new opportunities for TR research.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Accurate characterization of expanded tandem repeat length and sequence through whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/accurate_characterization_of_expanded_tandem_repeat_length_and_sequence_through_whole_genome_long-read_sequencing_on_promethion_49422509/"},{"date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractUnderstanding hybrid incompatibilities is a fundamental pursuit in evolutionary genetics. In crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males, the interaction of at least three genes is necessary for hybrid male lethality Hmr mel, Lhr sim, and gfzf sim. All three hybrid incompatibility genes are chromatin associated factors. While HMR and LHR physically bind each other and function together in a single complex, the connection between either of these proteins and gfzf remains mysterious. Here, we investigate the allele specific chromatin binding patterns of gfzf. First, our cytological analyses show that there is little difference in protein localization of GFZF between the two species except at telomeric sequences. In particular, GFZF binds the telomeric retrotransposon repeat arrays, and the differential binding of GFZF at telomeres reflects the rapid changes in sequence composition at telomeres between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Second, we investigate the patterns of GFZF and HMR co-localization and find that the two proteins do not normally co-localize in D. melanogaster. However, in inter-species hybrids, HMR shows extensive mis-localization to GFZF sites, and this altered localization requires the presence of gfzf sim. Third, we find by ChIP-Seq that over-expression of HMR and LHR within species is sufficient to cause HMR to mis-localize to GFZF binding sites, indicating that HMR has a natural low affinity for GFZF sites. Together, these studies provide the first insights into the different properties of gfzf between D. melanogaster and D. simulans as well as a molecular interaction between gfzf and Hmr in the form of altered protein localization.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Altered chromatin localization of hybrid lethality proteins in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/altered_chromatin_localization_of_hybrid_lethality_proteins_in_drosophila_49389027/"},{"date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractObjectivesModern humans are thought to have interbred with Neanderthals in the Near East soon after modern humans dispersed out of Africa.

Most cells are infected by virions with defects such as amino-acid mutations, internal deletions, or failure to express a gene. We identify instances of each type of defect that increase the likelihood that a cell activates an innate-immune response. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects, and sometimes occurs even when a cell is infected by a virion that expresses unmutated copies of all genes. Our work shows that viral genetic variation substantially contributes to but does not fully explain the heterogeneity in single influenza-infected cells.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Single-cell virus sequencing of influenza infections that trigger innate immunity, bioRxiv, 2018-10-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/single-cell_virus_sequencing_of_influenza_infections_that_trigger_innate_immunity_49343272/"},{"date":"2018-10-07T00:00:00Z","description":"Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes requires passage of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through chromatin. Pol II passage is impaired by nucleosomes and requires elongation factors that help Pol II to efficiently overcome the nucleosomal barrier1-4. How the Pol II machinery transcribes through a nucleosome remains unclear because structural studies have been limited to Pol II elongation complexes formed on DNA templates lacking nucleosomes5. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of transcribing Pol II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae engaged with a downstream nucleosome core particle (NCP) at an overall resolution of 4.4 Å with resolutions ranging from 4-6 Å in Pol II and 6-8 Å in the NCP. Pol II and the NCP adopt a defined orientation that could not be predicted from modelling. Pol II contacts DNA of the incoming NCP on both sides of the nucleosomal dyad with its domains ‘clamp head’ and ‘lobe’. Comparison of the Pol II-NCP structure to known structures of Pol II complexes reveals that the elongation factors TFIIS, DSIF, NELF, PAF1 complex, and SPT6 can be accommodated on the Pol II surface in the presence of the oriented nucleosome. Further structural comparisons show that the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1, which is also required for efficient Pol II passage6,7, could bind the oriented nucleosome with its motor domain. The DNA-binding region of Chd1 must however be released from DNA when Pol II approaches the nucleosome, and based on published data8,9 this is predicted to stimulate Chd1 activity and to facilitate Pol II passage. Our results provide a starting point for a mechanistic analysis of chromatin transcription.","tags":["biorxiv","biochemistry","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Structure of transcribing RNA polymerase II-nucleosome complex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/structure_of_transcribing_rna_polymerase_ii-nucleosome_complex_49346096/"},{"date":"2018-10-06T00:00:00Z","description":"Imaging changes in membrane potential using genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) has great potential for monitoring neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Moreover, some applications cannot utilise pre-aligned reads at all, necessitating conversion back to raw format (FASTQ) before they can be used.

Through eliminating steps and increasing the accessible concurrency, Bazam facilitates up to a 90% reduction in the time required for realignment compared to standard methods. Bazam can support selective extraction of read pairs from focused genomic regions, further increasing efficiency for targeted analyses.

Screening 46 candidate genes for astrocyte diversity across the cortex, we identified grey matter superficial, mid and deep astrocyte identities in gradient layer patterns that were distinct from neurons. Astrocyte layers formed in early postnatal cortex and mostly persisted in adult mouse and human cortex. Mutations that shifted neuronal post-mitotic identity or organization were sufficient to alter glial layering, indicating an instructive role for neuronal cues. In normal mouse cortex, astrocyte layer patterns showed area diversity between functionally distinct cortical regions.

Quiescent CENP-A incorporation involves the canonical CENP-A deposition machinery, but displays distinct requirements from cell cycle-dependent deposition. We demonstrate that Plk1 is required specifically for G1 CENP-A deposition, whereas transcription promotes CENP-A incorporation in quiescent oocytes. Preventing CENP-A deposition during quiescence results in significantly reduced CENP-A levels and perturbs chromosome segregation following the resumption of cell division.

In fact, sequence data mapping to repeat elements are often discarded from analysis pipelines. Therefore, there is a continued need for standardized tools and techniques to interpret genomic data of repeats.ResultsWe present the UCSC Repeat Browser, which consists of a complete set of human repeat reference sequences derived from the gold standard repeat database RepeatMasker.

Faithful DSB repair using the homologous chromosome is essential for fertility, yielding either non-crossovers, which are frequent but difficult to detect, or crossovers. In certain hybrid mice, high sequence divergence causes PRDM9 to bind each homologue at different sites, 'asymmetrically', and these mice exhibit meiotic failure and infertility, by unknown mechanisms. To investigate the impact of local sequence divergence on recombination, we intercrossed two mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequenced 119 offspring, whose high heterozygosity allowed detection of thousands of crossover and non-crossover events with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. Both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at individual asymmetric sites, revealing that PRDM9 not only positions DSBs but also promotes their homologous repair by binding to the unbroken homologue at each site. Unexpectedly, we found that non-crossovers containing multiple mismatches repair by a different mechanism than single-mismatch sites, which undergo GC-biased gene conversion.

ELGH combines health data science (using linked UK National Health Service (NHS) electronic health record data) with exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping to elucidate the genetic influence on health and disease, including the contribution from high rates of parental relatedness on rare genetic variation and homozygosity (autozygosity), in two understudied ethnic groups. Linkage to longitudinal health record data enables both retrospective and prospective analyses. Through Stage 2 studies, ELGH offers researchers the opportunity to undertake recall-by-genotype andor recall-by-phenotype studies on volunteers. Sub-cohort, trial-within-cohort, and other study designs are possible.

Here, akin to a chain reaction, we present the discovery of hydrodynamic trigger waves in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum, propagating hundreds of times faster than the swimming speed. Coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 50% within milliseconds, with accelerations reaching 14g-forces. Surprisingly, a single cellular contraction (transmitter) is shown to generate long-ranged vortex flows at intermedi- ate Reynolds numbers, which can trigger neighbouring cells, in turn. To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals (receiver), we further present a high-throughput suction-flow device to probe mechanosensitive ion channel gating by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell mem- brane. These ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves are analysed and modelled quantitatively in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory. A phase transition is revealed, requiring a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help organise cohabiting communities over large distances, influencing long-term behaviour through gene expression, comparable to quorum sensing. More immediately, as contractions release toxins, synchronised discharges could also facilitate the repulsion of large predators, or conversely immobilise large prey. We postulate that beyond protists numerous other freshwater and marine organisms could coordinate with variations of hydrodynamic trigger waves.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Collective intercellular communication through ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves, bioRxiv, 2018-09-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/collective_intercellular_communication_through_ultra-fast_hydrodynamic_trigger_waves_48929251/"},{"date":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractNematodes belong to one of the most diverse animal phyla.

The use of plasmids with selection markers is an effective methodology, but often requires laborious and complicated cloning steps. We have established a cloning-free ribonucleoprotein-driven Nested CRISPR method that robustly produces endogenous fluorescent reporters. This methodology is based on the division of the GFP and mCherry sequences in three fragments. In the first step we use ssDNA donors (≤200 bp) to insert 5’ and 3’ fragments in the place of interest. In the second step, we use these sequences as homology regions for Homology Directed Repair (HDR) with a dsDNA donor (PCR product, ≈700 bp) including the middle fragment, thus completing the fluorescent protein sequence. This method is advantageous because the first step with ssDNA donors is known to be very efficient, and the second step, uses universal reagents, including validated PCR products and crRNAs, to create fluorescent reporters reaching reliable editing efficiencies as high as 40%. We have also used Nested CRISPR in a non-essential gene to produce a deletion mutant in the first step and a transcriptional reporter in the second step.In the search of modifications to optimize the method, we tested synthetic sgRNAs, but we did not observe a significant increase in the efficacy compared to independently adding tracrRNA and crRNA to the injection mix. Conveniently, we also found that both steps of Nested CRISPR could be performed in a single injection.

We develop a novel MK-based method (ABC-MK) to infer adaptation rate and strength, and estimate alpha=0.135 in human protein-coding sequences, 72% of which is contributed by weakly adaptive variants. We show that in this adaptation regime alpha is reduced approx. 25% by linkage genome-wide. Moreover, we show that virus-interacting proteins (VIPs) undergo adaptation that is both stronger and nearly twice as frequent as the genome average (alpha=0.224, 56% due to strongly-beneficial alleles).

This estimate is much higher than previous estimates, which did not account for the population size of the outgroup species. Next, we directly estimate the proportion and selection coefficients of newly arising strongly beneficial nonsynonymous mutations in humans, mice, and D. melanogaster by examining patterns of polymorphism and divergence. We develop a novel composite likelihood framework to test whether these parameters differ across species. Overall, we reject a model with the same proportion and the same selection coefficients of beneficial mutations across species, and estimate that humans have a higher proportion of beneficial mutations compared to Drosophila and mice. We demonstrate that this result cannot be attributed to biased gene conversion. In summary, we find the proportion of beneficial mutations is higher in humans than in D. melanogaster or mice, suggesting that organismal complexity, which increases the number of steps required in adaptive walks, may be a key predictor of the amount of adaptive evolution within a species.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Stronger and higher proportion of beneficial amino acid changing mutations in humans compared to mice and flies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/stronger_and_higher_proportion_of_beneficial_amino_acid_changing_mutations_in_humans_compared_to_mice_and_flies_48909889/"},{"date":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractLanguage diversity is distributed unevenly over the globe.

Here we present the first global analysis of language diversity that identifies the relative importance of two key ecological mechanisms suggested to promote language diversification - isolation and ecological risk - after correcting for spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetic non-independence. We find significant effects of climate on language diversity consistent with the ecological risk hypothesis that areas of high year-round productivity lead to more languages by supporting human cultural groups with smaller distributions. Climate has a much stronger effect on language diversity than landscape features that might contribute to isolation of cultural groups, such as altitudinal variation, river density, or landscape roughness. The association between biodiversity and language diversity appears to be an incidental effect of their covariation with climate, rather than a causal link between the two. While climate and landscape provide strong explanatory signal for variation in language diversity, we identify a number of areas of high unexplained language diversity, with more languages than would be predicted from environmental features alone; notably New Guinea, the Himalayan foothills, West Africa, and Mesoamerica.

Previously, we argued that these patterns conﬂict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated – as seems likely – then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes.

Theory predicts that the evolution of giants should be constrained by two tradeoffs. First, because body size is negatively correlated with population size, purifying selection is expected to be less efficient in species of large body size, leading to a genome-wide elevation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dNdS) or mutation load. Second, gigantism is achieved through higher number of cells and higher rates of cell proliferation, thus increasing the likelihood of cancer. However, the incidence of cancer in gigantic animals is lower than the theoretical expectation, a phenomenon referred to as Peto’s Paradox. To explore the genetic basis of gigantism in rodents and uncover genomic signatures of gigantism-related tradeoffs, we sequenced the genome of the capybara, the world’s largest living rodent. We found that dNdS is elevated genome wide in the capybara, relative to other rodents, implying a higher mutation load. Conversely, a genome-wide scan for adaptive protein evolution in the capybara highlighted several genes involved in growth regulation by the insulininsulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Capybara-specific gene-family expansions included a putative novel anticancer adaptation that involves T cell-mediated tumor suppression, offering a potential resolution to Peto’s Paradox in this lineage. Gene interaction network analyses also revealed that size regulators function simultaneously as growth factors and oncogenes, creating an evolutionary conflict. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that gigantism in the capybara likely involved three evolutionary steps 1) Increase in body size by cell proliferation through the ISS pathway, 2) coupled evolution of growth-regulatory and cancer-suppression mechanisms, possibly driven by intragenomic conflict, and 3) establishment of the T cell-mediated tumor suppression pathway as an anticancer adaptation. Interestingly, increased mutation load appears to be an inevitable outcome of an increase in body size.Author SummaryThe existence of gigantic animals presents an evolutionary puzzle. Larger animals have more cells and undergo exponentially more cell divisions, thus, they should have enormous rates of cancer. Moreover, large animals also have smaller populations making them vulnerable to extinction. So, how do gigantic animals such as elephants and blue whales protect themselves from cancer, and what are the consequences of evolving a large size on the ‘genetic health’ of a species? To address these questions we sequenced the genome of the capybara, the world’s largest rodent, and performed comparative genomic analyses to identify the genes and pathways involved in growth regulation and cancer suppression.

Using data from large-scale genomic datasets, we demonstrate that PCA-UMAP effectively clusters closely related individuals while placing them in a global continuum of genetic variation. This approach reveals previously overlooked subpopulations within the American Hispanic population and fine-scale relationships between geography, genotypes, and phenotypes in the UK population.

A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called ‘off-targets’ by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that ‘high-fidelity’ variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants.

While it is well recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility6,7, it is not known if interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that impact gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope surrounding the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts the tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. Furthermore, this localized attachment is mediated by a specific integrin, and its knock-down leads to a gastrulation phenotype consistent with complete loss of attachment. Moreover, analysis of another integrin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline.

In analyses of 33 complex traits (average N=361k), we determined that common variants are ∼4x more polygenic than low-frequency variants, consistent with pervasive flattening. Moreover, functionally important regions of the genome have increased polygenicity in proportion to their increased heritability, implying that heritability enrichment reflects differences in the number of associations rather than their magnitude (which is constrained by selection).

Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold—a space of possible network states. The manifold’s structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Probing variability in a cognitive map using manifold inference from neural dynamics, bioRxiv, 2018-09-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/probing_variability_in_a_cognitive_map_using_manifold_inference_from_neural_dynamics_48504340/"},{"date":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryAfter we listen to a series of words, we can silently replay them in our mind.

We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at single desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells such that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through the local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation.

We hypothesised that genetic variants related to alcohol consumption may, via their effect on alcohol behaviour, influence mate selection.Therefore, in a sample of over 47,000 spouse-pairs in the UK Biobank we utilised a well-characterised alcohol related variant, rs1229984 in ADH1B, as a genetic proxy for alcohol use. We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individual’s self-reported alcohol use and their partner’s rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.We found strong evidence that both an individual’s self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partner’s self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individual’s weekly alcohol consumption increased their partner’s alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10×10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation.

Remarkably, some bacteria have exploited the destructive properties of phage genes for their own benefit by co-opting them as toxins for functions related to bacterial warfare, virulence, and secretion. However, do toxic phage genes ever become raw material for functional innovation? Here we report on a toxic phage gene whose product has lost its toxicity and has become a domain of a core cellular factor, SpmX, throughout the bacterial order Caulobacterales. Using a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, structural biology, cell biology, and biochemistry, we have investigated the origin and function of SpmX and determined that its occurrence is the result of the detoxification of a phage peptidoglycan hydrolase gene. We show that the retained, attenuated activity of the phage-derived domain plays an important role in proper cell morphology and developmental regulation in representatives of this large bacterial clade.

A possible approach to dissect biological heterogeneity is to look for biologically meaningful subtypes. A recent study Drysdale et al.

These subtypes were predictive of treatment response to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.ObjectiveHere, we attempted to replicate the procedure followed in the Drysdale et al. study and their findings in an independent dataset of a clinically more heterogeneous sample of 187 participants with depression and anxiety. We aimed to answer the following questions 1) Using the same procedure, can we find a statistically significant and reliable relationship between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms? 2) Is the observed relationship similar to the one found in the original study? 3) Can we identify distinct and reliable subtypes? 4) Do they have similar clinical profiles as the subtypes identified in the original study?MethodsWe followed the original procedure as closely as possible, including a canonical correlation analysis to find a low dimensional representation of clinically relevant resting state fMRI features, followed by hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes. We extended the original procedure using additional statistical tests, to test the statistical significance of the relationship between resting state fMRI and clinical data, and the existence of distinct subtypes. Furthermore, we examined the stability of the whole procedure using resampling.Results and ConclusionWe were not able to replicate the findings of the original study. Relationships between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms were not statistically significant and we also did not find clearly distinct subtypes of depression.

The reconstruction of the species tree from molecular data is hindered by frequent conflicts between gene genealogies. A standard way of dealing with this issue is to postulate the existence of a unique species tree where disagreements between gene trees are explained by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) due to random coalescences of gene lineages inside the edges of the species tree. This paradigm, known as the multi-species coalescent (MSC), is constantly violated by the ubiquitous presence of gene flow revealed by empirical studies, leading to topological incongruences of gene trees that cannot be explained by ILS alone. Here we argue that this paradigm should be revised in favor of a vision acknowledging the importance of gene flow and where gene histories shape the species tree rather than the opposite. We propose a new, plastic framework for modeling the joint evolution of gene and species lineages relaxing the hierarchy between the species tree and gene trees. We implement this framework in two mathematical models called the gene-based diversification models (GBD) 1) GBD-forward, following all evolving genomes and thus very intensive computationally and 2) GBD-backward, based on coalescent theory and thus more efficient. Each model features four parameters tuning colonization, mutation, gene flow and reproductive isolation. We propose a quick inference method based on the differences between gene trees and use it to evaluate the amount of gene flow in two empirical data-sets. We find that in these data-sets, gene tree distributions are better explained by the best fitting GBD model than by the best fitting MSC model.

By leveraging the semantics of how researchers within each field describe their studies, this framework enables region to region mapping of brain regions across species, as well as cross-species mapping of psychological functions. As a proof of concept, we utilize the framework to create a functional cross-species mapping between the amygdala and hippocampus for fear-related and spatial memories, respectively. We then proceed to address two open questions in the field (1) Do rodents have a dorsolateral prefrontal cortex? (2) Which human brain region corresponds to the rodent prelimbic cortex?","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"A data-driven approach to the automated study of cross-species homologies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_data-driven_approach_to_the_automated_study_of_cross-species_homologies_48009392/"},{"date":"2018-09-07T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryEssential features of cancer tissue cellular heterogeneity such as negatively selected genome topologies, sub-clonal mutation patterns and genome replication states can only effectively be studied by sequencing single-cell genomes at scale and high fidelity. Using an amplification-free single-cell genome sequencing approach implemented on commodity hardware (DLP+) coupled with a cloud-based computational platform, we define a resource of 40,000 single-cell genomes characterized by their genome states, across a wide range of tissue types and conditions. We show that shallow sequencing across thousands of genomes permits reconstruction of clonal genomes to single nucleotide resolution through aggregation analysis of cells sharing higher order genome structure. From large-scale population analysis over thousands of cells, we identify rare cells exhibiting mitotic mis-segregation of whole chromosomes. We observe that tissue derived scWGS libraries exhibit lower rates of whole chromosome anueploidy than cell lines, and loss of p53 results in a shift in event type, but not overall prevalence in breast epithelium. Finally, we demonstrate that the replication states of genomes can be identified, allowing the number and proportion of replicating cells, as well as the chromosomal pattern of replication to be unambiguously identified in single-cell genome sequencing experiments.

ANNs that are most functionally similar to the brain will contain mechanisms that are most like those used by the brain. We therefore developed Brain-Score – a composite of multiple neural and behavioral benchmarks that score any ANN on how similar it is to the brain’s mechanisms for core object recognition – and we deployed it to evaluate a wide range of state-of-the-art deep ANNs. Using this scoring system, we here report that (1) DenseNet-169, CORnet-S and ResNet-101 are the most brain-like ANNs. (2) There remains considerable variability in neural and behavioral responses that is not predicted by any ANN, suggesting that no ANN model has yet captured all the relevant mechanisms. (3) Extending prior work, we found that gains in ANN ImageNet performance led to gains on Brain-Score. However, correlation weakened at ≥ 70% top-1 ImageNet performance, suggesting that additional guidance from neuroscience is needed to make further advances in capturing brain mechanisms. (4) We uncovered smaller (i.e. less complex) ANNs that are more brain-like than many of the best-performing ImageNet models, which suggests the opportunity to simplify ANNs to better understand the ventral stream. The scoring system used here is far from complete. However, we propose that evaluating and tracking model-benchmark correspondences through a Brain-Score that is regularly updated with new brain data is an exciting opportunity experimental benchmarks can be used to guide machine network evolution, and machine networks are mechanistic hypotheses of the brain’s network and thus drive next experiments.

Addressing these questions, we analyzed genome-wide CRISPR and RNAi screens to systematically chart the mutation selection potential of CRISPR knockouts across the whole exome. Our analysis suggests that CRISPR gene editing can select for mutants of KRAS and VHL, at a level comparable to that reported for p53.

Finally, we performed a new set of pooled and arrayed CRISPR screens to evaluate the competition between CRISPR-edited isogenic p53 WT and mutant cell lines, which further validated our predictions.

However, some pathogen strains invoke immune responses that provide partial cross-immunity against infection with related strains. Here, we consider a mathematical model of successive outbreaks of two strains a low virulence strain outbreak followed by a high virulence strain outbreak. Under these circumstances, we investigate the impacts of varying travel rates and cross-immunity on the probability that a major epidemic of the high virulence strain occurs, and the size of that outbreak. Frequent travel between subpopulations can lead to widespread immunity to the high virulence strain, driven by exposure to the low virulence strain. As a result, major epidemics of the high virulence strain are less likely, and can potentially be smaller, with more connected subpopulations.

However, the generation of conditional knockout alleles remains an important challenge. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout alleles in mice using 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) (2sgRNA-2ssODN). We re-evaluated this method from a large data set generated from a consortium consisting of 17 transgenic core facilities or laboratories or programs across the world. The dataset constituted 17,887 microinjected or electroporated zygotes and 1,718 live born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice harbored 2 correct LoxP insertions in cis configuration indicating a very low efficiency of the method. To determine the factors required to successfully generate conditional alleles using the 2sgRNA-2ssODN approach, we performed a generalized linear regression model. We show that factors such as the concentration of the sgRNA, Cas9 protein or the distance between the placement of LoxP insertions were not predictive for the success of this technique. The major predictor affecting the method’s success was the probability of simultaneously inserting intact proximal and distal LoxP sequences, without the loss of the DNA segment between the two sgRNA cleavage sites. Our analysis of a large data set indicates that the 2sgRNA–2ssODN method generates a large number of undesired alleles (\u0026gt;99%), and a very small number of desired alleles (\u0026lt;1%) requiring, on average 1,192 zygotes.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Re-Evaluating One-step Generation of Mice Carrying Conditional Alleles by CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing Technology, bioRxiv, 2018-08-31","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/re-evaluating_one-step_generation_of_mice_carrying_conditional_alleles_by_crispr-cas9-mediated_genome_editing_technology_47288281/"},{"date":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe fairness of scholarly peer review has been challenged by evidence of disparities in publication outcomes based on author demographic characteristics.

Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained.

Despite its economic and cultural importance, a high-quality reference genome is currently lacking, and the group’s evolutionary history is not fully resolved. To address these gaps, we used long-read nanopore sequencing and assembled the genomes of two circum-basmati rice varieties, Basmati 334 and Dom Sufid.RESULTSWe generated two high-quality, chromosome-level reference genomes that represented the 12 chromosomes of Oryza. The assemblies showed a contig N50 of 6.32Mb and 10.53Mb for Basmati 334 and Dom Sufid, respectively. Using our highly contiguous assemblies we characterized structural variations segregating across circum-basmati genomes. We discovered repeat expansions not observed in japonica—the rice group most closely related to circum- basmati—as well as presenceabsence variants of over 20Mb, one of which was a circum- basmati-specific deletion of a gene regulating awn length. We further detected strong evidence of admixture between the circum-basmati and circum-aus groups. This gene flow had its greatest effect on chromosome 10, causing both structural variation and single nucleotide polymorphism to deviate from genome-wide history. Lastly, population genomic analysis of 78 circum-basmati varieties showed three major geographically structured genetic groups (1) BhutanNepal group, (2) IndiaBangladeshMyanmar group, and (3) IranPakistan group.CONCLUSIONAvailability of high-quality reference genomes from nanopore sequencing allowed functional and evolutionary genomic analyses, providing genome-wide evidence for gene flow between circum-aus and circum-basmati, the nature of circum-basmati structural variation, and the presenceabsence of genes in this important and iconic rice variety group.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Nanopore-based genome assembly and the evolutionary genomics of basmati rice, bioRxiv, 2018-08-20","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/nanopore-based_genome_assembly_and_the_evolutionary_genomics_of_basmati_rice_46753663/"},{"date":"2018-08-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSNP datasets are high-dimensional, often with thousands to millions of SNPs and hundreds to thousands of samples or individuals.

Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPRCas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout.

Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults.MethodsDuring a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking, and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were manifested.ResultsWe found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected.ConclusionWhile this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility.

These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time.

Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that “sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.” Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median’s bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations.

The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with a broad consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on reform’s specific nature, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and evaluate their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to shift the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets.

The absence of some fungal enzymes necessary for cathinone and psilocybin biosynthesis along with the inability to detect intermediate metabolites or gene orthologs are consistent with possibly novel biosynthesis pathways in Massospora.

One way this can be achieved is through “speed breeding” (SB), which shortens the breeding cycle and accelerates research studies through rapid generation advancement. The SB method can be carried out in a number of ways, one of which involves extending the duration of a plant’s daily exposure to light (photoperiod) combined with early seed harvest in order to cycle quickly from seed to seed, thereby reducing the generation times for some long-day (LD) or day-neutral crops. Here we present glasshouse and growth chamber-based SB protocols with supporting data from experimentation with several crop species. These protocols describe the growing conditions, including soil media composition, lighting, temperature and spacing, which promote rapid growth of spring and winter bread wheat, durum wheat, barley, oat, various members of the Brassica family, chickpea, pea, grasspea, quinoa and the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Points of flexibility within the protocols are highlighted, including how plant density can be increased to efficiently scale-up plant numbers for single seed descent (SSD) purposes. Conversely, instructions on how to perform SB on a small-scale by creating a benchtop SB growth cabinet that enables optimization of parameters at a low cost are provided.

Single splicing events have been described for \u0026lt;=200 single cells with great statistical success14,15, but these methods do not describe full-length mRNAs. Single cell short-read 3’ sequencing has allowed identification of many cell sub-types16–23, but full-length isoforms for these cell types have not been profiled. Using our new method of single-cell-isoform-RNA-sequencing (ScISOr-Seq) we determine isoform-expression in thousands of individual cells from a heterogeneous bulk tissue (cerebellum), without specific antibody-fluorescence activated cell sorting. We elucidate isoform usage in high-level cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and microglia and finer sub-types, such as Purkinje cells and Granule cells, including the combination patterns of distant splice sites6–9,24,25, which for individual molecules requires long reads.

In step three, an aliquot of the same cDNAs (each barcoded for the individual cell of origin) is sequenced using Pacific Biosciences (“PacBio”)1,2,4,5,26 or Oxford Nanopore3. Since these long reads carry the single-cell barcodes identified in step two, one can determine the individual cell from which each long read originates.

The conclusions are supported by cell-autonomous studies in the offspring that demonstrate an enhanced capacity to form mature active brown adipocytes, improved neuronal density and more norepinephrine release in BAT in response to cold stimulation.

We aimed to validate a novel aging measure, “Phenotypic Age”, constructed based on routine clinical chemistry measures, by assessing its applicability for differentiating risk for morbidity and mortality in both healthy and unhealthy populations of various ages.MethodsA nationally representative US sample, NHANES III, was used to derive “Phenotypic Age” based on a linear combination of chronological age and nine multi-system clinical chemistry measures, selected via cox proportional elastic net. Mortality predictions were validated using an independent sample (NHANES IV), consisting of 11,432 participants, for whom we observed a total of 871 deaths, ascertained over 12.6 year of follow-up. Proportional hazard models and ROC curves were used to evaluate predictions.ResultsPhenotypic Age was significantly associated with all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. These results were robust to age and sex stratification, and remained even when excluding short-term mortality. Similarly, Phenotypic Age was associated with mortality among seemingly “healthy” participants—defined as those who were disease-free and had normal BMI at baseline—as well as the oldest-old (aged 85+)—a group with high disease burden.ConclusionsPhenotypic Age is a reliable predictor of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in multiple subgroups of the population. Risk stratification by this composite measure is far superior to that of the individual measures that go into it, as well as traditional measures of health. It is able to differentiate individuals who appear healthy, who may have otherwise been missed using traditional health assessments. Further, it can differentiate risk among persons with shared disease burden.

Recently, a highly efficient gene drive was developed in insects, which leverages the sequence-targeted DNA cleavage activity of CRISPRCas9 and endogenous homology directed repair mechanisms to convert heterozygous genotypes to homozygosity. If implemented in laboratory rodents, this powerful system would enable the rapid assembly of genotypes that involve multiple genes (e.g., to model multigenic human diseases). Such complex genetic models are currently precluded by time, cost, and a requirement for a large number of animals to obtain a few individuals of the desired genotype. However, the efficiency of a CRISPRCas9 gene drive system in mammals has not yet been determined. Here, we utilize an active genetic “CopyCat” element embedded in the mouse Tyrosinase gene to detect genotype conversions after Cas9 activity in the embryo and in the germline. Although Cas9 efficiently induces double strand DNA breaks in the early embryo and is therefore highly mutagenic, these breaks are not resolved by homology directed repair. However, when Cas9 expression is limited to the developing female germline, resulting double strand breaks are resolved by homology directed repair that copies the CopyCat allele from the donor to the receiver chromosome and leads to its super-Mendelian inheritance. These results demonstrate that the CRISPRCas9 gene drive mechanism can be implemented to simplify complex genetic crosses in laboratory mice and also contribute valuable data to the ongoing debate about applications to combat invasive rodent populations in island communities.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Super-Mendelian inheritance mediated by CRISPRCas9 in the female mouse germline, bioRxiv, 2018-07-04","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/super-mendelian_inheritance_mediated_by_crisprcas9_in_the_female_mouse_germline_44494359/"},{"date":"2018-07-04T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTWith the widespread uptake of 2D and 3D single molecule localization microscopy, a large set of different data analysis packages have been developed to generate super-resolution images.

Neighborhood detection in gene expression space then identifies sequenced cells with increased probability of being doublets based on their proximity to artificial doublets. DoubletFinder robustly identifies doublets across scRNA-seq datasets with variable numbers of cells and sequencing depth, and predicts false-negative and false-positive doublets defined using conventional barcoding approaches.

However, the low quality of the reconstructed speech has severely limited the utility of this method for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex.

Specification of the visual field requires a highly-conserved eye development gene called eyeless in flies and Pax6 in humans. We discover that changes in the temporal regulation of eyeless expression during development is a conserved mechanism for sensory trade-offs within and between Drosophila species. We identify a natural single nucleotide polymorphism in the cis-regulatory region of eyeless that is sufficient to alter its temporal regulation and eye size.

Taken together, this suggests a hybrid optimization strategy for protein design in which a predictive model is used to explore difficult-to-access but promising regions of the fitness landscape that directed evolution can then exploit at scale.","tags":["biorxiv","synthetic-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Toward machine-guided design of proteins, bioRxiv, 2018-06-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/toward_machine-guided_design_of_proteins_43168022/"},{"date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe introduce alevin, a fast end-to-end pipeline to process droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing data, which performs cell barcode detection, read mapping, unique molecular identifier deduplication, gene count estimation, and cell barcode whitelisting.

To address this issue, we introduce a deep learning-based method for pose estimation, LEAP (LEAP Estimates Animal Pose). LEAP automatically predicts the positions of animal body parts using a deep convolutional neural network with as little as 10 frames of labeled data for training. This framework consists of a graphical interface for interactive labeling of body parts and software for training the network and fast prediction on new data (1 hr to train, 185 Hz predictions). We validate LEAP using videos of freely behaving fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and track 32 distinct points on the body to fully describe the pose of the head, body, wings, and legs with an error rate of \u0026lt;3% of the animal’s body length. We recapitulate a number of reported findings on insect gait dynamics and show LEAP’s applicability as the first step in unsupervised behavioral classification.

Here, we develop and analyze several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse that we show are not caused by loss of protein function. We find that the increase in transcript levels is due to enhanced transcription, and observe a correlation between the levels of mutant mRNA decay and transcriptional upregulation of related genes. To assess the role of mutant mRNA degradation in triggering transcriptional adaptation, we use genetic and pharmacological approaches and find that mRNA degradation is indeed required for this process. Notably, uncapped RNAs, themselves subjected to rapid degradation, can also induce transcriptional adaptation. Next, we generate alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene and find that they do not show transcriptional adaptation, and exhibit more severe phenotypes than those observed in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis of these different alleles reveals the upregulation of hundreds of genes with enrichment for those showing sequence similarity with the mutated gene’s mRNA, suggesting a model whereby mRNA degradation products induce the response via sequence similarity. These results expand the role of the mRNA surveillance machinery in buffering against mutations by triggering the transcriptional upregulation of related genes. Besides implications for our understanding of disease-causing mutations, our findings will help design mutant alleles with minimal transcriptional adaptation-derived compensation.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Genetic compensation is triggered by mutant mRNA degradation, bioRxiv, 2018-05-22","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/genetic_compensation_is_triggered_by_mutant_mrna_degradation_42383030/"},{"date":"2018-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Obtaining accurate sequences from long DNA molecules is very important for genome assembly and other applications.

To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube.

The order of assembly of genetic parts is determined by the ligation of flanking Watson-Crick base-paired overhangs. The ligation of mismatched overhangs leads to erroneous assembly, and the need to avoid such pairings has typically been accomplished by using small sets of empirically vetted junction pairs, limiting the number of parts that can be joined in a single reaction.

However, eQTL mapping and GWAS are limited in scope (to naturally occurring, common genetic variants) and resolution (by linkage disequilibrium). Here, we present crisprQTL mapping, a framework in which large numbers of CRISPRCas9 perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). crisprQTL mapping is analogous to conventional human eQTL studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells; genetic variants replaced by unique combinations of ‘unlinked’ guide RNA (gRNA)-programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue-level RNA-seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA-seq of many cells. By randomly introducing gRNAs, a single population of cells can be leveraged to test for association between each perturbation and the expression of any potential target gene, analogous to how eQTL studies leverage populations of humans to test millions of genetic variants for associations with expression in a genome-wide manner. However, crisprQTL mapping is neither limited to naturally occurring, common genetic variants nor by linkage disequilibrium. As a proof-of-concept, we applied crisprQTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean ‘allele frequency’ of 1.1% into a population of 47,650 profiled human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identified per cell).

We characterized movements using video and other sensors and measured neural activity using widefield and two-photon imaging. Cortex-wide activity was dominated by movements, especially uninstructed movements, reflecting unknown priorities of the animal. Some uninstructed movements were aligned to trial events. Accounting for them revealed that neurons with similar trial-averaged activity often reflected utterly different combinations of cognitive and movement variables. Other movements occurred idiosyncratically, accounting for trial-by-trial fluctuations that are often considered “noise”.

Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic “background” 1f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitationinhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters—along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth—are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Parameterizing neural power spectra, bioRxiv, 2018-04-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/parameterizing_neural_power_spectra_36573180/"},{"date":"2018-04-10T00:00:00Z","description":"The mammalian brain is composed of diverse, specialized cell populations, few of which we fully understand.

The challenge of VUS is epitomized by BRCA1, a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variants predispose women to early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of women, the risk associated with most newly observed variants cannot be definitively assigned. Data sharing attenuates this problem but it is unlikely to solve it, as most newly observed variants are exceedingly rare. In lieu of genetic evidence, experimental approaches can be used to functionally characterize VUS. However, to date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been conducted in a post hoc, piecemeal fashion. Here we employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode functionally critical domains of BRCA1. Our assay measures cellular fitness in a haploid human cell line whose survival is dependent on intact BRCA1 function. The resulting function scores for nearly 4,000 SNVs are bimodally distributed and almost perfectly concordant with established assessments of pathogenicity. Sequence-function maps enhanced by parallel measurements of variant effects on mRNA levels reveal mechanisms by which loss-of-function SNVs arise. Hundreds of missense SNVs critical for protein function are identified, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing or transcript stability. We predict that these function scores will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing.

Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.

This raises the need to explicitly model the resulting uncertainty and take it into account in any downstream analysis, such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and differential expression. Here, we introduce Single-cell Variational Inference (scVI), a scalable framework for probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in single cells. Our model uses variational inference and stochastic optimization of deep neural networks to approximate the parameters that govern the distribution of expression values of each gene in every cell, using a non-linear mapping between the observations and a low-dimensional latent space.By doing so, scVI pools information between similar cells or genes while taking nuisance factors of variation such as batch effects and limited sensitivity into account. To evaluate scVI, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis to existing methods for distributional modeling and dimensionality reduction, all of which rely on generalized linear models. We first show that scVI scales to over one million cells, whereas competing algorithms can process at most tens of thousands of cells. Next, we show that scVI fits unseen data more closely and can impute missing data more accurately, both indicative of a better generalization capacity. We then utilize scVI to conduct a set of fundamental analysis tasks – including batch correction, visualization, clustering and differential expression – and demonstrate its accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art tools in each task. scVI is publicly available, and can be readily used as a principled and inclusive solution for multiple tasks of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Bayesian Inference for a Generative Model of Transcriptome Profiles from Single-cell RNA Sequencing, bioRxiv, 2018-03-30","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/bayesian_inference_for_a_generative_model_of_transcriptome_profiles_from_single-cell_rna_sequencing_35017347/"},{"date":"2018-03-27T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractLong-read sequencing technologies are transforming our ability to assemble highly complex genomes.

The most common method is via a genetically-encoded sensor that responds to a small molecule (an “inducible system”). However, these sensors are often suboptimal, exhibiting high background expression and low dynamic range. Further, using multiple sensors in one cell is limited by cross-talk and the taxing of cellular resources. Here, we have developed a directed evolution strategy to simultaneously select for less background, high dynamic range, increased sensitivity, and low crosstalk. Libraries of the regulatory protein and output promoter are built based on random and rationally-guided mutations. This is applied to generate a set of 12 high-performance sensors, which exhibit \u0026gt;100-fold induction with low background and cross-reactivity.

Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary time-scales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions.

Recently there has been an increasing focus on studying genetic differentiation at fine geographic scales, such as within countries. Identifying such structure allows the study of recent population history, and identifies the potential for confounding in association studies, particularly when testing rare, often recently arisen variants. The Iberian Peninsula is linguistically diverse, has a complex demographic history, and is unique among European regions in having a centuries-long period of Muslim rule. Previous genetic studies of Spain have examined either a small fraction of the genome or only a few Spanish regions. Thus, the overall pattern of fine-scale population structure within Spain remains uncharacterised. Here we analyse genome-wide genotyping array data for 1,413 Spanish individuals sampled from all regions of Spain. We identify extensive fine-scale structure, down to unprecedented scales, smaller than 10 Km in some places. We observe a major axis of genetic differentiation that runs from east to west of the peninsula. In contrast, we observe remarkable genetic similarity in the north-south direction, and evidence of historical north-south population movement. Finally, without making particular prior assumptions about source populations, we show that modern Spanish people have regionally varying fractions of ancestry from a group most similar to modern north Moroccans. The north African ancestry results from an admixture event, which we date to 860 - 1120 CE, corresponding to the early half of Muslim rule.

Most barcode clustering reflects synonymous substitutions. What evolutionary mechanisms account for synonymous clusters being largely coincident with species? The answer depends on whether variants are phenotypically neutral. To the degree that variants are selectable, purifying selection limits variation within species and neighboring species may have distinct adaptive peaks. Phenotypically neutral variants are only subject to demographic processes—drift, lineage sorting, genetic hitchhiking, and bottlenecks. The evolution of modern humans has been studied from several disciplines with detail unique among animal species. Mitochondrial barcodes provide a commensurable way to compare modern humans to other animal species. Barcode variation in the modern human population is quantitatively similar to that within other animal species. Several convergent lines of evidence show that mitochondrial diversity in modern humans follows from sequence uniformity followed by the accumulation of largely neutral diversity during a population expansion that began approximately 100,000 years ago.

As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users.

Here we combine summary statistics from those two studies with GWAS of height and BMI performed in ∼450,000 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Overall, our combined GWAS meta-analysis reaches N∼700,000 individuals and substantially increases the number of GWAS signals associated with these traits.

However, this technique requires rigid head-fixation, constraining the behavioral repertoire of experimental subjects. Increasingly, complex task paradigms are being used to investigate the neural substrates of complex behaviors, including navigation of complex environments, resolving uncertainty between multiple outcomes, integrating unreliable information over time, andor building internal models of the world. In rodents, planning and decision making processes are often expressed via head and body motion. This produces a significant limitation for head-fixed two-photon imaging. We therefore developed a system that overcomes a major problem of head-fixation the lack of rotational vestibular input. The system measures rotational strain exerted by mice on the head restraint, which consequently drives a motor, rotating the constraint system and dissipating the strain. This permits mice to rotate their heads in the azimuthal plane with negligible inertia and friction. This stable rotating head-fixation system allows mice to explore physical or virtual 2-D environments. To demonstrate the performance of our system, we conducted 2-photon GCaMP6f imaging in somas and dendrites of pyramidal neurons in mouse retrosplenial cortex. We show that the subcellular resolution of the system’s 2-photon imaging is comparable to that of conventional head-fixed experiments. Additionally, this system allows the attachment of heavy instrumentation to the animal, making it possible to extend the approach to large-scale electrophysiology experiments in the future. Our method enables the use of state-of-the-art imaging techniques while animals perform more complex and naturalistic behaviors than currently possible, with broad potential applications in systems neuroscience.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"An animal-actuated rotational head-fixation system for 2-photon imaging during 2-d navigation, bioRxiv, 2018-03-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/an_animal-actuated_rotational_head-fixation_system_for_2-photon_imaging_during_2-d_navigation_33829308/"},{"date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTControlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years.

A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis. By reducing Hsp70 sequences targeted by piRNAs, we created UASz, which functions better than UASp in the germline and like UASt in somatic cells.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Efficient expression of genes in the Drosophila germline using a UAS-promoter free of interference by Hsp70 piRNAs, bioRxiv, 2018-03-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/efficient_expression_of_genes_in_the_drosophila_germline_using_a_uas-promoter_free_of_interference_by_hsp70_pirnas_33866774/"},{"date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMotivationQuality control and preprocessing of FASTQ files are essential to providing clean data for downstream analysis.

Existing methods for computational prediction of regulatory elements primarily predict binding in genomic regions with sequence similarity to known transcription factor sequence preferences. This has limited efficacy since most binding sites do not resemble known transcription factor sequence motifs, and many transcription factors are not even sequence-specific.ResultsWe developed Virtual ChIP-seq, which predicts binding of individual transcription factors in new cell types using an artificial neural network that integrates ChIP-seq results from other cell types and chromatin accessibility data in the new cell type. Virtual ChIP-seq also uses learned associations between gene expression and transcription factor binding at specific genomic regions.

Instead, a pre-trained DNN has served as a proxy for hierarchical visual representations, and fMRI data were used to decode individual DNN features of a stimulus image using a simple linear model, which were then passed to a reconstruction module. Here, we present our attempt to directly train a DNN model with fMRI data and the corresponding stimulus images to build an end-to-end reconstruction model. We trained a generative adversarial network with an additional loss term defined in a high-level feature space (feature loss) using up to 6,000 training data points (natural images and the fMRI responses). The trained deep generator network was tested on an independent dataset, directly producing a reconstructed image given an fMRI pattern as the input. The reconstructions obtained from the proposed method showed resemblance with both natural and artificial test stimuli. The accuracy increased as a function of the training data size, though not outperforming the decoded feature-based method with the available data size. Ablation analyses indicated that the feature loss played a critical role to achieve accurate reconstruction.

A large body of work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated that motor cortex provides flexible, time-varying activity patterns that control the arm during reaching and grasping. Previous studies have suggested that these patterns are generated by strong local recurrent dynamics operating autonomously from inputs during movement execution. An alternative possibility is that motor cortex requires coordination with upstream brain regions throughout the entire movement in order to yield these patterns. Here, we developed an experimental preparation in the mouse to directly test these possibilities using optogenetics and electrophysiology during a skilled reach-to-grab-to-eat task. To validate this preparation, we first established that a specific, time-varying pattern of motor cortical activity was required to produce coordinated movement. Next, in order to disentangle the contribution of local recurrent motor cortical dynamics from external input, we optogenetically held the recurrent contribution constant, then observed how motor cortical activity recovered following the end of this perturbation. Both the neural responses and hand trajectory varied from trial to trial, and this variability reflected variability in external inputs. To directly probe the role of these inputs, we used optogenetics to perturb activity in the thalamus. Thalamic perturbation at the start of the trial prevented movement initiation, and perturbation at any stage of the movement prevented progression of the hand to the target; this demonstrates that input is required throughout the movement. By comparing motor cortical activity with and without thalamic perturbation, we were able to estimate the effects of external inputs on motor cortical population activity. Thus, unlike pattern-generating circuits that are local and autonomous, such as those in the spinal cord that generate left-right alternation during locomotion, the pattern generator for reaching and grasping is distributed across multiple, strongly-interacting brain regions.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Motor cortex is an input-driven dynamical system controlling dexterous movement, bioRxiv, 2018-02-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/motor_cortex_is_an_input-driven_dynamical_system_controlling_dexterous_movement_33259776/"},{"date":"2018-02-15T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPredicting protein structure from sequence is a central challenge of biochemistry.

The number of these standardization efforts, driven by large organizations or at the grass root level, has been on the rise since the early 2000s. Thousands of community-developed standards are available (across all disciplines), many of which have been created andor implemented by several thousand data repositories. Nevertheless, their uptake by the research community, however, has been slow and uneven. This is mainly because investigators lack incentives to follow and adopt standards. The situation is exacerbated if standards are not promptly implemented by databases, repositories and other research tools, or endorsed by infrastructures. Furthermore, the fragmentation of community efforts results in the development of arbitrarily different, incompatible standards. In turn, this leads to standards becoming rapidly obsolete in fast-evolving research areas.As with any other digital object, standards, databases and repositories are dynamic in nature, with a ‘life cycle’ that encompasses formulation, development and maintenance; their status in this cycle may vary depending on the level of activity of the developing group or community. There is an urgent need for a service that enhances the information available on the evolving constellation of heterogeneous standards, databases and repositories, guides users in the selection of these resources, and that works with developers and maintainers of these resources to foster collaboration and promote harmonization.

The key reason the de Bruijn graph emerged as a popular short read assembly approach is because it offered an elegant representation of all repeats in a genome that reveals their mosaic structure. However, most algorithms for assembling long error-prone reads use an alternative overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) approach that does not provide a repeat characterization. We present the Flye algorithm for constructing the A-Bruijn (assembly) graph from long error-prone reads, that, in contrast to the k-mer-based de Bruijn graph, assembles genomes using an alignment-based A-Bruijn graph. In difference from existing assemblers, Flye does not attempt to construct accurate contigs (at least at the initial assembly stage) but instead simply generates arbitrary paths in the (unknown) assembly graph and further constructs an assembly graph from these paths. Counter-intuitively, this fast but seemingly reckless approach results in the same graph as the assembly graph constructed from accurate contigs. Flye constructs (overlapping) contigs with possible assembly errors at the initial stage, combines them into an accurate assembly graph, resolves repeats in the assembly graph using small variations between various repeat instances that were left unresolved during the initial assembly stage, constructs a new, less tangled assembly graph based on resolved repeats, and finally outputs accurate contigs as paths in this graph.

Recent applications of metabolic models have also demonstrated their usefulness in unraveling cross-feeding within microbial communities. Yet, the application of genome-scale models, especially to microbial communities, is lagging far behind the availability of sequenced genomes. This is largely due to the time-consuming steps of manual cura-tion required to obtain good quality models and thus physiologically meaningful simulation results. Here, we present an automated tool – CarveMe – for reconstruction of species and community level metabolic models. We introduce the concept of a universal model, which is manually curated and simulation-ready. Starting with this universal model and annotated genome sequences, CarveMe uses a top-down approach to build single-species and community models in a fast and scalable manner. We build reconstructions for two model organisms, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtillis, as well as a collection of human gut bacteria, and show that CarveMe models perform similarly to manually curated models in reproducing experimental phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of CarveMe through reconstructing 5587 bacterial models.

On average, the DNA density along the chromosome shows dense right and left arms that branch from a lower-density origin of replication, and are connected at the terminus of replication by an ultrathin flexible string of DNA. At the single-cell level, the DNA density along the torus is found to be strikingly heterogeneous, with blob-like Mbp-size domains that undergo major dynamic rearrangements, splitting and merging at a minute timescale. We show that prominent domain boundaries at the terminus and origin of replication are induced by MatP proteins, while weaker transient domain boundaries are facilitated by the global transcription regulators HU and Fis.

Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide limited taxonomic resolution, such as with the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as NanoSIMS imaging of single cells.Here we present “direct Protein-SIF” and the Calis-p software package (\u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p\u003ehttpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p\u003cjatsext-link\u003e), which enable high-throughput measurements of accurate δ13C values for individual species within a microbial community. We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Using mock community samples, we show that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community. Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteria-animal symbiosis showed that direct Protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected new insights into the symbionts’ metabolism.

In conventional nuclei, euchromatin is localized in the nuclear interior and heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery. In contrast, rod photoreceptors in nocturnal mammals have inverted nuclei, with a dense heterochromatic core and a thin euchromatic outer shell. This inverted architecture likely converts rod nuclei into microlenses to facilitate nocturnal vision, and may relate to the absence of particular proteins that tether heterochromatin to the lamina. However, both the mechanism of inversion and the role of interactions between different types of chromatin and the lamina in nuclear organization remain unknown. To elucidate this mechanism we performed Hi-C and microscopy on cells with inverted nuclei and their conventional counterparts. Strikingly, despite the inversion evident in microscopy, both types of nuclei display similar Hi-C maps. To resolve this paradox we developed a polymer model of chromosomes and found a universal mechanism that reconciles Hi-C and microscopy for both inverted and conventional nuclei. Based solely on attraction between heterochromatic regions, this mechanism is sufficient to drive phase separation of euchromatin and heterochromatin and faithfully reproduces the 3D organization of inverted nuclei. When interactions between heterochromatin and the lamina are added, the same model recreates the conventional nuclear organization. To further test our models, we eliminated lamina interactions in models of conventional nuclei and found that this triggers a spontaneous process of inversion that qualitatively reproduces the pathway of morphological changes during nuclear inversion in vivo. Together, our experiments and modeling suggest that interactions among heterochromatic regions are central to phase separation of the active and inactive genome in inverted and conventional nuclei, while interactions with the lamina are essential for building the conventional architecture from these segregated phases. Ultimately our data suggest that an inverted organization constitutes the default state of nuclear architecture.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Heterochromatin drives organization of conventional and inverted nuclei, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/heterochromatin_drives_organization_of_conventional_and_inverted_nuclei_31471754/"},{"date":"2018-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe origin of insect wings has long been debated. Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the leg’s epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.One Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Insect wings and body wall evolved from ancient leg segments, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/insect_wings_and_body_wall_evolved_from_ancient_leg_segments_31454380/"},{"date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Cannabis use is a heritable trait [1] that has been associated with adverse mental health outcomes.

By directly participating in the process of speciation, the genealogies of isolating loci have been thought to more faithfully represent species trees. The unique properties of speciation genes may provide valuable evolutionary insights and help determine the true history of species divergence. Here, we formally analyze whether genealogies from loci participating in Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) incompatibilities are more likely to be concordant with the species tree under incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Individual loci differ stochastically from the true history of divergence with a predictable frequency due to ILS, and these expectations—combined with the DM model of intrinsic reproductive isolation from epistatic interactions—can be used to examine the probability of concordance at isolating loci. Contrary to existing verbal models, we find that reproductively isolating loci that follow the DM model are often more likely to have discordant gene trees. These results are dependent on the pattern of isolation observed between three species, the time between speciation events, and the time since the last speciation event. Results supporting a higher probability of discordance are found for both derived-derived and derived-ancestral DM pairs, and regardless of whether incompatibilities are allowed or prohibited from segregating in the same population.

Until now dating analyses using the MSC have been based on a fixed clock or informally derived node priors instead of the FBD. On the other hand, dating analyses using an FBD process have concatenated all gene sequences and ignored coalescence processes. To address these mirror-image deficiencies in evolutionary models, we have developed an integrative model of evolution which combines both the FBD and MSC models. By applying concatenation and the MSC (without employing the FBD process) to an exemplar data set consisting of molecular sequence data and morphological characters from the dog and fox subfamily Caninae, we show that concatenation causes predictable biases in estimated branch lengths. We then applied concatenation using the FBD process and the combined FBD-MSC model to show that the same biases are still observed when the FBD process is employed. These biases can be avoided by using the FBD-MSC model, which coherently models fossilization and gene evolution, and does not require an a priori substitution rate estimate to calibrate the molecular clock.

Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses.

Many efforts are currently underway to use the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the therapeutic correction of human genetic diseases. The most widely used homologs of the Cas9 protein are derived from the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Based on the fact that these two bacterial species cause infections in the human population at high frequencies, we looked for the presence of pre-existing adaptive immune responses to their respective Cas9 homologs, SaCas9 (S. aureus homolog of Cas9) and SpCas9 (S. pyogenes homolog of Cas9). To determine the presence of anti-Cas9 antibodies, we probed for the two homologs using human serum and were able to detect antibodies against both, with 79% of donors staining against SaCas9 and 65% of donors staining against SpCas9. Upon investigating the presence of antigen-specific T-cells against the two homologs in human peripheral blood, we found anti-SaCas9 T-cells in 46% of donors. Upon isolating, expanding, and conducting antigen re-stimulation experiments on several of these donors’ anti-SaCas9 T-cells, we observed an SaCas9-specific response confirming that these T-cells were antigen-specific. We were unable to detect antigen-specific T-cells against SpCas9, although the sensitivity of the assay precludes us from concluding that such T-cells do not exist. Together, this data demonstrates that there are pre-existing humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses to Cas9 in humans, a factor which must be taken into account as the CRISPR-Cas9 system moves forward into clinical trials.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","500+-users","2018"],"title":"Identification of Pre-Existing Adaptive Immunity to Cas9 Proteins in Humans, bioRxiv, 2018-01-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/identification_of_pre-existing_adaptive_immunity_to_cas9_proteins_in_humans_31294982/"},{"date":"2018-01-06T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBirds and other vertebrates display stunning variation in pigmentation patterning, yet the genes controlling this diversity remain largely unknown.

Allele-specific expression differences in NDP indicate cis-regulatory differences between ancestral and melanistic alleles. Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), providing a striking example of introgression of alleles that are favored by breeders and are potentially advantageous in the wild. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like two human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in NDP.

Here, we introduce an approach to modulating neural circuits noninvasively with spatial, cell-type and temporal specificity. This approach, called acoustically targeted chemogenetics, or ATAC, uses transient ultrasonic opening of the blood brain barrier to transduce neurons at specific locations in the brain with virally-encoded engineered G-protein-coupled receptors, which subsequently respond to systemically administered bio-inert compounds to activate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. We demonstrate this concept in mice by using ATAC to noninvasively modify and subsequently activate or inhibit excitatory neurons within the hippocampus, showing that this enables pharmacological control of memory formation. This technology allows a brief, noninvasive procedure to make one or more specific brain regions capable of being selectively modulated using orally bioavailable compounds, thereby overcoming some of the key limitations of conventional brain therapies.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics for Noninvasive Control of Neural Circuits, bioRxiv, 2018-01-02","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/acoustically_targeted_chemogenetics_for_noninvasive_control_of_neural_circuits_31144328/"},{"date":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTN-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) Deficiency is a rare monogenic multi-system disorder first described in 2014.

Using a deep convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypic markers when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling and dropout strategies to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional marker data. We used a large GS dataset to train DeepGS and compare its performance with other methods. In terms of mean normalized discounted cumulative gain value, DeepGS achieves an increase of 27.70%~246.34% over a conventional neural network in selecting top-ranked 1% individuals with high phenotypic values for the eight tested traits. Additionally, compared with the widely used method RR-BLUP, DeepGS still yields a relative improvement ranging from 1.44% to 65.24%.

This connection has flourished during the past two decades (3–7), giving rise to important insights into the ecology and evolution of cancer progression, with therapeutic implications (8–10). Here, we take a metapopulation view of metastasis (i.e. the migration to and colonization of, habitat patches) and represent it as a bipartite network, distinguishing source patches, or organs that host a primary tumor, and acceptor patches, or organs colonized ultimately from the source through metastasis. Using 20,326, biomedical records obtained from literature, we show that (i) the network structure of cancer ecosystems is non-random, exhibiting a nested subset pattern as has been found both in the distribution of species across islands and island-like habitats (11–13), and in the distribution of among species interactions across different ecological networks (14–16); (ii) similar to ecological networks, there is a heterogeneous distribution of degree (i.e., number of connections associated with a source or acceptor organ); (iii) there is a significant correlation between metastatic incidence (or the frequency with which tumor cells from a source organ colonize an acceptor one) and arterial blood supply, suggesting that more irrigated organs have a higher probability of developing metastasis or being invaded; (iv) there is a positive correlation between metastatic incidence and acceptor organ degree (or number of different tumor-bearing source organs that generate metastasis in a given acceptor organ), and a negative one between acceptor organ degree and number of stem cell divisions, implying that there are preferred sink organs for metastasis and that this could be related to average acceptor organ cell longevity; (v) there is a negative association between organ cell turnover and source organ degree, implying that organs with rapid cell turnovers tend to generate more metastasis, a process akin to the phenomenon of propagule pressure in ecology (17); and (vi) the cancer ecosystem network exhibits a modular structure in both source and acceptor patches, suggesting that some of them share more connections among themselves than with the rest of the network. We show that both niche-related processes occurring at the organ level as well as spatial connectivity and propagule pressure contribute to metastaticspread and result in a non-random cancer network, which exhibits a truncated power law degree distribution, clustering and a nested subset structure.

Here, we argue that humans use uncertainty inherent in their representations of value beliefs to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation. Such uncertainty is reflected in explicit confidence judgments. Using a novel variant of a multi-armed bandit paradigm, we studied how beliefs were formed and how uncertainty in the encoding of these value beliefs (belief confidence) evolved over time. We found that people used uncertainty to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation, reflected in a higher tendency towards exploration when their confidence in their value representations was low. We furthermore found that value uncertainty can be linked to frameworks of metacognition in decision making in two ways. First, belief confidence drives decision confidence—that is people’s evaluation of their own choices. Second, individuals with higher metacognitive insight into their choices were also better at tracing the uncertainty in their environment.

Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed reconstructs or generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images.

Many TFs preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions at its solvent-exposed side. TFs often also bind nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation, because the nucleosome breaks the local rotational symmetry of DNA. Some TFs also specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position where only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other TFs prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them.

Here, noting that these models diverge with increased number of drugs, we contrast their predictions with measurements of Escherichia coli growth under combinations of up to 10 different antibiotics. As the number of drugs increases, Bliss maintains accuracy while Loewe systematically loses its predictive power. The total dosage required for growth inhibition, which Loewe predicts should be fixed, steadily increases with the number of drugs, following a square root scaling. This scaling is explained by an approximation to Bliss where, inspired by RA Fisher’s classical geometric model 12, dosages of independent drugs adds up as orthogonal vectors rather than linearly. This dose-orthogonality approximation provides results similar to Bliss, yet uses the dosage language as Loewe and is hence easier to implement and intuit. The rejection of dosage additivity in favor of effect additivity and dosage orthogonality provides a framework for understanding how multiple drugs and stressors add up in nature and the clinic.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"The null additivity of multi-drug combinations, bioRxiv, 2017-12-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_null_additivity_of_multi-drug_combinations_30901769/"},{"date":"2017-12-25T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTCanalization of developmental processes ensures the reproducibility and robustness of embryogenesis within each species.

This quantitative approach revealed that individual cell geometries and cell contacts are strongly constrained, and that these constraints are tightly linked to the control of fate specification by local cell inductions. While in vertebrates ligand concentration usually controls cell inductions, we found that this role is fulfilled in ascidians by the area of contacts between signaling and responding cells.

Dissociable brain circuits and cell-types are thought to preferentially participate in distinct learning mechanisms. For example, the activity of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons is proposed to primarily, or even exclusively, reflect reward prediction error signals in well-trained animals. To study the specific contribution of individual circuits requires observing changes before tight functional coordination is achieved. However, little is known about the detailed timing of the emergence of reward-related representations in dopaminergic neurons. Here we recorded activity of identified dopaminergic neurons as naïve mice learned a novel stimulus-reward association. We found that at early stages of learning mDA neuron activity reflected both external (sensory) and internal (action initiation) causes of reward expectation. The increasingly precise correlation of action initiation with sensory stimuli rather than an evaluation of outcomes governed mDA neuron activity. Thus, our data demonstrate that mDA neuron activity early in learning does not reflect errors, but is more akin to a Hebbian learning signal - providing new insight into a critical computation in a highly conserved, essential learning circuit.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Emergence of reward expectation signals in identified dopamine neurons, bioRxiv, 2017-12-23","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/emergence_of_reward_expectation_signals_in_identified_dopamine_neurons_30829742/"},{"date":"2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryThe diversity of cell types and regulatory states in the brain, and how these change during ageing, remains largely unknown.

It is commonly used to identify essential genes. Single gene deletion libraries are considered the gold standard for identifying essential genes. Currently, the TraDIS method has not been benchmarked against such libraries and therefore it remains unclear whether the two methodologies are comparable. To address this, a high density transposon library was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12. Essential genes predicted from sequencing of this library were compared to existing essential gene databases. To decrease false positive identification of essential gene candidates, statistical data analysis included corrections for both gene length and genome length. Through this analysis new essential genes and genes previously incorrectly designated as essential were identified. We show that manual analysis of TraDIS data reveals novel features that would not have been detected by statistical analysis alone. Examples include short essential regions within genes, orientation-dependent effects and fine resolution identification of genome and protein features. Recognition of these insertion profiles in transposon mutagenesis datasets will assist genome annotation of less well characterized genomes and provides new insights into bacterial physiology and biochemistry.IMPORTANCEIncentives to define lists of genes that are essential for bacterial survival include the identification of potential targets for antibacterial drug development, genes required for rapid growth for exploitation in biotechnology, and discovery of new biochemical pathways.

Initial automated analysis of the resulting data revealed many discrepancies when compared to the literature. We now report more extensive statistical analysis supported by both literature searches and detailed inspection of high density TraDIS sequencing data for each putative essential gene for the model laboratory organism, Escherichia coli.

FMREs were enriched in super-enhancers, H3K27ac enhancer marks of primary tumors and long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that the mutations drive cancer by distally controlling gene expression through threedimensional genome organization. In support of this hypothesis, the chromatin interaction network of FMREs and target genes revealed associations of mutations and differential gene expression of known and novel cancer genes (e.g., CNNB1IP1, RCC1), activation of immune response pathways and altered enhancer marks.

While scalability of methods to datasets of these sizes is a challenge on its own, dealing with large-scale experimental design presents a whole new set of problems, including batch effects and sample comparison issues. Currently, there are no computational tools that can both handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner (many cells) and at the same time deal with many samples (many patients or conditions).

Indeed, the brain’s visual and navigational systems are known to interact5, 6, and signals related to position in the environment have been suggested to appear as early as in visual cortex6, 7. To establish the nature of these signals we recorded in primary visual cortex (V1) and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice traversed a corridor in virtual reality. The corridor contained identical visual landmarks in two positions, so that a purely visual neuron would respond similarly in those positions. Most V1 neurons, however, responded solely or more strongly to the landmarks in one position. This modulation of visual responses by spatial location was not explained by factors such as running speed. To assess whether the modulation is related to navigational signals and to the animal’s subjective estimate of position, we trained the mice to lick for a water reward upon reaching a reward zone in the corridor. Neuronal populations in both CA1 and V1 encoded the animal’s position along the corridor, and the errors in their representations were correlated. Moreover, both representations reflected the animal’s subjective estimate of position, inferred from the animal’s licks, better than its actual position. Indeed, when animals licked in a given location – whether correct or incorrect – neural populations in both V1 and CA1 placed the animal in the reward zone. We conclude that visual responses in V1 are tightly controlled by navigational signals, which are coherent with those encoded in hippocampus, and reflect the animal’s subjective position in the environment. The presence of such navigational signals as early as in a primary sensory area suggests that these signals permeate sensory processing in the cortex.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Coherent representations of subjective spatial position in primary visual cortex and hippocampus, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/coherent_representations_of_subjective_spatial_position_in_primary_visual_cortex_and_hippocampus_30614236/"},{"date":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","description":"This report describes an error in the Framingham Risk Score data presented in the original SPRINT publication.1 The data, presented in Table 1 of the main SPRINT publication in the New England Journal of Medicine and made available to SPRINT Challenge participants, incorrectly calculated the level of baseline cardiovascular risk of the study participants using the Framingham Risk Score.

Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur co-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing, due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products (mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here, we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent, multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Most multi-intron transcripts were fully spliced, consistent with rapid co-transcriptional splicing. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts were either fully spliced or fully unspliced, suggesting that splicing of any given intron is dependent on the splicing status of other introns in the transcript. Supporting this, mild inhibition of splicing by a temperature-sensitive mutation in Prp2, the homolog of vertebrate U2AF65, increased the frequency of fully unspliced transcripts. Importantly, fully unspliced transcripts displayed transcriptional read-through at the polyA site and were degraded co-transcriptionally by the nuclear exosome. Finally, we show that cellular mRNA levels were reduced in genes with a high number of unspliced nascent transcripts during caffeine treatment, showing regulatory significance of co-transcriptional splicing. Therefore, overall splicing of individual nascent transcripts, 3’ end formation, and mRNA half-life depend on the splicing status of neighboring introns, suggesting crosstalk among spliceosomes and the polyA cleavage machinery during transcription elongation.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Long-read sequencing of nascent RNA reveals coupling among RNA processing events, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/long-read_sequencing_of_nascent_rna_reveals_coupling_among_rna_processing_events_30642254/"},{"date":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe sarcomere is the basic contractile unit within cardiomyocytes driving heart muscle contraction.

The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of “nitrogen fixing trees” into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.The phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.Generalizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts.

Its unique structure of interspersed conserved and variable regions is an excellent target for PCR and allows for classification of reads at all taxonomic levels. However, the relatively few phylogenetically informative sites prevent confident phylogenetic placements of novel lineages that are deep branching relative to reference taxa. This problem is exacerbated when only short 16S rRNA gene fragments are sequenced. To resolve their placement, it is common practice to gather more informative sites by combining multiple conserved genes into concatenated datasets. This however requires genomic data which may be obtained through relatively expensive metagenome sequencing and computationally demanding analyses. Here we develop a protocol that amplifies a large part of 16S and 23S rRNA genes within the rRNA operon, including the ITS region, and sequences the amplicons with PacBio long-read technology. We tested our method with a synthetic mock community and developed a read curation pipeline that reduces the overall error rate to 0.18%. Applying our method on four diverse environmental samples, we were able to capture near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes.

In addition, a southern coastal route has been relentlessly imposed to explain the Eurasian colonization of these African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, from which all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, that out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya. On the opposite side, we have proposed a northern route through Central Asia across the Levant for that expansion. Consistent with the fossil record, we have dated it around 125 kya. To help bridge differences between the molecular and fossil record ages, in this article we assess the possibility that mtDNA macrohaplogroup L3 matured in Eurasia and returned to Africa as basic L3 lineages around 70 kya.ResultsThe coalescence ages of all Eurasian (M,N) and African L3 lineages, both around 71 kya, are not significantly different. The oldest M and N Eurasian clades are found in southeastern Asia instead near of Africa as expected by the southern route hypothesis. The split of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very similar to the age of mtDNA L3. A Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa has been proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E. Inside Africa, frequency distributions of maternal L3 and paternal E lineages are positively correlated. This correlation is not fully explained by geographic or ethnic affinities.

Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signal’s functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions. Thirdly, knowing the functional dimensionality allows assessing task-related differences in the complexity of neural patterns.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Estimating the functional dimensionality of neural representations, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/estimating_the_functional_dimensionality_of_neural_representations_30401620/"},{"date":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","description":"Summarizing spatial patterns in human genetic diversity to understand population history has been a persistent goal for human geneticists. Here, we use a recently developed spatially explicit method to estimate effective migration surfaces to visualize how human genetic diversity is geographically structured (the EEMS method).  The resulting surfaces are rugged, which indicates the relationship between genetic and geographic distance is heterogenous and distorted as a rule.  Most prominently, topographic and marine features regularly align with increased genetic differentiation (e.g. the Sahara desert, Mediterranean Sea or Himalaya at large scales; the Adriatic, inter-island straits in near Oceania at smaller scales).  We also see traces of historical migrations and boundaries of language families.  These results provide visualizations of human genetic diversity that reveal local patterns of differentiation in detail and emphasize that while genetic similarity generally decays with geographic distance, there have regularly been factors that subtly distort the underlying relationship across space observed today.

The expected SFS has a strong dependence on the historical population demography and this property is exploited by popular statistical methods to infer complex demographic histories from DNA sequence data. Most, if not all, of these inference methods exhibit pathological behavior, however. Specifically, they often display runaway behavior in optimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations can degenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of the inferred demography to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is to provide theoretical insights into why such problems arise. To this end, we characterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementioned pathological behavior of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometry of the expected SFS. We provide explicit descriptions and visualizations for a toy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition to arbitrary sample sizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop a universal characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sample of size n under an arbitrary population history can be recapitulated by a piecewise-constant demography with only κn epochs, where κn is between n2 and 2n – 1. The set of expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographies with fewer than κn epochs is open and non-convex, which causes the above phenomena for inference from data.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Geometry of the sample frequency spectrum and the perils of demographic inference, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/geometry_of_the_sample_frequency_spectrum_and_the_perils_of_demographic_inference_30420293/"},{"date":"2017-12-14T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractRecent advances in bioinformatics have enabled the rapid assembly of genomes from metagenomes (MAGs), and there is a need for reproducible pipelines that can annotate and characterise thousands of genomes simultaneously.

The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to ∼10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 μM and 600 μM, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitationdepression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.Significance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Ultrafast glutamate sensors resolve high-frequency release at Schaffer collateral synapses, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/ultrafast_glutamate_sensors_resolve_high-frequency_release_at_schaffer_collateral_synapses_30393707/"},{"date":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIn Drosophila melanogaster, the germband forms directly on the egg surface and solely consists of embryonic tissue. In contrast, most insect embryos undergo a complicated set of tissue rearrangements to generate a condensed, multi-layered germband. The ventral side of the germband is embryonic, while the dorsal side is thought to be an extraembryonic tissue called the amnion. While this tissue organisation has been accepted for decades, and has been widely reported in insects, its accuracy has not been directly tested in any species. Using live cell tracking and differential cell labelling in the short germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, I show that most of the cells previously thought to be amnion actually give rise to large parts of the embryo. This process occurs via the dorsal-to-ventral flow of cells and contributes to germband extension. In addition, I show that true ‘amnion’ cells in Tribolium originate from a small region of the blastoderm. Together, my findings show that development in the short germ embryos of Tribolium and the long germ embryos of Drosophila is more similar than previously proposed. Dorsal-to-ventral cell flow also occurs in Drosophila during germband extension, and I argue that the flow is driven by a conserved set of underlying morphogenetic events in both species. Furthermore, the revised Tribolium fatemap that I present is far more similar to that of Drosophila than the classic Tribolium fatemap. Lastly, my findings show that there is no qualitative difference between the tissue structure of the cellularised blastoderm and the shortintermediate germ germband. As such, the same tissue patterning mechanisms could function continuously throughout the cellularised blastoderm and germband stages, and easily shift between them over evolutionary time.Author summaryIn many animals, certain groups of cells in the embryo do not directly contribute to adult structures. Instead, these cells generate so-called ‘extra-embryonic tissues’ that support and facilitate development, but degenerate prior to birthhatching. In most insect species, embryos are described as having two major extra-embryonic tissues; the serosa, which encapsulates the entire embryo and yolk, and the amnion, which covers one side of the embryo. This tissue structure has been widely reported for over a century, but detailed studies on the amnion are lacking. Working in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, I used long-term fluorescent live imaging, cell tracking and differential cell labelling to investigate amnion development. In contrast to our current understanding, I show that most cells previously thought to be amnion actually form large parts of the embryo. In addition, I show how these cells ‘flow’ as a whole tissue and contribute to elongation of the embryo, and how only a relatively small number of cells form the actual amnion. Lastly, I describe how my findings show that despite exhibiting substantial differences in overall structure, embryos of Tribolium and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, utilise a conserved set of morphogenetic processes.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"A revised understanding of Tribolium morphogenesis further reconciles short and long germ development, bioRxiv, 2017-12-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_revised_understanding_of_tribolium_morphogenesis_further_reconciles_short_and_long_germ_development_30343453/"},{"date":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBackgroundPrevious research shows that men often receive more research funding than women, but does not provide empirical evidence as to why this occurs.

Here we have harnessed the haplotype-based method fineSTRUCTURE in an Irish genome-wide SNP dataset, identifying 23 discrete genetic clusters which segregate with geographical provenance. Cluster diversity is pronounced in the west of Ireland but reduced in the east where older structure has been eroded by historical migrations. Accordingly, when populations from the neighbouring island of Britain are included, a west-east cline of Celtic-British ancestry is revealed along with a particularly striking correlation between haplotypes and geography across both islands. A strong relationship is revealed between subsets of Northern Irish and Scottish populations, where discordant genetic and geographic affinities reflect major migrations in recent centuries. Additionally, Irish genetic proximity of all Scottish samples likely reflects older strata of communication across the narrowest inter-island crossing. Using GLOBETROTTER we detected Irish admixture signals from Britain and Europe and estimated dates for events consistent with the historical migrations of the Norse-Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and the British Plantations. The influence of the former is greater than previously estimated from Y chromosome haplotypes. In all, we paint a new picture of the genetic landscape of Ireland, revealing structure which should be considered in the design of studies examining rare genetic variation and its association with traits.Author summaryA recent genetic study of the UK (People of the British Isles; PoBI) expanded our understanding of population history of the islands, using newly-developed, powerful techniques that harness the rich information embedded in chunks of genetic code called haplotypes. These methods revealed subtle regional diversity across the UK, and, using genetic data alone, timed key migration events into southeast England and Orkney. We have extended these methods to Ireland, identifying regional differences in genetics across the island that adhere to geography at a resolution not previously reported. Our study reveals relative western diversity and eastern homogeneity in Ireland owing to a history of settlement concentrated on the east coast and longstanding Celtic diversity in the west. We show that Irish Celtic diversity enriches the findings of PoBI; haplotypes mirror geography across Britain and Ireland, with relic Celtic populations contributing greatly to haplotypic diversity. Finally, we used genetic information to date migrations into Ireland from Europe and Britain consistent with historical records of Viking and Norman invasions, demonstrating the signatures of these migrations the on modern Irish genome. Our findings demonstrate that genetic structure exists in even small isolated populations, which has important implications for population-based genetic association studies.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/insular_celtic_population_structure_and_genomic_footprints_of_migration_30168232/"},{"date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Cellular elongation requires the defined coordination of intra- and extracellular processes.

It remains, however, completely unknown how the vacuolar size is coordinated with other growth-relevant processes. Intriguingly, we show that extracellular constraints impact on the intracellular expansion of the vacuole. The underlying cell wall sensing mechanism requires the interaction of the extracellular leucine-rich repeat extensin (LRX) with the receptor-like kinase Feronia (FER). Our data suggests that LRX links the plasma membrane localised FER with the cell wall, allowing this module to jointly sense and convey extracellular signals to the underlying cell. This mechanism coordinates cell wall acidificationloosening with the increase in vacuolar size, contributing cytosol homeostasis during plant cell expansion.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"LRX- and FER-dependent extracellular sensing coordinates vacuolar size for cytosol homeostasis, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/lrx-_and_fer-dependent_extracellular_sensing_coordinates_vacuolar_size_for_cytosol_homeostasis_30164181/"},{"date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSingle-molecule full-length cDNA sequencing can aid genome annotation by revealing transcript structure and alternative splice-forms, yet current annotation pipelines do not incorporate such information.

To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short read whole genome sequencing. However, standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the advantages of short reads. Starting from only ∼1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as ‘Linked-Reads’. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. 2017). In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short read approaches for reference based analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications.

High-speed imaging and optogenetic lineage tracing corroborated that the zebrafish ventricle forms through continuous addition from the undifferentiated progenitor sheath followed by late-phase accrual of the bulbus arteriosus (BA).

However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods.

In statistical terms, this means that traits measured on one species will not be independent of traits measured on others. Since their introduction in the 1980s, phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs) have been framed as a solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against --- unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term phylogenetic natural history) to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses. We suggest that one way to refine our inferences is to re-imagine phylogenies as probabilistic graphical models; adopting this way of thinking will help clarify precisely what we are testing and what evidence supports our claims.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Rethinking phylogenetic comparative methods, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/rethinking_phylogenetic_comparative_methods_29230924/"},{"date":"2017-12-06T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTMany parasites with complex life cycles modify their intermediate host’s behaviour, which has been proposed to increase transmission to their definitive host.

To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing (1) “bag-of-words” which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built “bag-of-k-mers” and “vector-k-mers” models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an accuracy above 90%. Our “bag-of-k-mers” achieved higher overall accuracy, while the “vector-k-mers” models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions.

Previously, we described a role for actin in the regulation of flagella-building intraflagellar transport machinery. Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to this process using a nap1 mutant Chlamydomonas strain. Disruption of a single actin allows normal or slower incorporation but complete flagellar assembly. However, when we disrupt both actins using Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins is actin-dependent. Upon total actin disruption during flagellar assembly, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles, suggesting impaired vesicular trafficking may be the mechanism by which actin supports flagellar growth from new flagellar proteins. We also find there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Extended (2 hour) treatment with LatB, a condition under which NAP1 is upregulated, restores NPHP-4 localization. This suggests NAP1 can perform the functions of conventional actin at the transition zone. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Partially redundant actin genes in Chlamydomonas control flagellum-directed traffic and transition zone organization, bioRxiv, 2017-12-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/partially_redundant_actin_genes_in_chlamydomonas_control_flagellum-directed_traffic_and_transition_zone_organization_29742284/"},{"date":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","description":"Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration.

The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an (Δ𝜇, 𝑁, 𝑝, 𝑇) ensemble.

Answering this question requires robust measurement of whole-genome relatedness among thousands of genomes and from diverge phylogenetic lineages. Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) can provide the resolution needed for this task, overcoming several limitations of traditional techniques used for the same purposes. Although the number of genomes currently available may be adequate, the associated bioinformatics tools for analysis are lagging behind these developments and cannot scale to large datasets. Here, we present a new method, FastANI, to compute ANI using alignment-free approximate sequence mapping. Our analyses demonstrate that FastANI produces an accurate ANI estimate and is up to three orders of magnitude faster when compared to an alignment (e.g., BLAST)-based approach. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal a clear genetic discontinuity among the database genomes, with 99.8% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed showing either \u0026gt;95% intra-species ANI or \u0026lt;83% inter-species ANI values. We further show that this discontinuity is recovered with or without the most frequently represented species in the database and is robust to historic additions in the public genome databases.

Using nonlocal “replay” of spatial locations in hippocampus as a window into memory access, we simulate a spatial navigation task where an agent accesses memories of locations sequentially, ordered by utility how much extra reward would be earned due to the computation enabling better choices. This prioritization balances two desiderata the need to evaluate imminent choices, vs. the gain from propagating newly encountered information to predecessor states. We show that this theory offers a unifying account of a range of hitherto disconnected findings in the place cell literature such as the balance of forward and reverse replay, biases in the replayed content, and effects of experience. Accordingly, various types of nonlocal events during behavior and rest are re-interpreted as instances of a single choice evaluation operation, unifying seemingly disparate proposed functions of replay including planning, learning and consolidation, and whose dysfunction may underlie pathologies like rumination and craving.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay, bioRxiv, 2017-11-28","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/prioritized_memory_access_explains_planning_and_hippocampal_replay_29539364/"},{"date":"2017-11-26T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYModern genetic approaches are powerful in providing access to diverse types of neurons within the mammalian brain and greatly facilitating the study of their function.

We presented 107 females with pairs of images of male faces – one with a more masculine shape and one more feminine – and recorded their looking behaviour. Females looked at the masculine face longer than at the feminine face in more trials than predicted by chance.

Additionally, the proportion of time subjects looked toward the masculine face increased as the within-pair difference in masculinity increased.

We show that although resistance prevents drive systems from spreading to fixation in large populations, even the least effective systems reported to date are highly invasive. Releasing a small number of organisms often causes invasion of the local population, followed by invasion of additional populations connected by very low gene flow rates.

Tracking these events across a birth cohort during their first five years, we demonstrate that \u0026gt;80% of infectious events indeed involve viral pathogens, but are accompanied by a shift in the nasopharyngeal microbiome (NPM) towards dominance by a small range of pathogenic bacterial genera. Unexpectedly, this change in NPM frequently precedes the appearance of viral pathogens and acute symptoms. In non-sensitized children these events are associated only with “transient wheeze” that resolves after age three. In contrast, in children developing early allergic sensitization, they are associated with ensuing development of persistent wheeze, which is the hallmark of the asthma phenotype. This suggests underlying pathogenic interactions between allergic sensitization and antibacterial mechanisms.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Dynamics of the upper airway microbiome in the pathogenesis of asthma-associated persistent wheeze in preschool children, bioRxiv, 2017-11-21","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/dynamics_of_the_upper_airway_microbiome_in_the_pathogenesis_of_asthma-associated_persistent_wheeze_in_preschool_children_29174935/"},{"date":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe study of visual working memory (VWM) has recently seen revitalization with the emergence of new insights and theories regarding its neural underpinnings. One crucial ingredient responsible for this progress is the rise of neural decoding techniques. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. Here, we aimed to contribute to the field by subjecting human volunteers to a combined VWMimagery task, while recording and decoding their neural signals as measured by MEG. At first sight, the results seem to provide evidence for a persistent, stable representation of the memorandum throughout the delay period. However, control analyses revealed that these findings can be explained by subtle, VWM-specific eye movements. As a potential remedy, we demonstrate the use of a functional localizer, which was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements, to train the neural decoders. This analysis revealed a sustained representation for approximately 1 second, but no longer throughout the entire delay period. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.Significance statementVisual working memory is an important aspect of higher cognition and has been subject of much investigation within the field of cognitive neuroscience. Over recent years, these studies have increasingly relied on the use of neural decoding techniques. Here, we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by stimulus-specific eye movements. Such eye movements during working memory have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon. Given the widespread use of neural decoding and the potentially contaminating effects of eye movements, we therefore believe that our results are of significant relevance for the field.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Eye movement-related confounds in neural decoding of visual working memory representations, bioRxiv, 2017-11-21","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/eye_movement-related_confounds_in_neural_decoding_of_visual_working_memory_representations_29183431/"},{"date":"2017-11-21T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIdentification of individuals at increased genetic risk for a complex disorder such as coronary disease can facilitate treatments or enhanced screening strategies.

There are currently two distinct views of genome organization that are derived from different technologies. The first view, derived from genome-wide proximity ligation methods (e.g. Hi-C), suggests that genome organization is largely organized around chromosomes. The second view, derived from in situ imaging, suggests a central role for nuclear bodies. Yet, because microscopy and proximity-ligation methods measure different aspects of genome organization, these two views remain poorly reconciled and our overall understanding of how genomic DNA is organized within the nucleus remains incomplete. Here, we develop Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension (SPRITE), which moves away from proximity-ligation and enables genome-wide detection of higher-order DNA interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known genome structures identified by Hi-C and show that the contact frequencies measured by SPRITE strongly correlate with the 3-dimensional distances measured by microscopy. In addition to known structures, SPRITE identifies two major hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are spatially arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles, respectively. We find that the majority of genomic regions exhibit preferential spatial association relative to one of these nuclear bodies, with regions that are highly transcribed by RNA Polymerase II organizing around nuclear speckles and transcriptionally inactive and centromere-proximal regions organizing around the nucleolus. Together, our results reconcile the two distinct pictures of nuclear structure and demonstrate that nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall 3-dimensional packaging of genomic DNA in the nucleus.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Higher-order inter-chromosomal hubs shape 3-dimensional genome organization in the nucleus, bioRxiv, 2017-11-19","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/higher-order_inter-chromosomal_hubs_shape_3-dimensional_genome_organization_in_the_nucleus_29113092/"},{"date":"2017-11-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe alpha rhythm is the longest studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition.

We first found that alpha in posterior cortex propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas towards the occipital pole, consistent with alpha effecting top-down processing. This cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpharhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback which propagates from higher to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus.

Here we investigate the transcription initiation landscape and its associated RNA decay in D. melanogaster. Surprisingly, we find that the majority of active gene-distal enhancers and a considerable fraction of gene promoters are divergently transcribed. We observe quantitative relationships between enhancer potential, expression level and core promoter strength, providing an explanation for indirectly related histone modifications that are reflecting expression levels. Lowly abundant unstable RNAs initiated from weak core promoters are key characteristics of gene-distal developmental enhancers, while the housekeeping enhancer strengths of gene promoters reflect their expression strengths. The different layers of regulation mediated by gene-distal enhancers and gene promoters are also reflected in chromatin interaction data.

Despite their biological importance and medical relevance, MGEs from the gut microbiome have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal MGEs in the gut microbiome using a method called Split Read Insertion Detection (SRID) that enables the identification of the exact mobilizable unit of MGEs. Leveraging the SRID method, we curated a database of 5600 putative MGEs encompassing seven MGE classes called ImmeDB (Intestinal microbiome mobile element database) (\u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsimmedb.mit.edu\u003ehttpsimmedb.mit.edu\u003cjatsext-link\u003e).

We find that antibiotic resistance genes are more likely to be spread by conjugation via integrative conjugative elements or integrative mobilizable elements than transduction via prophages. Additionally, we observed that horizontal transfer of MGEs is extensive within phyla but rare across phyla.

We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 884 young healthy adults in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. We attempted to predict personality traits from the “Big Five”, as assessed with the NEO-FFI test, using individual functional connectivity matrices. After regressing out potential confounds (such as age, sex, handedness and fluid intelligence), we used a cross-validated framework, together with test-retest replication (across two sessions of resting-state fMRI for each subject), to quantify how well the neuroimaging data could predict each of the five personality factors. We tested three different (published) denoising strategies for the fMRI data, two inter-subject alignment and brain parcellation schemes, and three different linear models for prediction. As measurement noise is known to moderate statistical relationships, we performed final prediction analyses using average connectivity across both imaging sessions (1 h of data), with the analysis pipeline that yielded the highest predictability overall. Across all results (testretest; 3 denoising strategies; 2 alignment schemes; 3 models), Openness to experience emerged as the only reliably predicted personality factor. Using the full hour of resting-state data and the best pipeline, we could predict Openness to experience (NEOFAC_O r=0.24, R2=0.024) almost as well as we could predict the score on a 24-item intelligence test (PMAT24_A_CR r=0.26, R2=0.044).

We could account for 5% of the variance in the β superordinate factor (r=0.27, R2=0.050), which loads highly on Openness to experience.

Analysis of somatic structural variation exposed complex rearrangement patterns, involving cycles of templated insertions and tandem duplications, in BRCA1-deficient tumours. Genome-wide association analysis implicated common genetic variation at the APOBEC3 gene cluster with reduced basal levels of somatic mutagenesis attributable to APOBEC cytidine deaminases across cancer types.

While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in ∼30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over ∼6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts, bioRxiv, 2017-10-31","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/evolutionary_dynamics_of_bacteria_in_the_gut_microbiome_within_and_across_hosts_28127345/"},{"date":"2017-10-31T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPerceptions, thoughts and actions unfold over millisecond timescales, while learned behaviors can require many days to mature.

We identified over 5,000 host genes that change expression, including 588 distinct associations between specific taxa and host genes. The taxa with the strongest influence on gene expression alter the response of genes associated with complex traits.

We find that B. fragilis within-subject populations contain substantial de novo nucleotide and mobile element diversity, which preserve years of within-person evolutionary history. This evolutionary history contains signatures of within-person adaptation to both subject-specific and common selective forces, including parallel mutations in sixteen genes. These sixteen genes are involved in cell-envelope biosynthesis and polysaccharide utilization, as well as yet under-characterized pathways. Notably, one of these genes has been shown to be critical for B. fragilis colonization in mice5, indicating that key genes have not already been optimized for survival in vivo. This lack of optimization, given historical signatures of purifying selection in these genes, suggests that varying selective forces with discordant solutions act upon B. fragilis in vivo. Remarkably, in one subject, two B. fragilis sublineages coexisted at a stable relative frequency over a 1.5-year period despite rapid adaptive dynamics within one of the sublineages. This stable coexistence suggests that competing selective forces can lead to B. fragilis niche-differentiation even within a single person.

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene, as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some of which are unlikely to be causal, because they share the same variants as eQTLs. We illustrate that TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization when using expression data from tissues or cell types that are less related to the trait, due to substantial variation in both expression levels and eQTL strengths across cell types. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes at GWAS loci more accurately than simple baselines based on proximity to lead GWAS variant and expression in trait-related tissue. We discuss current strategies and future opportunities for improving the performance of TWAS for causal gene prioritization.

We use kBET to assess commonly used batch regression and normalisation approaches, and quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. Our results illustrate that batch correction based on log-transformation or scran pooling followed by ComBat reduced the batch effect while preserving structure across data sets. Finally we show that kBET can pinpoint successful data integration methods across multiple data sets, in this case from different publications all charting mouse embryonic development.

Using 2-photon calcium imaging to record from layer 23 neurons in the primary visual cortex, we found that novel images evoked excess activity in the majority of neurons. When a new stimulus sequence was repeatedly presented, a majority of neurons had similarly elevated activity for the first few presentations, which then decayed to almost zero activity. The decay time of these transient responses was not fixed, but instead scaled with the length of the stimulus sequence. However, at the same time, we also found a small fraction of the neurons within the population (∼2%) that continued to respond strongly and periodically to the repeated stimulus. Decoding analysis demonstrated that both the transient and sustained responses encoded information about stimulus identity. We conclude that the layer 23 population uses a two-channel predictive code a dense transient code for novel stimuli and a sparse sustained code for familiar stimuli.

Structural variations (SVs) incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework.

Archaeological evidence suggests the Neolithization process may have happened through the adoption of innovations by local Epipaleolithic communities, or by demic diffusion from the Eastern Mediterranean shores or Iberia. Here, we present the first analysis of individuals’ genome sequences from early and late Neolithic sites in Morocco, as well as Early Neolithic individuals from southern Iberia. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are distinct from any other reported ancient individuals and possess an endemic element retained in present-day Maghrebi populations, confirming a long-term genetic continuity in the region. Among ancient populations, Early Neolithic Moroccans are distantly related to Levantine Natufian hunter-gatherers (∼9,000 BCE) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic farmers (∼6,500 BCE). Although an expansion in Early Neolithic times is also plausible, the high divergence observed in Early Neolithic Moroccans suggests a long-term isolation and an early arrival in North Africa for this population. This scenario is consistent with early Neolithic traditions in North Africa deriving from Epipaleolithic communities who adopted certain innovations from neighbouring populations. Late Neolithic (∼3,000 BCE) Moroccans, in contrast, share an Iberian component, supporting theories of trans-Gibraltar gene flow. Finally, the southern Iberian Early Neolithic samples share the same genetic composition as the Cardial Mediterranean Neolithic culture that reached Iberia ∼5,500 BCE. The cultural and genetic similarities of the Iberian Neolithic cultures with that of North African Neolithic sites further reinforce the model of an Iberian migration into the Maghreb.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe acquisition of agricultural techniques during the so-called Neolithic revolution has been one of the major steps forward in human history. Using next-generation sequencing and ancient DNA techniques, we directly test if Neolithization in North Africa occurred through the transmission of ideas or by demic diffusion. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are composed of an endemic Maghrebi element still retained in present-day North African populations and distantly related to Epipaleolithic communities from the Levant. However, late Neolithic individuals from North Africa are admixed, with a North African and a European component.

This panorama includes coding and non-coding point mutations, copy number alterations and other genomic rearrangements of somatic origin, and potentially predisposing germline variants. We demonstrate that genomic events are at the root of virtually all tumors, with each carrying on average 4.6 driver events. Most individual tumors harbor a unique combination of drivers, and we uncover the most frequent co-occurring driver events. Half of all cancer genes are affected by several types of driver mutations.

The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the “missing heritability” problem – i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability.

Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of haplotype combinations that lead to higher penetrance of pathogenic coding variants in disease implicated genes, which provides direct evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of causal coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated that a regulatory variant can modify the penetrance of a coding variant by introducing a Mendelian SNP using CRISPRCas9 on distinct expression haplotypes and using the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout.

To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web resource that makes the majority of previously published RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at the gene count level. Such uniformly processed data enables easy integration for downstream analyses.

Though widespread, this procedure has the potential to alter downstream population genetic inferences and has received relatively little rigorous analysis. Here we use simulations and an empirical SNP dataset to demonstrate the impacts of minor allele frequency (MAF) thresholds on inference of population structure.

Here we show that elephants and their extinct relatives (Proboscideans) may have resolved Peto’s Paradox in part through re-functionalizing a leukemia inhibitory factor pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions. The LIF6 gene is transcriptionally up-regulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage, and translocates to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct Proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of large body sizes in the Proboscidean stem-lineage.

However, sometimes the appropriate entity-intervention pair may not be obvious, and the wrong choice can make an experiment worthless. We surveyed a random sample of published animal experiments from 2011 to 2016 where interventions were applied to parents but effects examined in the offspring, as regulatory authorities have provided clear guidelines on replication with such designs. We found that only 22% of studies (95% CI = 17% to 29%) replicated the correct entity-intervention pair and thus made valid statistical inferences. Approximately half of the studies (46%, 95% CI = 38% to 53%) had pseudoreplication while 32% (95% CI = 26% to 39%) provided insufficient information to make a judgement. Pseudoreplication artificially inflates the sample size, leading to more false positive results and inflating the apparent evidence supporting a scientific claim. It is hard for science to advance when so many experiments are poorly designed and analysed. We argue that distinguishing between biological units, experimental units, and observational units clarifies where replication should occur, describe the criteria for genuine replication, and provide guidelines for designing and analysing in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"What exactly is ‘N’ in cell culture and animal experiments?, bioRxiv, 2017-09-03","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/what_exactly_is_n_in_cell_culture_and_animal_experiments_24685806/"},{"date":"2017-09-01T00:00:00Z","description":"Human T cells are central to physiological immune homeostasis, which protects us from pathogens without collateral autoimmune inflammation.

In addition, the need for viral vectors has slowed down research and clinical use as their manufacturing and testing is lengthy and expensive. Genome editing brought the promise of specific and efficient insertion of large transgenes into target cells through homology-directed repair (HDR), but to date in human T cells this still requires viral transduction8, 9. Here, we developed a non-viral, CRISPR-Cas9 genome targeting system that permits the rapid and efficient insertion of individual or multiplexed large (\u0026gt;1 kilobase) DNA sequences at specific sites in the genomes of primary human T cells while preserving cell viability and function. We successfully tested the potential therapeutic use of this approach in two settings. First, we corrected a pathogenic IL2RA mutation in primary T cells from multiple family members with monogenic autoimmune disease and demonstrated enhanced signalling function. Second, we replaced the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) locus with a new TCR redirecting T cells to a cancer antigen. The resulting TCR-engineered T cells specifically recognized the tumour antigen, with concomitant cytokine release and tumour cell killing. Taken together, these studies provide preclinical evidence that non-viral genome targeting will enable rapid and flexible experimental manipulation and therapeutic engineering of primary human immune cells.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Reprogramming human T cell function and specificity with non-viral genome targeting, bioRxiv, 2017-09-01","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/reprogramming_human_t_cell_function_and_specificity_with_non-viral_genome_targeting_24597008/"},{"date":"2017-08-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Many human diseases have an underlying genetic component.

Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such ‘cycles of templated insertions’ correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer.

Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumor’s response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name our method “Tybalt” after an instigative, cat-like character who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”.

Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.ResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.AvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.frsitedownloads Contact florian.plaza-onate@inra.frSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"MSPminer abundance-based reconstitution of microbial pan-genomes from shotgun meta-genomic data, bioRxiv, 2017-08-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/mspminer_abundance-based_reconstitution_of_microbial_pan-genomes_from_shotgun_meta-genomic_data_23519793/"},{"date":"2017-08-08T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBipolar disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder that features episodes of mania and depression.

However, despite its importance, bioinformatics skills and knowledge are not well integrated in undergraduate biology education. This curricular gap prevents biology students from harnessing the full potential of their education, limiting their career opportunities and slowing genomic research innovation. To advance the integration of bioinformatics into life sciences education, a framework of core bioinformatics competencies is needed. To that end, we here report the results of a survey of life sciences faculty in the United States about teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate life scientists. Responses were received from 1,260 faculty representing institutions in all fifty states with a combined capacity to educate hundreds of thousands of students every year. Results indicate strong, widespread agreement that bioinformatics knowledge and skills are critical for undergraduate life scientists, as well as considerable agreement about which skills are necessary. Perceptions of the importance of some skills varied with the respondent’s degree of training, time since degree earned, andor the Carnegie classification of the respondent’s institution. To assess which skills are currently being taught, we analyzed syllabi of courses with bioinformatics content submitted by survey respondents. Finally, we used the survey results, the analysis of syllabi, and our collective research and teaching expertise to develop a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life sciences students. These core competencies are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they work to integrate bioinformatics into their life sciences curricula.Significance StatementBioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques from computer science and mathematics to store, manage, and analyze biological data, is becoming increasingly central to modern biology research. Given the widespread use of bioinformatics and its impacts on societal problem-solving (e.g., in healthcare, agriculture, and natural resources management), there is a growing need for the integration of bioinformatics competencies into undergraduate life sciences education. Here, we present a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate life scientists developed using the results of a large national survey and the expertise of our working group of bioinformaticians and educators.

First, the “neural code” often spans both the experimental apparatus and the brain. Second, a neural code is information only by reference to something with a known meaning, which is not the kind of information relevant for a perceptual system. Third, the causal structure of neural codes (linear, atemporal) is incongruent with the causal structure of the brain (circular, dynamic). I conclude that a causal description of the brain cannot be based on neural codes, because spikes are more like actions than hieroglyphs.Long abstract“Neural coding” is a popular metaphor in neuroscience, where objective properties of the world are communicated to the brain in the form of spikes. Here I argue that this metaphor is often inappropriate and misleading. First, when neurons are said to encode experimental parameters, the neural code depends on experimental details that are not carried by the coding variable. Thus, the representational power of neural codes is much more limited than generally implied. Second, neural codes carry information only by reference to things with known meaning. In contrast, perceptual systems must build information from relations between sensory signals and actions, forming a structured internal model. Neural codes are inadequate for this purpose because they are unstructured. Third, coding variables are observables tied to the temporality of experiments, while spikes are timed actions that mediate coupling in a distributed dynamical system. The coding metaphor tries to fit the dynamic, circular and distributed causal structure of the brain into a linear chain of transformations between observables, but the two causal structures are incongruent. I conclude that the neural coding metaphor cannot provide a basis for theories of brain function, because it is incompatible with both the causal structure of the brain and the informational requirements of cognition.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Is coding a relevant metaphor for the brain?, bioRxiv, 2017-07-28","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/is_coding_a_relevant_metaphor_for_the_brain_22679026/"},{"date":"2017-07-25T00:00:00Z","description":"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a notably complex illness with a lifetime prevalence of 14%.1 It is often chronic or recurrent and is thus accompanied by considerable morbidity, excess mortality, substantial costs, and heightened risk of suicide.2-7 MDD is a major cause of disability worldwide.8 We conducted a genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis in 130,664 MDD cases and 330,470 controls, and identified 44 independent loci that met criteria for statistical significance. We present extensive analyses of these results which provide new insights into the nature of MDD. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of MDD, and implicated prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the pathophysiology of MDD (regions exhibiting anatomical differences between MDD cases and controls). Genes that are targets of antidepressant medications were strongly enriched for MDD association signals (P=8.5×10−10), suggesting the relevance of these findings for improved pharmacotherapy of MDD. Sets of genes involved in gene splicing and in creating isoforms were also enriched for smaller MDD GWA P-values, and these gene sets have also been implicated in schizophrenia and autism. Genetic risk for MDD was correlated with that for many adult and childhood onset psychiatric disorders. Our analyses suggested important relations of genetic risk for MDD with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia the genetic basis of lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal for MDD whereas MDD and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for MDD, and a continuous measure of risk underlies the observed clinical phenotype. MDD is not a distinct entity that neatly demarcates normalcy from pathology but rather a useful clinical construct associated with a range of adverse outcomes and the end result of a complex process of intertwined genetic and environmental effects.

Despite 10-fold variation in intergenic space among species, the majority of open chromatin regions lie within 3 kb upstream of a transcription start site in all species. We find a common set of four TFs that appear to regulate conserved gene sets in the root tips of all four species, suggesting that TF-gene networks are generally conserved. Comparative ATAC-seq profiling of Arabidopsis root hair and non-hair cell types revealed extensive similarity as well as many cell type-specific differences. Analyzing TF binding sites in differentially accessible regions identified a MYB-driven regulatory module unique to the hair cell, which appears to control both cell fate regulators and abiotic stress responses.

We identify signals of polygenic adaptation for anthropometric traits including height, infant head circumference (IHC), hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Analysis of ancient DNA samples indicates that a north-south cline of height within Europe and and a west-east cline across Eurasia can be traced to selection for increased height in two late Pleistocene hunter gatherer populations living in western and west-central Eurasia. Our observation that IHC and WHR follow a latitudinal cline in Western Eurasia support the role of natural selection driving Bergmann’s Rule in humans, consistent with thermoregulatory adaptation in response to latitudinal temperature variation.Author’s Note on Failure to ReplicateAfter this preprint was posted, the UK Biobank dataset was released, providing a new and open GWAS resource.

Surprisingly, among the Scandinavian Mesolithic individuals, the genetic data display an east-west genetic gradient that opposes the pattern seen in other parts of Mesolithic Europe. This result suggests that Scandinavia was initially colonized following two different routes one from the south, the other from the northeast. The latter followed the ice-free Norwegian north Atlantic coast, along which novel and advanced pressure-blade stone-tool techniques may have spread. These two groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a genetically diverse population, which shows patterns of genetic adaptation to high latitude environments.

Each column integrates its changing input over time to learn complete predictive models of observed objects. Excitatory lateral connections across columns allow the network to more rapidly infer objects based on the partial knowledge of adjacent columns. Because columns integrate input over time and space, the network learns models of complex objects that extend well beyond the receptive field of individual cells. Our network model introduces a new feature to cortical columns. We propose that a representation of location relative to the object being sensed is calculated within the sub-granular layers of each column. The location signal is provided as an input to the network, where it is combined with sensory data. Our model contains two layers and one or more columns. Simulations show that using Hebbian-like learning rules small single-column networks can learn to recognize hundreds of objects, with each object containing tens of features. Multi-column networks recognize objects with significantly fewer movements of the sensory receptors. Given the ubiquity of columnar and laminar connectivity patterns throughout the neocortex, we propose that columns and regions have more powerful recognition and modeling capabilities than previously assumed.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Why Does the Neocortex Have Columns, A Theory of Learning the Structure of the World, bioRxiv, 2017-07-13","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/why_does_the_neocortex_have_columns_a_theory_of_learning_the_structure_of_the_world_21793154/"},{"date":"2017-07-12T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAcross academia and industry, text mining has become a popular strategy for keeping up with the rapid growth of the scientific literature.

Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 2,778 tumour samples from 2,658 donors to reconstruct the life history, evolution of mutational processes, and driver mutation sequences of 39 cancer types. The early phases of oncogenesis are driven by point mutations in a small set of driver genes, often including biallelic inactivation of tumour suppressors. Early oncogenesis is also characterised by specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma or isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. By contrast, increased genomic instability, a nearly four-fold diversification of driver genes, and an acceleration of point mutation processes are features of later stages. Copy-number alterations often occur in mitotic crises leading to simultaneous gains of multiple chromosomal segments. Timing analysis suggests that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, and in some cases decades, providing a window of opportunity for early cancer detection.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","200-500-users","2017"],"title":"The evolutionary history of 2,658 cancers, bioRxiv, 2017-07-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_evolutionary_history_of_2658_cancers_21780450/"},{"date":"2017-07-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractModels for predicting phenotypic outcomes from genotypes have important applications to understanding genomic function and improving human health.

Speed breeding can be used to achieve up to 6 generations per year for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), durum wheat (T. durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), and pea (Pisum sativum) and 4 generations for canola (Brassica napus), instead of 2-3 under normal glasshouse conditions. We demonstrate that speed breeding in fully-enclosed controlled-environment growth chambers can accelerate plant development for research purposes, including phenotyping of adult plant traits, mutant studies, and transformation. The use of supplemental lighting in a glasshouse environment allows rapid generation cycling through single seed descent and potential for adaptation to larger-scale crop improvement programs. Cost-saving through LED supplemental lighting is also outlined.

We hypothesize that the isoform-level expression data is more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment is done through utilizing multiple datasets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-Seq datasets and include over 2,000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes and, the pathological tumor stage for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each classification problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel maximum likelihood framework for fitting Lévy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both a gradual and punctuated component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fit by punctuated processes over models of gradual change, gradual stasis, and adaptive radiation.

In contrast, we find similarities in the microbiome composition of genetically unrelated individuals who share a household. We define the term biome-explainability as the variance of a host phenotype explained by the microbiome after accounting for the contribution of human genetics.

A popular approach for curated small-scale meta-analysis is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which identifies brain regions consistently activated across a selected set of experiments, such as within a functional domain or mental disorder. ALE can also be utilized in meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) to identify brain regions consistently co-activated with a seed region. Therefore, ALE aims to find consensus across experiments, treating heterogeneity across experiments as noise. However, heterogeneity within an ALE analysis of a functional domain might indicate the presence of functional sub-domains. Similarly, heterogeneity within a MACM analysis might indicate the involvement of a seed region in multiple co-activation patterns that are dependent on task contexts. Here, we demonstrate the use of the author-topic model to automatically determine if heterogeneities within ALE-type meta-analyses can be robustly explained by a small number of latent patterns. In the first application, the author-topic modeling of experiments involving self-generated thought (N = 179) revealed cognitive components fractionating the default network. In the second application, the author-topic model revealed that the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) participated in multiple task-dependent co-activation patterns (N = 323). Furthermore, the author-topic model estimates compared favorably with spatial independent component analysis in both simulation and real data. Overall, the results suggest that the author-topic model is a flexible tool for exploring heterogeneity in ALE-type meta-analyses that might arise from functional sub-domains, mental disorder subtypes or task-dependent co-activation patterns.

Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms.

Four Iron Age farmers (300-500 years old) have genetic signatures similar to present day Bantu-speakers. The genome sequence (13x coverage) of a juvenile boy from Ballito Bay, who lived ~2,000 years ago, demonstrates that southern African Stone Age hunter-gatherers were not impacted by recent admixture; however, we estimate that all modern-day Khoekhoe and San groups have been influenced by 9-22% genetic admixture from East AfricanEurasian pastoralist groups arriving \u0026gt;1,000 years ago, including the Ju|'hoansi San, previously thought to have very low levels of admixture.

In recent years, several methods have been developed to detect polygenic adaptation using loci identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world. We also provide evidence that variants associated with several traits, including height, educational attainment, and self-reported unibrow, have been influenced by polygenic adaptation in different populations during human evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Detecting polygenic adaptation in admixture graphs, bioRxiv, 2017-06-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/detecting_polygenic_adaptation_in_admixture_graphs_20819640/"},{"date":"2017-06-06T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYBrief and sustained neuronal activity patterns can have opposite effects on synaptic strength that both require activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression. However, whether distinct patterns of activity induce different sets of ARGs is unknown. In genome-scale experiments, we reveal that a neuron’s activity-pattern history can be predicted from the ARGs it expresses. Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPKERK signaling for their induction. MAPKERK mediates rapid RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters, as well as enhancer RNA induction but not histone acetylation at enhancers. Thus, the same mechanisms that establish the multi-wave temporal structure of ARG induction also enable different sets of genes to be induced by distinct activity patterns.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Distinct neuronal activity patterns induce different gene expression programs, bioRxiv, 2017-06-06","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/distinct_neuronal_activity_patterns_induce_different_gene_expression_programs_20841401/"},{"date":"2017-06-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAttention-DeficitHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable childhood behavioral disorder affecting 5% of school-age children and 2.5% of adults.

Both the maintenance and transitions of cell states are encoded by regulatory programs in the genome sequence. However, this regulatory code has not yet been exploited to guide the identification of cellular states from single-cell RNA-seq data. Here we describe a computational resource, called SCENIC (Single Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering), for the simultaneous reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and the identification of stable cell states, using single-cell RNA-seq data. SCENIC outperforms existing approaches at the level of cell clustering and transcription factor identification. Importantly, we show that cell state identification based on GRNs is robust towards batch-effects and technical-biases. We applied SCENIC to a compendium of single-cell data from the mouse and human brain and demonstrate that the proper combinations of transcription factors, target genes, enhancers, and cell types can be identified. Moreover, we used SCENIC to map the cell state landscape in melanoma and identified a gene regulatory network underlying a proliferative melanoma state driven by MITF and STAT and a contrasting network controlling an invasive state governed by NFATC2 and NFIB. We further validated these predictions by showing that two transcription factors are predominantly expressed in early metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. In summary, SCENIC is the first method to analyze scRNA-seq data using a network-centric, rather than cell-centric approach. SCENIC is generic, easy to use, and flexible, and allows for the simultaneous tracing of genomic regulatory programs and the mapping of cellular identities emerging from these programs.

The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks.When you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 31. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5 %, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.If you observe P =0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 1001 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive risk would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe P = 0.00045.It is recommended that the terms “significant” and “non-significant” should never be used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed P value.Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P \u0026lt; 0.05 as “statistically significant”. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomisation and P-hacking.

However, the Canaanites, unlike most other ancient Near Easterners of this period, left few surviving textual records and thus their origin and relationship to ancient and present-day populations remain unclear. In this study, we sequenced five whole-genomes from ~3,700-year-old individuals from the city of Sidon, a major Canaanite city-state on the Eastern Mediterranean coast. We also sequenced the genomes of 99 individuals from present-day Lebanon to catalogue modern Levantine genetic diversity. We find that a Bronze Age Canaanite-related ancestry was widespread in the region, shared among urban populations inhabiting the coast (Sidon) and inland populations (Jordan) who likely lived in farming societies or were pastoral nomads. This Canaanite-related ancestry derived from mixture between local Neolithic populations and eastern migrants genetically related to Chalcolithic Iranians. We estimate, using linkage-disequilibrium decay patterns, that admixture occurred 6,600-3,550 years ago, coinciding with massive population movements in the mid-Holocene triggered by aridification ~4,200 years ago. We show that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite-related population, which therefore implies substantial genetic continuity in the Levant since at least the Bronze Age. In addition, we find Eurasian ancestry in the Lebanese not present in Bronze Age or earlier Levantines.

Co-administration of single stranded oligonucleotide donor DNA (ssODN) during editing can result in high-efficiency (\u0026gt;20%) incorporation of ssODN sequences into the break site. This process is commonly referred to as homology directed repair (HDR) and here referred to as single stranded template repair (SSTR) to distinguish it from repair using a double stranded DNA donor (dsDonor). The high efficacy of SSTR makes it a promising avenue for the treatment of genetic diseases1,2, but the genetic basis of SSTR editing is still unclear, leaving its use a mostly empiric process. To determine the pathways underlying SSTR in human cells, we developed a coupled knockdown-editing screening system capable of interrogating multiple editing outcomes in the context of thousands of individual gene knockdowns. Unexpectedly, we found that SSTR requires multiple components of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) repair pathway, but does not require Rad51-mediated homologous recombination, distinguishing SSTR from repair using dsDonors. Knockdown of FA genes impacts SSTR without altering break repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in multiple human cell lines and in neonatal dermal fibroblasts. Our results establish an unanticipated and central role for the FA pathway in templated repair from single stranded DNA by human cells. Therapeutic genome editing has been proposed to treat genetic disorders caused by deficiencies in DNA repair, including Fanconi Anemia. Our data imply that patient genotype andor transcriptome profoundly impact the effectiveness of gene editing treatments and that adjuvant treatments to bias cells towards FA repair pathways could have considerable therapeutic value.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in human cells works via the Fanconi Anemia pathway, bioRxiv, 2017-05-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/crispr-cas9_genome_editing_in_human_cells_works_via_the_fanconi_anemia_pathway_20023519/"},{"date":"2017-05-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Bell Beaker pottery spread across western and central Europe beginning around 2750 BCE before disappearing between 2200–1800 BCE. The mechanism of its expansion is a topic of long-standing debate, with support for both cultural diffusion and human migration. We present new genome-wide ancient DNA data from 170 Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age Europeans, including 100 Beaker-associated individuals. In contrast to the Corded Ware Complex, which has previously been identified as arriving in central Europe following migration from the east, we observe limited genetic affinity between Iberian and central European Beaker Complex-associated individuals, and thus exclude migration as a significant mechanism of spread between these two regions. However, human migration did have an important role in the further dissemination of the Beaker Complex, which we document most clearly in Britain using data from 80 newly reported individuals dating to 3900–1200 BCE. British Neolithic farmers were genetically similar to contemporary populations in continental Europe and in particular to Neolithic Iberians, suggesting that a portion of the farmer ancestry in Britain came from the Mediterranean rather than the Danubian route of farming expansion. Beginning with the Beaker period, and continuing through the Bronze Age, all British individuals harboured high proportions of Steppe ancestry and were genetically closely related to Beaker-associated individuals from the Lower Rhine area. We use these observations to show that the spread of the Beaker Complex to Britain was mediated by migration from the continent that replaced \u0026gt;90% of Britain’s Neolithic gene pool within a few hundred years, continuing the process that brought Steppe ancestry into central and northern Europe 400 years earlier.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2017"],"title":"The Beaker Phenomenon and the Genomic Transformation of Northwest Europe, bioRxiv, 2017-05-12","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_beaker_phenomenon_and_the_genomic_transformation_of_northwest_europe_20019834/"},{"date":"2017-05-12T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractFarming was first introduced to southeastern Europe in the mid-7th millennium BCE – brought by migrants from Anatolia who settled in the region before spreading throughout Europe.

While discontinuity is evident in the transition to agriculture across the region, sensitive haplotype-based analyses suggest a significant degree of local hunter-gatherer contribution to later Iberian Neolithic populations. A more subtle genetic influx is also apparent in the Bronze Age, detectable from analyses including haplotype sharing with both ancient and modern genomes, D-statistics and Y-chromosome lineages. However, the limited nature of this introgression contrasts with the major Steppe migration turnovers within third Millennium northern Europe and echoes the survival of non-Indo-European language in Iberia. Changes in genomic estimates of individual height across Europe are also associated with these major cultural transitions, and ancestral components continue to correlate with modern differences in stature.Author SummaryRecent ancient DNA work has demonstrated the significant genetic impact of mass migrations from the Steppe into Central and Northern Europe during the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. In Iberia, archaeological change at the level of material culture and funerary rituals has been reported during this period, however, the genetic impact associated with this cultural transformation has not yet been estimated. In order to investigate this, we sequence Neolithic and Bronze Age samples from Portugal, which we compare to other ancient and present-day individuals. Genome-wide imputation of a large dataset of ancient samples enabled sensitive methods for detecting population structure and selection in ancient samples. We revealed subtle genetic differentiation between the Portuguese Neolithic and Bronze Age samples suggesting a markedly reduced influx in Iberia compared to other European regions.

At the heart of the field are its models, i.e. mathematical and computational descriptions of the system being studied, which map sensory stimuli to neural responses andor neural to behavioural responses. These models range from simple to complex. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to dominate several domains of artificial intelligence (AI). As the term “neural network” suggests, these models are inspired by biological brains. However, current DNNs neglect many details of biological neural networks. These simplifications contribute to their computational efficiency, enabling them to perform complex feats of intelligence, ranging from perceptual (e.g. visual object and auditory speech recognition) to cognitive tasks (e.g. machine translation), and on to motor control (e.g. playing computer games or controlling a robot arm). In addition to their ability to model complex intelligent behaviours, DNNs excel at predicting neural responses to novel sensory stimuli with accuracies well beyond any other currently available model type. DNNs can have millions of parameters, which are required to capture the domain knowledge needed for successful task performance. Contrary to the intuition that this renders them into impenetrable black boxes, the computational properties of the network units are the result of four directly manipulable elements input statistics, network structure, functional objective, and learning algorithm. With full access to the activity and connectivity of all units, advanced visualization techniques, and analytic tools to map network representations to neural data, DNNs represent a powerful framework for building task-performing models and will drive substantial insights in computational neuroscience.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Deep Neural Networks in Computational Neuroscience, bioRxiv, 2017-05-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/deep_neural_networks_in_computational_neuroscience_19858127/"},{"date":"2017-05-03T00:00:00Z","description":"1AbstractWe found tremendous inequality across gene and protein annotation resources.

The process typically involves four basic steps library preparation, cluster generation, sequencing, and data analysis. In 2015, a new chemistry of cluster generation was introduced in the newer Illumina machines (HiSeq 30004000X Ten) called exclusion amplification (ExAmp), which was a fundamental shift from the earlier method of random cluster generation by bridge amplification on a non-patterned flow cell. The ExAmp chemistry, in conjunction with patterned flow cells containing nanowells at fixed locations, increases cluster density on the flow cell, thereby reducing the cost per run. It also increases sequence read quality, especially for longer read lengths (up to 150 base pairs). This advance has been widely adopted for genome sequencing because greater sequencing depth can be achieved for lower cost without compromising the quality of longer reads. We show that this promising chemistry is problematic, however, when multiplexing samples. We discovered that up to 5-10% of sequencing reads (or signals) are incorrectly assigned from a given sample to other samples in a multiplexed pool. We provide evidence that this “spreading-of-signals” arises from low levels of free index primers present in the pool. These index primers can prime pooled library fragments at random via complementary 3’ ends, and get extended by DNA polymerase, creating a new library molecule with a new index before binding to the patterned flow cell to generate a cluster for sequencing. This causes the resulting read from that cluster to be assigned to a different sample, causing the spread of signals within multiplexed samples. We show that low levels of free index primers persist after the most common library purification procedure recommended by Illumina, and that the amount of signal spreading among samples is proportional to the level of free index primer present in the library pool. This artifact causes homogenization and misclassification of cells in single cell RNA-seq experiments. Therefore, all data generated in this way must now be carefully re-examined to ensure that “spreading-of-signals” has not compromised data analysis and conclusions. Re-sequencing samples using an older technology that uses conventional bridge amplification for cluster generation, or improved library cleanup strategies to remove free index primers, can minimize or eliminate this signal spreading artifact.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","500+-users","2017"],"title":"Index switching causes “spreading-of-signal” among multiplexed samples in Illumina HiSeq 4000 DNA sequencing, bioRxiv, 2017-04-10","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/index_switching_causes_spreading-of-signal_among_multiplexed_samples_in_illumina_hiseq_4000_dna_sequencing_18685417/"},{"date":"2017-04-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDespite the growth of Open Access, illegally circumventing paywalls to access scholarly publications is becoming a more mainstream phenomenon. The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of ˜28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons, and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","200-500-users","2017"],"title":"Looking into Pandora’s Box The Content of Sci-Hub and its Usage, bioRxiv, 2017-04-09","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/looking_into_pandoras_box_the_content_of_sci-hub_and_its_usage_18650468/"},{"date":"2017-04-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAlthough shotgun short-read sequencing has facilitated the study of strain-level architecture within complex microbial communities, existing metagenomic approaches often cannot capture structural differences between closely related co-occurring strains.

We encoded and stored 35 distinct files, totaling 200MB of data, in more than 13 million DNA oligonucleotides (about 2 billion nucleotides in total) and fully recovered the data with no bit errors, representing an advance of almost an order of magnitude compared to prior work. 6 Our data curation focused on technologically advanced data types and historical relevance, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in over 100 languages,7 a high-definition music video of the band OK Go,8 and a CropTrust database of the seeds stored in the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.9 We developed a random access methodology based on selective amplification, for which we designed and validated a large library of primers, and successfully retrieved arbitrarily chosen items from a subset of our pool containing 10.3 million DNA sequences. Moreover, we developed a novel coding scheme that dramatically reduces the physical redundancy (sequencing read coverage) required for error-free decoding to a median of 5x, while maintaining levels of logical redundancy comparable to the best prior codes. We further stress-tested our coding approach by successfully decoding a file using the more error-prone nanopore-based sequencing. We provide a detailed analysis of errors in the process of writing, storing, and reading data from synthetic DNA at a large scale, which helps characterize DNA as a storage medium and justify our coding approach. Thus, we have demonstrated a significant improvement in data volume, random access, and encodingdecoding schemes that contribute to a whole-system vision for DNA data storage.","tags":["biorxiv","bioengineering","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Scaling up DNA data storage and random access retrieval, bioRxiv, 2017-03-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/scaling_up_dna_data_storage_and_random_access_retrieval_17090763/"},{"date":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBacteria frequently engage in cross-feeding interactions that involve an exchange of metabolites with other micro- or macroorganisms. The often obligate nature of these associations, however, hampers manipulative experiments, thus limiting our mechanistic understanding of the ecophysiological consequences that result for the organisms involved. Here we address this issue by taking advantage of a well-characterised experimental model system, in which auxotrophic genotypes of E. coli derive essential amino acid from prototrophic donor cells using intercellular nanotubes. Surprisingly, donor-recipient cocultures revealed that the mere presence of auxotrophic genotypes in coculture was sufficient to increase amino acid production levels in donor cells. Subsequent experiments unravelled that this effect was due to the depletion of amino acid concentrations in the cytoplasm of donor cells, which delayed feedback inhibition of the corresponding amino acid biosynthetic pathway. This finding indicates that in newly established mutualistic associations, an intercellular regulation of exchanged metabolites can simply emerge from the architecture of the underlying biosynthetic pathways, rather than through the evolution of new regulatory mechanisms. Taken together, our results show that a single loss-of-function mutation can physiologically couple the metabolism of two cross-feeding cells in a source-sink-like relationship.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Nanotube-mediated cross-feeding couples the metabolism of interacting bacterial cells, bioRxiv, 2017-03-07","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/nanotube-mediated_cross-feeding_couples_the_metabolism_of_interacting_bacterial_cells_17064505/"},{"date":"2017-03-07T00:00:00Z","description":"Ancient DNA studies have established that European Neolithic populations were descended from Anatolian migrants who received a limited amount of admixture from resident hunter-gatherers.

Tardigrada are placed as sisters to Arthropoda and Onychophora (velvet worms) in the superphylum Ecdysozoa by morphological analyses, but many molecular phylogenies fail to recover this relationship. This tension between molecular and morphological understanding may be very revealing of the mode and patterns of evolution of major groups. Similar to bdelloid rotifers, nematodes and other animals of the water film, limno-terrestrial tardigrades display extreme cryptobiotic abilities, including anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis. These extremophile behaviors challenge understanding of normal, aqueous physiology how does a multicellular organism avoid lethal cellular collapse in the absence of liquid water? Meiofaunal species have been reported to have elevated levels of HGT events, but how important this is in evolution, and in particular in the evolution of extremophile physiology, is unclear. To address these questions, we resequenced and reassembled the genome of Hypsibius dujardini, a limno-terrestrial tardigrade that can undergo anhydrobiosis only after extensive pre-exposure to drying conditions, and compared it to the genome of Ramazzottius varieornatus, a related species with tolerance to rapid desiccation. The two species had contrasting gene expression responses to anhydrobiosis, with major transcriptional change in H. dujardini but limited regulation in R. varieornatus. We identified few horizontally transferred genes, but some of these were shown to be involved in entry into anhydrobiosis.

We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, suggesting that they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli found in wild-types.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that respondents wanted more short courses to help boost their expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation. However, it was evident that most respondents appreciated their need for training only after designing their experiments and collecting their data. This is clearly rather late in the research workflow, and suboptimal from a training perspective, as skills acquired to address a specific need at a particular time are seldom retained, engendering a cycle of low confidence in trainees. To ensure that such skill gaps do not continue to create barriers to the progress of research, we argue that universities should strive to bring their life-science curricula into the digital-data era.

We predicted spike counts in macaque motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices from standard representations of reaching kinematics, and in rat hippocampal cells from open field location and orientation. In general, the modern methods (particularly XGBoost and the ensemble) produced more accurate spike predictions and were less sensitive to the preprocessing of features.

Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. As a result, there are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. In this study, we simulated interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and hierarchy steepness affect the performance of three methods, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty in the inferred hierarchy. First, we found that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the hierarchy steepness and method used. We then show that David’s score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the two best methods, whereas the original Elo-rating and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. Finally, we propose two simple methods to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level. These uncertainty measures further allow to differentiate non-existent, very flat and highly uncertain hierarchies from intermediate, steep and certain hierarchies. Overall, we find that the methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust, even when the ratio of observed interactions to individuals is as low as 10 to 20.

Claims have also been advanced about how niche construction theory represents a substantial extension to, and re-orientation of, standard evolutionary theory, which is criticized as being narrowly gene-centric and ignoring the rich complexity and reciprocity of organism-environment interactions. We examine these claims in some detail and show that they do not stand up to scrutiny.

However, molecular genetic studies using unrelated individuals typically report a heritability estimate of around 30% for intelligence and between 0% and 15% for personality variables. Pedigree-based estimates and molecular genetic estimates may differ because current genotyping platforms are poor at tagging causal variants, variants with low minor allele frequency, copy number variants, and structural variants. Using ∼20 000 individuals in the Generation Scotland family cohort genotyped for ∼700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we exploit the high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in members of the same family to quantify the total effect of genetic variants that are not tagged in GWASs of unrelated individuals. In our models, genetic variants in low LD with genotyped SNPs explain over half of the genetic variance in intelligence, education, and neuroticism. By capturing these additional genetic effects our models closely approximate the heritability estimates from twin studies for intelligence and education, but not for neuroticism and extraversion. We then replicated our finding using imputed molecular genetic data from unrelated individuals to show that ∼50% of differences in intelligence, and ∼40% of the differences in education, can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included.

In the past few years, single cell RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the L2 stage, effectively 50-fold “shotgun cellular coverage” of the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and selective genes. Given that C. elegans is the only organism with a fully mapped cellular lineage, these data represent a rich resource for future methods aimed at defining cell types and states.

While diversity within mitotic progenitors is largely driven by cell cycle and differentiation state, we observed sparse eminence-specific transcription factor expression, which seeds the emergence of later cell diversity. Upon becoming postmitotic, cells from all eminences pass through one of three precursor states, one of which represents a cortical interneuron ground state. By integrating datasets across developmental timepoints, we identified transcriptomic heterogeneity in interneuron precursors representing the emergence of four cardinal classes (Pvalb, Sst, Id2 and Vip), which further separate into subtypes at different timepoints during development. Our analysis revealed that the ASD-associated transcription factor Mef2c discriminates early Pvalb-precursors in E13.5 cells, and removal of Mef2c confirms its essential role for Pvalb interneuron development.

The resulting collections of pairwise contacts across the genome have connected chromatin architecture to many cellular phenomena, including replication timing and gene regulation. However, high resolution (10 kb or finer) contact maps remain scarce due to the expense and time required for collection. A computational method for predicting pairwise contacts without the need to run a Hi-C experiment would be invaluable in understanding the role that 3D chromatin architecture plays in genome biology. We describe Rambutan, a deep convolutional neural network that predicts Hi-C contacts at 1 kb resolution using nucleotide sequence and DNaseI assay signal as inputs. Specifically, Rambutan identifies locus pairs that engage in high confidence contacts according to Fit-Hi-C, a previously described method for assigning statistical confidence estimates to Hi-C contacts. We first demonstrate Rambutan’s performance across chromosomes at 1 kb resolution in the GM12878 cell line. Subsequently, we measure Rambutan’s performance across six cell types. In this setting, the model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.7662 and 0.8246 and an area under the precision-recall curve between 0.3737 and 0.9008. We further demonstrate that the predicted contacts exhibit expected trends relative to histone modification ChlP-seq data, replication timing measurements, and annotations of functional elements such as promoters and enhancers. Finally, we predict Hi-C contacts for 53 human cell types and show that the predictions cluster by cellular function. [NOTE After our original submission we discovered an error in our calling of statistically significant contacts.

In our analysis of traits with observed central nervous system enrichment, we detect an enrichment of neurons over other brain cell types for several brain-related traits, enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder but excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index, and enrichments in the cortex for schizophrenia and in the striatum for migraine. In our analysis of traits with observed immunological enrichment, we identify enrichments of T cells for asthma and eczema, B cells for primary biliary cirrhosis, and myeloid cells for Alzheimer's disease, which we validated with independent chromatin data.

However, proteome heterogeneity is largely unexplored because of the limitations of existing methods for quantifying protein levels in single cells. To alleviate these limitations, we developed Single Cell ProtEomics by Mass Spectrometry (SCoPE-MS), and validated its ability to identify distinct human cancer cell types based on their proteomes. We used SCoPE-MS to quantify over a thousand proteins in differentiating mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The single-cell proteomes enabled us to deconstruct cell populations and infer protein abundance relationships. Comparison between single-cell proteomes and transcriptomes indicated coordinated mRNA and protein covariation. Yet many genes exhibited functionally concerted and distinct regulatory patterns at the mRNA and the protein levels, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms contribute to proteome remodeling during lineage specification, especially for developmental genes. SCoPE-MS is broadly applicable to measuring proteome configurations of single cells and linking them to functional phenotypes, such as cell type and differentiation potentials.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2017"],"title":"Mass-spectrometry of single mammalian cells quantifies proteome heterogeneity during cell differentiation, bioRxiv, 2017-01-25","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/mass-spectrometry_of_single_mammalian_cells_quantifies_proteome_heterogeneity_during_cell_differentiation_15734046/"},{"date":"2017-01-21T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe show here that, unlike most other prokaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins, which are DNA-guided endonucleases, the Natronobacterium gregoryi-derived Ago (NgAgo) can function as a DNA-guided endoribonuclease, cleaving RNA, rather than DNA, in a targeted manner.

Analyses of autosomes, Y and mtDNA all suggest that Denisovan and Neanderthal were archaic Africans with Eurasian admixtures and ancestors of South Asia Negritos and Aboriginal Australians. Verifying our model, we found more ancestry of Southern Chinese from Hunan in Africans relative to other East Asian groups examined.

We show in individual cells that activation only occurs after the enhancer comes into close proximity with its regulatory target and that upon dissociation transcription ceases almost immediately. We further observe distinct topological conformations of the eve locus, depending on the spatial identity of the activating stripe enhancer. In addition, long-range activation results in transcriptional competition at the endogenous eve locus, causing corresponding developmental defects.

Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions—purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary—but not deliberate—decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.Significance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action—especially the readiness potential—precede subjects’ reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions—e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but—critically—not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice.

Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network5 can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships (likelihoods) between images of read pileups around putative variant sites and ground-truth genotype calls. This approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing tools, even winning the “highest performance” award for SNPs in a FDA-administered variant calling challenge. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and even to other mammalian species, allowing non-human sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground truth data. We further show that, unlike existing tools which perform well on only a specific technology, DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, from deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics to Ion Ampliseq exomes.

In this study, we analyze whole-genome sequences of 3,514 Sardinians to address hypotheses regarding the founding of Sardinia and its relation to the peopling of Europe, including examining fine-scale substructure, population size history, and signals of admixture. We find the population of the mountainous Gennargentu region shows elevated genetic isolation with higher levels of ancestry associated with mainland Neolithic farmers and depleted ancestry associated with more recent Bronze Age Steppe migrations on the mainland. Notably, the Gennargentu region also has elevated levels of pre-Neolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry and increased affinity to Basque populations. Further, allele sharing with pre-Neolithic and Neolithic mainland populations is larger on the X chromosome compared to the autosome, providing evidence for a sex-biased demographic history in Sardinia.

To identify such cases, we analyzed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA-seq profiles from activated CD4+ T cells of up to 105 healthy donors. We found that regions of accessible chromatin (ATAC-peaks) are co-accessible at kilobase and megabase resolution, in patterns consistent with the 3D organization of chromosomes measured by in situ Hi-C in T cells. 15% of genetic variants located within ATAC-peaks affected the accessibility of the corresponding peak through disrupting binding sites for transcription factors important for T cell differentiation and activation. These ATAC quantitative trait nucleotides (ATAC-QTNs) have the largest effects on co-accessible peaks, are associated with gene expression from the same aliquot of cells, are rarely affecting core binding motifs, and are enriched for autoimmune disease variants.

Yet, genome sequencing has revealed that many mammal and bird lineages have experienced differential rates of transposable element (TE) accumulation, which would be predicted to cause substantial variation in genome size between species. Thus, we hypothesize that there has been co-variation between the amount of DNA gained by transposition and lost by deletion during mammal and avian evolution, resulting in genome size homeostasis. To test this model, we develop a computational pipeline to quantify the amount of DNA gained by TE expansion and lost by deletion over the last 100 million years (My) in the lineages of 10 species of eutherian mammals and 24 species of birds. The results reveal extensive variation in the amount of DNA gained via lineage-specific transposition, but that DNA loss counteracted this expansion to various extent across lineages. Our analysis of the rate and size spectrum of deletion events implies that DNA removal in both mammals and birds has proceeded mostly through large segmental deletions (\u0026gt;10 kb). These findings support a unified ‘accordion’ model of genome size evolution in eukaryotes whereby DNA loss counteracting TE expansion is a major determinant of genome size. Furthermore, we propose that extensive DNA loss, and not necessarily a dearth of TE activity, has been the primary force maintaining the greater genomic compaction of flying birds and bats relative to their flightless relatives.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2016"],"title":"The hidden elasticity of avian and mammalian genomes, bioRxiv, 2016-10-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/the_hidden_elasticity_of_avian_and_mammalian_genomes_12663853/"},{"date":"2016-10-15T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryDuring realistic, continuous perception, humans automatically segment experiences into discrete events.

We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship.

While these investigations continue, significant progress has been made to adapt AFNI to fix such problems. Two separate lines of changes have been made. First, a long-tailed model for the spatial correlation of the FMRI noise characterized by autocorrelation function (ACF) was developed and implemented into the 3dClustSim tool for determining the cluster-size threshold to use for a given voxel-wise threshold. Second, the 3dttest++ program was modified to do randomization of the voxel-wise t-tests and then to feed those randomized t-statistic maps into 3dClustSim directly for cluster-size threshold determination-without any spatial model for the ACF. These approaches were tested with the Beijing subset of the FCON-1000 data collection. The first approach shows markedly improved (reduced) FPR, but in many cases is still above the nominal 5%. The second approach shows FPRs clustered tightly about 5% across all per-voxel p-value thresholds ≤ 0.01. If t-tests from a univariate GLM are adequate for the group analysis in question, the second approach is what the AFNI group currently recommends for thresholding. If more complex per-voxel statistical analyses are required (where permutationrandomization is impracticable), then our current recommendation is to use the new ACF modeling approach coupled with a per-voxel p-threshold of 0.001 or below. Simulations were also repeated with the now infamously “buggy” version of 3dClustSim the effect of the bug on FPRs was minimal (of order a few percent).","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2016"],"title":"AFNI and Clustering False Positive Rates Redux, bioRxiv, 2016-07-27","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/afni_and_clustering_false_positive_rates_redux_10056612/"},{"date":"2016-07-27T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractLong sequencing reads generated by single-molecule sequencing technology offer the possibility of dramatically improving the contiguity of genome assemblies. The biggest challenge today is that long reads have relatively high error rates, currently around 15%. The high error rates make it difficult to use this data alone, particularly with highly repetitive plant genomes. Errors in the raw data can lead to insertion or deletion errors (indels) in the consensus genome sequence, which in turn create significant problems for downstream analysis; for example, a single indel may shift the reading frame and incorrectly truncate a protein sequence. Here we describe an algorithm that solves the high error rate problem by combining long, high-error reads with shorter but much more accurate Illumina sequencing reads, whose error rates average \u0026lt;1%. Our hybrid assembly algorithm combines these two types of reads to construct mega-reads, which are both long and accurate, and then assembles the mega-reads using the CABOG assembler, which was designed for long reads. We apply this technique to a large data set of Illumina and PacBio sequences from the species Aegilops tauschii, a large and highly repetitive plant genome that has resisted previous attempts at assembly. We show that the resulting assembled contigs are far larger than in any previous assembly, with an N50 contig size of 486,807.

The use of disease resistant crop varieties can be a sustainable approach to meet the food demand of the world’s growing population. However, classical plant breeding is usually laborious and time-consuming, thus hampering efficient improvement of many crops. With the advent of genome editing technologies, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas9) system, we are now able to introduce improved crop traits in a rapid and efficient manner. In this work, we genome edited durable disease resistance in tomato by modifying a specific gene associated with disease resistance. Recently, it was demonstrated that inactivation of a single gene called DMR6 (downy mildew resistance 6) confers resistance to several pathogens in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene is specifically up-regulated during pathogen infection, and mutations in the dmr6 gene results in increased salicylic acid levels. The tomato SlDMR6-1 orthologue Solyc03g080190 is also up-regulated during infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato and Phytophthora capsici. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we generated tomato plants with small deletions in the SlDMR6-1 gene that result in frameshift and premature truncation of the protein.

We constructed a statistical model that predicts whether or not SPOP is mutated in prostate cancer, given only the digital whole slide after standard hematoxylin and eosin [H\u0026amp;E] staining. Using a TCGA cohort of 177 prostate cancer patients where 20 had mutant SPOP, we trained multiple ensembles of residual networks, accurately distinguishing SPOP mutant from SPOP non-mutant patients (test AUROC=0.74, p=0.0007 Fisher’s Exact Test). We further validated our full metaensemble classifier on an independent test cohort from MSK-IMPACT of 152 patients where 19 had mutant SPOP. Mutants and non-mutants were accurately distinguished despite TCGA slides being frozen sections and MSK-IMPACT slides being formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (AUROC=0.86, p=0.0038). Moreover, we scanned an additional 36 MSK-IMPACT patients having mutant SPOP, trained on this expanded MSK-IMPACT cohort (test AUROC=0.75, p=0.0002), tested on the TCGA cohort (AUROC=0.64, p=0.0306), and again accurately distinguished mutants from non-mutants using the same pipeline. Importantly, our method demonstrates tractable deep learning in this “small data” setting of 20-55 positive examples and quantifies each prediction’s uncertainty with confidence intervals. To our knowledge, this is the first statistical model to predict a genetic mutation in cancer directly from the patient’s digitized H\u0026amp;E-stained whole microscopy slide. Moreover, this is the first time quantitative features learned from patient genetics and histology have been used for content-based image retrieval, finding similar patients for a given patient where the histology appears to share the same genetic driver of disease i.e. SPOP mutation (p=0.0241 Kost’s Method), and finding similar patients for a given patient that does not have have that driver mutation (p=0.0170 Kost’s Method).Significance StatementThis is the first pipeline predicting gene mutation probability in cancer from digitized H\u0026amp;E-stained microscopy slides. To predict whether or not the speckle-type POZ protein [SPOP] gene is mutated in prostate cancer, the pipeline (i) identifies diagnostically salient slide regions, (ii) identifies the salient region having the dominant tumor, and (iii) trains ensembles of binary classifiers that together predict a confidence interval of mutation probability. Through deep learning on small datasets, this enables automated histologic diagnoses based on probabilities of underlying molecular aberrations and finds histologically similar patients by learned genetic-histologic relationships.Conception, Writing AJS, TJF.

Reducing sample preparation costs is commonly addressed, but start-up and buy-in costs are rarely addressed. We present dual-indexing systems to address all three of these issues. By breaking the library construction process into universal, re-usable, combinatorial components, we reduce all costs, while increasing the number of samples and the variety of library types that can be combined within runs. We accomplish this by extending the Illumina TruSeq dual-indexing approach to 768 (384 + 384) indexed primers that produce 384 unique dual-indexes or 147,456 (384 × 384) unique combinations. We maintain eight nucleotide indexes, with many that are compatible with Illumina index sequences. We synthesized these indexing primers, purifying them with only standard desalting and placing small aliquots in replicate plates. In qPCR validation tests, 206 of 208 primers tested passed (99% success). We then created hundreds of libraries in various scenarios. Our approach reduces start-up and per-sample costs by requiring only one universal adapter that works with indexed PCR primers to uniquely identify samples. Our approach reduces buy-in costs because 1) relatively few oligonucleotides are needed to produce a large number of indexed libraries; and 2) the large number of possible primers allows researchers to use unique primer sets for different projects, which facilitates pooling of samples during sequencing. Our libraries make use of standard Illumina sequencing primers and index sequence length and are demultiplexed with standard Illumina software, thereby minimizing customization headaches.

First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.

In life, genetic and epigenetic networks precisely coordinate the expression of genes -- but in death, it is not known if gene expression diminishes gradually or abruptly stops or if specific genes are involved. We investigated the unwinding of the clock by identifying upregulated genes, assessing their functions, and comparing their transcriptional profiles through postmortem time in two species, mouse and zebrafish. We found transcriptional abundance profiles of 1,063 genes were significantly changed after death of healthy adult animals in a time series spanning from life to 48 or 96 h postmortem. Ordination plots revealed non-random patterns in profiles by time. While most thanatotranscriptome (thanatos-, Greek defn. death) transcript levels increased within 0.5 h postmortem, some increased only at 24 and 48 h. Functional characterization of the most abundant transcripts revealed the following categories stress, immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, transport, development, epigenetic regulation, and cancer. The increase of transcript abundance was presumably due to thermodynamic and kinetic controls encountered such as the activation of epigenetic modification genes responsible for unraveling the nucleosomes, which enabled transcription of previously silenced genes (e.g., development genes). The fact that new molecules were synthesized at 48 to 96 h postmortem suggests sufficient energy and resources to maintain self-organizing processes. A step-wise shutdown occurs in organismal death that is manifested by the apparent upregulation of genes with various abundance maxima and durations. The results are of significance to transplantology and molecular biology.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","200-500-users","2016"],"title":"Thanatotranscriptome genes actively expressed after organismal death, bioRxiv, 2016-06-11","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/thanatotranscriptome_genes_actively_expressed_after_organismal_death_8651558/"},{"date":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractRNA-guided gene drive elements could address many ecological problems by altering the traits of wild organisms, but the likelihood of global spread tremendously complicates ethical development and use. Here we detail a localized form of CRISPR-based gene drive composed of genetic elements arranged in a daisy-chain such that each element drives the next. “Daisy drive” systems can duplicate any effect achievable using an equivalent global drive system, but their capacity to spread is limited by the successive loss of non-driving elements from the base of the chain. Releasing daisy drive organisms constituting a small fraction of the local wild population can drive a useful genetic element to local fixation for a wide range of fitness parameters without resulting in global spread. We additionally report numerous highly active guide RNA sequences sharing minimal homology that may enable evolutionary stable daisy drive as well as global CRISPR-based gene drive. Daisy drives could simplify decision-making and promote ethical use by enabling local communities to decide whether, when, and how to alter local ecosystems.Author’s Summary‘Global’ gene drive systems based on CRISPR are likely to spread to every population of the target species, hampering safe and ethical use. ‘Daisy drive’ systems offer a way to alter the traits of only local populations in a temporary manner. Because they can exactly duplicate the activity of any global CRISPR-based drive at a local level, daisy drives may enable safe field trials and empower local communities to make decisions concerning their own shared environments.For more details and an animation intended for a general audience, see the summary at Sculpting Evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","synthetic-biology","0-100-users","2016"],"title":"Daisy-chain gene drives for the alteration of local populations, bioRxiv, 2016-06-08","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/daisy-chain_gene_drives_for_the_alteration_of_local_populations_8538673/"},{"date":"2016-06-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe role of the human microbiome in health and disease is increasingly appreciated.

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors.

These studies found low incidences of malignant gliomas in the brain and schwannomas in the heart of male rats exposed to RFR of the two types [Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)] currently used in U.S. wireless networks. Potentially preneoplastic lesions were also observed in the brain and heart of male rats exposed to RFR.The review of partial study data in this report has been prompted by several factors. Given the widespread global usage of mobile communications among users of all ages, even a very small increase in the incidence of disease resulting from exposure to RFR could have broad implications for public health. There is a high level of public and media interest regarding the safety of cell phone RFR and the specific results of these NTP studies. Lastly, the tumors in the brain and heart observed at low incidence in male rats exposed to GSM-and CDMA-modulated cell phone RFR in this study are of a type similar to tumors observed in some epidemiology studies of cell phone use. These findings appear to support the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) conclusions regarding the possible carcinogenic potential of RFR.2It is important to note that this document reviews only the findings from the brain and heart and is not a complete report of all findings from the NTP’s studies.

The memory unit consists of a self-targeting guide RNA (stgRNA) cassette that repeatedly directs Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 nuclease activity towards the DNA that encodes the stgRNA, thereby enabling localized, continuous DNA mutagenesis as a function of stgRNA expression. We analyze the temporal sequence evolution dynamics of stgRNAs containing 20, 30 and 40 nucleotide SDSes (Specificity Determining Sequences) and create a population-based recording metric that conveys information about the duration andor intensity of stgRNA activity.

Recent reports of severe disease associated with ZIKV, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and severe fetal abnormalities, have greatly heightened awareness. Given its recent history of rapid spread in immune naïve populations, it is anticipated that ZIKV will continue to spread in the Americas and globally in regions where competent Aedes mosquito vectors are found. Globally, dengue virus (DENV) is the most common mosquito-transmitted human flavivirus and is both well-established and the source of outbreaks in areas of recent ZIKV introduction. DENV and ZIKV are closely related, resulting in substantial antigenic overlap. Through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), anti-DENV antibodies can enhance the infectivity of DENV for certain classes of immune cells, causing increased viral production that correlates with severe disease outcomes. Similarly, ZIKV has been shown to undergo ADE in response to antibodies generated by other flaviviruses. However, response to DENV antibodies has not yet been investigated.Methodology  Principal FindingsWe tested the neutralizing and enhancing potential of well-characterized broadly neutralizing human anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies (HMAbs) and human DENV immune sera against ZIKV using neutralization and ADE assays. We show that anti-DENV HMAbs, cross-react, do not neutralize, and greatly enhance ZIKV infection in vitro. DENV immune sera had varying degrees of neutralization against ZIKV and similarly enhanced ZIKV infection.Conclusions  SignificanceOur results suggest that pre-existing DENV immunity will enhance ZIKV infection in vivo and may increase disease severity. A clear understanding of the interplay between ZIKV and DENV will be critical in informing public health responses in regions where these viruses co-circulate and will be particularly valuable for ZIKV and DENV vaccine design and implementation strategies.Author SummaryRecent reports of severe disease, including developmental problems in newborns, have greatly heightened public health awareness of Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-transmitted virus for which there is no vaccine or treatment. It is anticipated that ZIKV will continue to spread in the Americas and globally in regions where competent mosquitoes are found. Dengue virus (DENV), a closely related mosquito-transmitted virus is well-established in regions of recent ZIKV introduction and spread. It is increasingly common that individuals living in these regions may have had a prior DENV infection or may be infected with DENV and ZIKV at the same time. However, very little is known about the impact of DENV infections on ZIKV disease severity.

We exome sequenced 4,293 families with individuals with DDs, and meta-analysed these data with published data on 3,287 individuals with similar disorders. We show that the most significant factors influencing the diagnostic yield of de novo mutations are the sex of the affected individual, the relatedness of their parents and the age of both father and mother. We identified 94 genes enriched for damaging de novo mutation at genome-wide significance (P \u0026lt; 7 × 10−7), including 14 genes for which compelling data for causation was previously lacking. We have characterised the phenotypic diversity among these genetic disorders. We demonstrate that, at current cost differentials, exome sequencing has much greater power than genome sequencing for novel gene discovery in genetically heterogeneous disorders. We estimate that 42% of our cohort carry pathogenic DNMs (single nucleotide variants and indels) in coding sequences, with approximately half operating by a loss-of-function mechanism, and the remainder resulting in altered-function (e.g. activating, dominant negative). We established that most haplo insufficient developmental disorders have already been identified, but that many altered-function disorders remain to be discovered. Extrapolating from the DDD cohort to the general population, we estimate that developmental disorders caused by DNMs have an average birth prevalence of 1 in 213 to 1 in 448 (0.22-0.47% of live births), depending on parental age.Abbreviations\u003cjatsdef-list\u003e\u003cjatsdef-item\u003ePTVProtein-Truncating Variant\u003cjatsdef-item\u003e\u003cjatsdef-item\u003eDNMDe Novo Mutation\u003cjatsdef-item\u003e\u003cjatsdef-item\u003eDDDevelopmental Disorder\u003cjatsdef-item\u003e\u003cjatsdef-item\u003eDDDDeciphering Developmental Disorders study\u003cjatsdef-item\u003e\u003cjatsdef-list\u003e","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2016"],"title":"Prevalence, phenotype and architecture of developmental disorders caused by de novo mutation The Deciphering Developmental Disorders Study, bioRxiv, 2016-04-21","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/prevalence_phenotype_and_architecture_of_developmental_disorders_caused_by_de_novo_mutation_the_deciphering_developmental_disorders_study_6845275/"},{"date":"2016-04-21T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTInaccurate data in scientific papers can result from honest error or intentional falsification.

CNEs exhibit extreme levels of sequence conservation of unexplained origin, with many acting as long-range enhancers during development. Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, predicting the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation. The correspondence between GRBs and TADs suggests that TADs around developmental genes are ancient, slowly evolving genomic structures, many of which have had conserved spans for hundreds of millions of years. This relationship also explains the difference in TAD numbers and sizes between genomes. While the close correspondence between extreme conservation and the boundaries of this subset of TADs does not reveal the mechanism leading to the conservation of these elements, it provides a functional framework for studying the role of TADs in long-range transcriptional regulation.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2016"],"title":"Topologically associated domains are ancient features that coincide with Metazoan clusters of extreme noncoding conservation, bioRxiv, 2016-03-16","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/topologically_associated_domains_are_ancient_features_that_coincide_with_metazoan_clusters_of_extreme_noncoding_conservation_6195990/"},{"date":"2016-03-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMany disciplines, from human genetics and oncology to plant breeding, microbiology and virology, commonly face the challenge of analyzing rapidly increasing numbers of genomes.

ZIKV has also been reported in Africa and Asia, and in 2015 the virus spread to South America and the Caribbean. Infection with ZIKV has been associated with neurological complications including Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly, which led the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2015. To better understand the transmission dynamics of ZIKV, we used a mathematical model to examine the 2013–14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia. Our median estimates for the basic reproduction number ranged from 2.6–4.8, with an estimated 11.5% (95% CI 7.32–17.9%) of total infections reported. As a result, we estimated that 94% (95% CI 91–97%) of the total population of the six archipelagos were infected during the outbreak. Based on the demography of French Polynesia, our results imply that if ZIKV infection provides complete protection against future infection, it would take 12–20 years before there are a sufficient number of susceptible individuals for ZIKV to reemerge, which is on the same timescale as the circulation of dengue virus serotypes in the region. Our analysis suggests that ZIKV may exhibit similar dynamics to dengue virus in island populations, with transmission characterized by large, sporadic outbreaks with a high proportion of asymptomatic or unreported cases.Author SummarySince the first reported major outbreak of Zika virus disease in Micronesia in 2007, the virus has caused outbreaks throughout the Pacific and South America. Transmitted by the Aedes species of mosquitoes, the virus has been linked to possible neurological complications including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and microcephaly. To improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of Zika virus in island populations, we analysed the 2013–14 outbreak on the six major archipelagos of French Polynesia.

Such collections represent unique resources for understanding ecological, behavioral, and phylogenetic effects on the gut microbiome, especially for species of particular conservation concern. However, we do not understand whether sample storage methods confound the ability to investigate interindividual variation in gut microbiome profiles. This uncertainty arises in part because comparisons across storage methods to date generally include only a few (≤5) individuals, or analyze pooled samples. Here, we used n=52 samples from 13 rhesus macaque individuals to compare immediate freezing, the gold standard of preservation, to three methods commonly used in vertebrate field studies storage in ethanol, lyophilization following ethanol storage, and storage in RNAlater. We found that the signature of individual identity consistently outweighed storage effects alpha diversity and beta diversity measures were significantly correlated across methods, and while samples often clustered by donor, they never clustered by storage method. Provided that all analyzed samples are stored the same way, banked fecal samples therefore appear highly suitable for investigating variation in gut microbiota.

We independently sequenced the genome of H. dujardini. As expected from whole-organism DNA sampling, our raw data contained reads from non-target genomes. Filtering using metagenomics approaches generated a draft H. dujardini genome assembly of 135 Mb with superior assembly metrics to the previously published assembly. Additional microbial contamination likely remains. We found no support for extensive fHGT. Among 23,021 gene predictions we identified 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from bacteria, and 0.2% strong candidates for fHGT from non-metazoan eukaryotes. Cross-comparison of assemblies showed that the overwhelming majority of HGT candidates in the Boothby et al. genome derived from contaminants.

Because next-generation sequencing technology sequences DNA largely indiscriminately, the high proportion of exogenous DNA drastically reduces the efficiency of high-throughput sequencing for host animal genomics. In order to address this issue, we developed an inexpensive methylation-based capture method for enriching host DNA from noninvasively obtained fecal DNA samples. Our method exploits natural differences in CpG-methylation density between vertebrate and bacterial genomes to preferentially bind and isolate host DNA from majority-bacterial fecal DNA samples. We demonstrate that the enrichment is robust, efficient, and compatible with downstream library preparation methods useful for population studies (e.g., RADseq). Compared to other enrichment strategies, our method is quick and inexpensive, adding only a negligible cost to sample preparation for research that is often severely constrained by budgetary limitations. In combination with downstream methods such as RADseq, our approach allows for cost-effective and customizable genomic-scale genotyping that was previously feasible in practice only with invasive samples.

However, using published estimates of Neanderthal inbreeding and the distribution of mutational fitness effects, we infer that Neanderthals had at least 40% lower fitness than humans on average; this increased load predicts the reduction in Neanderthal introgression around genes without the need to invoke epistasis. We also predict a residual Neanderthal mutational load in non-Africans, leading to a fitness reduction of at least 0.5%. This effect of Neanderthal admixture has been left out of previous debate on mutation load differences between Africans and non-Africans. We also show that if many deleterious mutations are recessive, the Neanderthal admixture fraction could increase over time due to the protective effect of Neanderthal haplotypes against deleterious alleles that arose recently in the human population.

When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow downstream analysis.Results We introduce a novel concept, quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which it derives from the reference, RapMap— our tool implementing quasi-mapping— is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a target transcriptome substantially faster than existing alignment tools. The algorithm we employ to implement quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes advantage of the special structure of shared sequence prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate mapping information.

Furthermore we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway.

Importantly, we can visualise many proteins at endogenous expression levels and find a large fraction of them localising to subcellular compartments. Using complementation tests we demonstrate that two-thirds of the tagged proteins are fully functional. Moreover, our clones enable interaction proteomics from developing pupae and adult flies. Taken together, this resource will enable systematic analysis of protein expression and localisation in various cellular and developmental contexts.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2015"],"title":"A genome-wide resource for the analysis of protein localisation inDrosophila, bioRxiv, 2015-10-05","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/a_genome-wide_resource_for_the_analysis_of_protein_localisation_indrosophila_4584987/"},{"date":"2015-09-29T00:00:00Z","description":"In January 2014, it was reported that strong external stimuli, such as a transient low-pH stressor, was capable of inducing the reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells (Obokata et al. 2014a, b).

By incorporating features that explain this bias into transcript expression models, we greatly increase the specificity of transcript expression estimates, with more than a four-fold reduction in the number of false positives for reported changes in expression.

Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-Seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, gene expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2015"],"title":"Missing Data and Technical Variability in Single-Cell RNA- Sequencing Experiments, bioRxiv, 2015-08-26","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/missing_data_and_technical_variability_in_single-cell_rna-_sequencing_experiments_4434248/"},{"date":"2015-07-18T00:00:00Z","description":"British population history has been shaped by a series of immigrations and internal movements, including the early Anglo-Saxon migrations following the breakdown of the Roman administration after 410CE.

We use present-day genetic data to characterize the relationship of these ancient individuals to contemporary British and other European populations. By analyzing the distribution of shared rare variants across ancient and modern individuals, we find that today’s British are more similar to the Iron Age individuals than to most of the Anglo-Saxon individuals, and estimate that the contemporary East English population derives 30% of its ancestry from Anglo-Saxon migrations, with a lower fraction in Wales and Scotland. We gain further insight with a new method, rarecoal, which fits a demographic model to the distribution of shared rare variants across a large number of samples, enabling fine scale analysis of subtle genetic differences and yielding explicit estimates of population sizes and split times. Using rarecoal we find that the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxon samples are closest to modern Danish and Dutch populations, while the Iron Age samples share ancestors with multiple Northern European populations including Britain.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2015"],"title":"Iron Age and Anglo-Saxon genomes from East England reveal British migration history, bioRxiv, 2015-07-18","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/iron_age_and_anglo-saxon_genomes_from_east_england_reveal_british_migration_history_4290294/"},{"date":"2015-07-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Scientific publications enable results and ideas to be transmitted throughout the scientific community.

First, we identified 307 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) that influence multiple traits (excluding “trivial” phenotype pairs like type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose). Several loci influence a large number of phenotypes; for example, variants near the blood group gene ABO influence eleven of these traits, including risk of childhood ear infections (rs635634 log-odds ratio = 0.06, P = 1.4 × 10−8) and allergies (log-odds ratio = 0.05, P = 2.5 × 10−8), among others.

By carrying out the Nextera tagmentation reaction in small volumes, replacing costly reagents with cheaper equivalents, and omitting unnecessary steps, we achieve a cost of library preparation of $8 per sample, approximately 6 times cheaper than the widely-used Nextera XT protocol. Furthermore, our procedure takes less than 5 hours for 96 samples and uses nanograms of genomic DNA. Many hundreds of samples can then be pooled on the same HiSeq lane via custom barcodes. Our method is especially useful for re-sequencing of large numbers of full microbial or viral genomes, including those from evolution experiments, genetic screens, and environmental samples.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2015"],"title":"Inexpensive Multiplexed Library Preparation for Megabase-Sized Genomes, bioRxiv, 2015-01-17","uri":"https://carjed.github.io/audiences/reports/inexpensive_multiplexed_library_preparation_for_megabase-sized_genomes_3072330/"},{"date":"2015-01-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Inheritance-biasing “gene drives” may be capable of spreading genomic alterations made in laboratory organisms through wild populations.

Transforming the data to remove these differences has the potential to remove interesting biologically driven global variation and therefore may not be appropriate depending on the type and source of variation. Currently, it is up to the subject matter experts, for example biologists, to determine if the stated assumptions are appropriate or not.

Contamination impacts both PCR based 16S rRNA gene surveys and shotgun metagenomics.

While TEs strongly affect genome function and evolution, most currentde novoassembly approaches cannot resolve long, identical, and abundant families of TEs. Here, we applied a novel Illumina technology called TruSeq synthetic long-reads, which are generated through highly parallel library preparation and local assembly of short read data and achieve lengths of 1.5-18.5 Kbp with an extremely low error rate (∼0.03% per base).

One of the next great challenges for studying human genetics will be to acknowledge and embrace complexity. Every human is unique, and the study of human disease phenotypes (and phenotypes in general) will be greatly enriched by moving from a deterministic to a more stochasticprobabilistic model. The dichotomous distinction between simple and complex diseases is completely artificial, and we argue instead for a model that considers a spectrum of diseases that are variably manifesting in each person. The rapid adoption of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and the Internet-mediated networking of people promise to yield more insight into this century-old debate. Comprehensive ancestry tracking and detailed family history data, when combined with WGS or at least cascade-carrier screening, might eventually facilitate a degree of genetic prediction for some diseases in the context of their familial and ancestral etiologies. However, it is important to remain humble, as our current state of knowledge is not yet sufficient, and in principle, any number of nucleotides in the genome, if mutated or modified in a certain way
