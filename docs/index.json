With very little direct biological data of HIV-1 from before the 1980s, far-reaching evolutionary and epidemiological inferences regarding the long pre-discovery phase of this pandemic are based on extrapolations by phylodynamic models of HIV-1 genomic sequences gathered mostly over recent decades. Here, using a very sensitive multiplex RT-PCR assay, we screened 1,652 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens collected for pathology diagnostics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), between 1959 and 1967. We report the near-complete genome of one positive from 1966 (“DRC66”)—a non-recombinant sister lineage to subtype C that constitutes the oldest HIV-1 near-full-length genome recovered to date. Root-to-tip plots showed the DRC66 sequence is not an outlier as would be expected if dating estimates from more recent genomes were systematically biased; and inclusion of DRC66 sequence in tip-dated BEAST analyses did not significantly alter root and internal node age estimates based on post-1978 HIV-1 sequences. There was larger variation in divergence time estimates among datasets that were subsamples of the available HIV-1 genomes from 1978-2015, showing the inherent phylogenetic stochasticity across subsets of the real HIV-1 diversity. In conclusion, this unique archival HIV-1 sequence provides direct genomic insight into HIV-1 in 1960s DRC, and, as an ancient-DNA calibrator, it validates our understanding of HIV-1 evolutionary history.SignificanceInferring the precise timing of the origin of the HIVAIDS pandemic is of great importance because it offers insights into which factors did—or did not—facilitate the emergence of the causal virus. Previous estimates have implicated rapid development during the early 20th century in Central Africa, which wove once-isolated populations into a more continuous fabric. We recovered the first HIV-1 genome from the 1960s, and it provides direct evidence that HIV-1 molecular clock estimates spanning the last half-century are remarkably reliable. And, because this genome itself was sampled only about a half-century after the estimated origin of the pandemic, it empirically anchors this crucial inference with high confidence.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"A near-full-length HIV-1 genome from 1966 recovered from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, bioRxiv, 2019-07-01","uri":"/reports/a_near-full-length_hiv-1_genome_from_1966_recovered_from_formalin-fixed_paraffin-embedded_tissue_62939704/"},{"date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMany eukaryotic microbes have complex lifecycles that include both sexual and asexual phases with strict species-specificity. While the asexual cycle of the protistan parasite Toxoplasma gondii can occur in any warm-blooded mammal, the sexual cycle is restricted to the feline intestine1. The molecular determinants that identify cats as the definitive host for T. gondii are unknown. Here, we defined the mechanism of species specificity for T. gondii sexual development and break the species barrier to allow the sexual cycle to occur in mice. We determined that T. gondii sexual development occurs when cultured feline intestinal epithelial cells are supplemented with linoleic acid. Felines are the only mammals that lack delta-6-desaturase activity in their intestines, which is required for linoleic acid metabolism, resulting in systemic excess of linoleic acid2, 3. We found that inhibition of murine delta-6-desaturase and supplementation of their diet with linoleic acid allowed T. gondii sexual development in mice. This mechanism of species specificity is the first defined for a parasite sexual cycle. This work highlights how host diet and metabolism shape coevolution with microbes. The key to unlocking the species boundaries for other eukaryotic microbes may also rely on the lipid composition of their environments as we see increasing evidence for the importance of host lipid metabolism during parasitic lifecycles4, 5. Pregnant women are advised against handling cat litter as maternal infection with T. gondii can be transmitted to the fetus with potentially lethal outcomes. Knowing the molecular components that create a conducive environment for T. gondii sexual reproduction will allow for development of therapeutics that prevent shedding of T. gondii parasites. Finally, given the current reliance on companion animals to study T. gondii sexual development, this work will allow the T. gondii field to use of alternative models in future studies.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Intestinal delta-6-desaturase activity determines host range for Toxoplasma sexual reproduction, bioRxiv, 2019-07-01","uri":"/reports/intestinal_delta-6-desaturase_activity_determines_host_range_for_toxoplasma_sexual_reproduction_62936604/"},{"date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMiniaturized fluorescence microscopes (miniscopes) have been instrumental to monitor neural activity during unrestrained behavior and their open-source versions have helped to distribute them at an affordable cost.

We highlight the advantages of NINscope by performing the first simultaneous cellular resolution (dual scope) recordings from cerebellum and cerebral cortex in unrestrained mice, revealing that the activity of both regions generally precedes the onset of behavioral acceleration. We further demonstrate the optogenetic stimulation capabilities of NINscope and show that cerebral cortical activity can be driven strongly by cerebellar stimulation. To validate the performance of our miniscope to image from deep-brain regions, we recorded in the dorsal striatum and, using the IMU to assess turning movements, replicate previous studies that show encoding of action space in this subcortical region. Finally, we combine optogenetic stimulation of distinct cortical regions projecting to the dorsal striatum, to probe functional connectivity.

Previous studies have implicated the critical involvement of RNA in heritable transgenerational effects and the high degree of mobility and genomic impact of RNAs in all organisms is an attractive model for the efficient transfer of genetic information. Here we show, for the first time, robust transport of RNA from the brain of an adult male mouse to sperm, and subsequently to offspring.

To examine T2D risk in East Asian individuals, we meta-analyzed GWAS data in 77,418 cases and 356,122 controls. In the main analysis, we identified 298 distinct association signals at 178 loci, and across T2D association models with and without consideration of body mass index and sex, we identified 56 loci newly implicated in T2D predisposition. Common variants associated with T2D in both East Asian and European populations exhibited strongly correlated effect sizes. New associations include signals innear GDAP1, PTF1A, SIX3, ALDH2, a microRNA cluster, and genes that affect muscle and adipose differentiation. At another locus, eQTLs at two overlapping T2D signals act through two genes, NKX6-3 and ANK1, in different tissues. Association studies in diverse populations identify additional loci and elucidate disease genes, biology, and pathways.Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common metabolic disease primarily caused by insufficient insulin production andor secretion by the pancreatic β cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues1. Most genetic loci associated with T2D have been identified in populations of European (EUR) ancestry, including a recent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of nearly 900,000 individuals of European ancestry that identified \u0026gt;240 loci influencing the risk of T2D2. Differences in allele frequency between ancestries affect the power to detect associations within a population, particularly among variants rare or monomorphic in one population but more frequent in another3,4. Although smaller than studies in European populations, a recent T2D meta-analysis in almost 200,000 Japanese individuals identified 28 additional loci4. The relative contributions of different pathways to the pathophysiology of T2D may also differ between ancestry groups. For example, in East Asian (EAS) populations, T2D prevalence is greater than in European populations among people of similar body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference5.

To delineate the contributions of DNA damage and DNA repair deficiency to mutagenesis we sequenced 2,721 genomes of 54 C. elegans strains, each deficient for a specific DNA repair gene and wild-type, upon exposure to 12 different genotoxins. Combining genotoxins and repair deficiency leads to differential mutation rates or new mutational signatures in more than one third of experiments. Translesion synthesis polymerase deficiencies show dramatic and diverging effects. Knockout of Polκ dramatically exacerbates the mutagenicity of alkylating agents; conversely, Polζ deficiency reduces alkylation- and UV-induced substitution rates. Examples of DNA damage-repair deficiency interactions are also found in cancer genomes, although cases of hypermutation are surprisingly rare despite signs of positive selection in a number of DNA repair genes. Nevertheless, cancer risk may be substantially elevated even by small increases in mutagenicity according to evolutionary multi-hit theory.

Recently, it has been shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is frequently sequenced alongside the targeted loci in such capture experiments. Despite its broad evolutionary interest, mtDNA is rarely assembled and used in conjunction with nuclear markers in capture-based studies. Here, we developed MitoFinder, a user-friendly bioinformatic pipeline, to efficiently assemble and annotate mitogenomic data from hundreds of UCE libraries. As a case study, we used ants (Formicidae) for which 501 UCE libraries have been sequenced whereas only 29 mitogenomes are available. We compared the efficiency of four different assemblers (IDBA-UD, MEGAHIT, MetaSPAdes, and Trinity) for assembling both UCE and mtDNA loci. Using MitoFinder, we show that metagenomic assemblers, in particular MetaSPAdes, are well suited to assemble both UCEs and mtDNA. Mitogenomic signal was successfully extracted from all 501 UCE libraries allowing confirming species identification using COI barcoding. Moreover, our automated procedure retrieved 296 cases in which the mitochondrial genome was assembled in a single contig, thus increasing the number of available ant mitogenomes by an order of magnitude. By leveraging the power of metagenomic assemblers, MitoFinder provides an efficient tool to extract complementary mitogenomic data from UCE libraries, allowing testing for potential mito-nuclear discordance.

Here we present Octopi, a low-cost ($250-$500) and reconfigurable autonomous microscopy platform capable of automated slide scanning and correlated bright-field and fluorescence imaging.

We demonstrate the power of the platform by applying it to automated detection of malaria parasites in blood smears. Specifically, we discovered a spectral shift on the order of 10 nm for DAPI-stained Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites. This shift allowed us to detect the parasites with a low magnification (equivalent to 10x) large field of view (2.56 mm2) module. Combined with automated slide scanning, real time computer vision and machine learning-based classification, Octopi is able to screen more than 1.5 million red blood cells per minute for parasitemia quantification, with estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity exceeding 90% at parasitemia of 50ul and 100% for parasitemia higher than 150l.

This neuron’s neurites covered a broad swath of lateral geniculate nucleus and spanned multiple functionally distinct regions. Every one of its neurites formed synapses onto hundreds of thalamocortical cells of several different types.

To investigate the role of astrocytes in remote memory we expressed the Gi-coupled receptor hM4Di in CA1 astrocytes, allowing their manipulation by a designer drug. We discovered that astrocytic modulation during learning resulted in a specific impairment in remote, but not recent, memory recall, accompanied by decreased neuronal activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during retrieval. We revealed a massive recruitment of ACC-projecting neurons in CA1 during memory acquisition, accompanied by activation of ACC neurons. Astrocytic Gi activation disrupted CA3 to CA1 communication in-vivo, and reduced the downstream response in the ACC. This same manipulation in behaving mice induced a projection-specific inhibition of ACC-projecting CA1 neurons during learning, consequently preventing the recruitment of the ACC. Our findings suggest that the foundation of remote memory is established in the ACC during acquisition, engaging a distinct process from the one supporting consolidation of recent memory.

The prevailing approach for managing these populations is to maintain high genetic diversity, which is often equated with fitness. Increasingly, this is being done using genetic rescue, where individuals from populations with high genetic diversity are translocated to small populations with high levels of inbreeding. However, the potentially negative consequences of this approach have recently been highlighted by the demise of the gray wolf population on Isle Royale, which only briefly recovered after genetic rescue by a migrant from the large mainland wolf population and then declined to the brink of extinction. Here, we use ecologically-motivated population genetic simulations to show that extinction risk in small populations is often increased by maximizing genetic diversity but is consistently decreased by minimizing deleterious variation. Surprisingly, we find that small populations that are founded or rescued by individuals from large populations with high genetic diversity have an elevated risk of extinction due to the high levels of recessive deleterious variation harbored by large populations. By contrast, we show that genetic rescue or founding from small or moderate-sized populations leads to decreased extinction risk due to greater purging of strongly deleterious variants. Our findings challenge the traditional conservation paradigm that focuses on genetic diversity in assessing extinction risk in favor of a new view that emphasizes minimizing deleterious variation. These insights have immediate implications for managing small and isolated populations in the increasingly fragmented landscape of the Anthropocene.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"High genetic diversity can contribute to extinction in small populations, bioRxiv, 2019-06-22","uri":"/reports/high_genetic_diversity_can_contribute_to_extinction_in_small_populations_62521534/"},{"date":"2019-06-22T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTSingle neurons in visual cortex provide unreliable measurements of visual features due to their high trial-to-trial variability.

We find that more-fit strains are less robust they have distributions of fitness effects (DFEs) with lower mean and higher variance.

In this paper, we present data from the last 10 years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelor’s degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. We discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field lab, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field lab, focused on analyzing existing data sets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time sink for course preparation; and, there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how one’s course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students’ continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Teaching R in the undergraduate ecology classroom approaches, lessons learned, and recommendations, bioRxiv, 2019-06-11","uri":"/reports/teaching_r_in_the_undergraduate_ecology_classroom_approaches_lessons_learned_and_recommendations_61899821/"},{"date":"2019-06-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAs pollinator decline is increasingly reported in natural and agricultural environments, cities are perceived as shelters for pollinators because of low pesticide exposure and high floral diversity throughout the year. This has led to the development of environmental policies supporting pollinators in urban areas. However, policies are often restricted to the promotion of honey bee colony installations, which resulted in a strong increase in apiary numbers in cities. Recently, competition for floral resources between wild pollinators and honey bees has been highlighted in semi-natural contexts, but whether urban beekeeping could impact wild pollinators remains unknown. Here, we show that in the city of Paris (France), wild pollinator visitation rates is negatively correlated to honey bee colony densities present in the surrounding (500m – slope = −0.614; p = 0.001 – and 1000m – slope = −0.489; p = 0.005). More particularly, large solitary bees and beetles were significantly affected at 500m (respectively slope = −0.425, p = 0.007 and slope = - 0.671, p = 0.002) and bumblebees were significantly affected at 1000m (slope = - 0.451, p = 0.012). Further, lower interaction evenness in plant-pollinator networks was observed with honey bee colony densities within 1000 meter buffers (slope = −0.487, p = 0.008). Finally, honey bees tended to focus their foraging activity on managed rather than spontaneous plant species (student t-test, p = 0.001) whereas wild pollinators equally visited managed and spontaneous species. We advocate responsible practices mitigating the introduction of high density of hives in urban environments. Future studies are needed to deepen our knowledge about the potential negative interactions between wild and domesticated pollinators.","tags":["biorxiv","ecology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Wild pollinator activities negatively related to honey bee colony densities in urban context, bioRxiv, 2019-06-11","uri":"/reports/wild_pollinator_activities_negatively_related_to_honey_bee_colony_densities_in_urban_context_61913412/"},{"date":"2019-06-10T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractNew technologies and analysis methods are enabling genomic structural variants (SVs) to be detected with ever-increasing accuracy, resolution, and comprehensiveness.

We developed the first benchmark set for identification of both false negative and false positive germline SVs, which complements recent efforts emphasizing increasingly comprehensive characterization of SVs. To create this benchmark for a broadly consented son in a Personal Genome Project trio with broadly available cells and DNA, the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium integrated 19 sequence-resolved variant calling methods, both alignment- and de novo assembly-based, from short-, linked-, and long-read sequencing, as well as optical and electronic mapping. The final benchmark set contains 12745 isolated, sequence-resolved insertion and deletion calls ≥50 base pairs (bp) discovered by at least 2 technologies or 5 callsets, genotyped as heterozygous or homozygous variants by long reads. The Tier 1 benchmark regions, for which any extra calls are putative false positives, cover 2.66 Gbp and 9641 SVs supported by at least one diploid assembly. Support for SVs was assessed using svviz with short-, linked-, and long-read sequence data. In general, there was strong support from multiple technologies for the benchmark SVs, with 90 % of the Tier 1 SVs having support in reads from more than one technology. The Mendelian genotype error rate was 0.3 %, and genotype concordance with manual curation was \u0026gt;98.7 %.

SCoPE2 uses data-driven analytics to optimize instrument parameters for sampling more ion copies per protein, thus supporting quantification with improved count statistics. These advances enabled us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiated into macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines.

This transport across the entire airway emerges from the integrated activity of thousands of multiciliated cells, each containing hundreds of cilia, which together must coordinate their spatial arrangement, alignment and motility [2, 3]. The mechanisms of fluid transport have been studied extensively at the level of an individual cilium [4, 5], collectively moving metachronal waves [6–10], and more generally the hydrodynamics of active matter [11, 12]. However, the connection between local cilia architecture and the topology of the flows they generate remains largely unexplored. Here, we image the mouse airway from the sub-cellular (nm) to the organ scales (mm), characterising quantitatively its ciliary arrangement and the generated flows. Locally we measure heterogeneity in both cilia organisation and flow structure, but across the trachea fluid transport is coherent. To examine this result, a hydrodynamic model was developed for a systematic exploration of different tissue architectures. Surprisingly, we find that disorder enhances particle clearance, whether it originates from fluctuations, heterogeneity in multiciliated cell arrangement or ciliary misalignment. This resembles elements of ‘stochastic resonance’ [13–15] in a self-assembled biological system. Taken together, our results shed light on how the microstructure of an active carpet [16, 17] determines its emergent dynamics. Furthermore, this work is also directly applicable to human airway pathologies [1], which are the third leading cause of deaths worldwide [18].","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Multi-scale spatial heterogeneity enhances particle clearance in airway ciliary arrays, bioRxiv, 2019-06-09","uri":"/reports/multi-scale_spatial_heterogeneity_enhances_particle_clearance_in_airway_ciliary_arrays_61877693/"},{"date":"2019-06-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death 1.

A PCA on data from 1225 respondents revealed four management strategies (i.e. interventions during firework exposure) the principal components “Environmental modification” (e.g. providing a hiding place, keeping windows and blinds closed, and playing music), “FeedPlay” (providing the dog with chews, play and food during fireworks in general, as well as contingent on loud bangs), “Alternative” (use of calming neutraceuticals, pheromones, herbal products, homeopathic products, Bach flowers, and essential oils) and “Interaction” (allowing body contact, petting and talking to the dog when loud bangs occurred). To explore possible effects of these management methods on fear development, the components were correlated with a score for fear progression. Of the four components, only “FeedPlay” was statistically associated with an improvement in fear responses to fireworks. To evaluate the effectiveness of various treatment strategies, owners were asked to select from a range of options which interventions they had used and whether they considered them as effective. With prescription medication (N=202), improvements were noted by 70% of owners. While individual products were not evaluated, the reported success rates for the categories “pheromones” (N=316), “herbal products” (N=282), “neutraceuticals” (N=211), “essential oils” (N=183), “homeopathic remedies” (N=250) and “Bach flowers” (N=281) were all in the range of 27-35%, which is not higher than would be expected based on a placebo effect. 44% of respondents (N=300) deemed pressure vests as effective. Counterconditioning (providing desirable stimuli after the occurrence of noises) was the most successful training technique according to the owners (N=694), with a reported effectiveness of over 70%. Relaxation training (N=433) was reported to be almost as successful at 69%, while noise CDs (N=377) were effective in 55% of cases.

Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) citrullinates histones and is required for NET formation (NETosis) in mouse neutrophils. While the in vivo impact of NETs is accumulating, the cellular events driving NETosis and the role of PAD4 in these events are unclear. We performed high resolution time-lapse microscopy of mouse and human neutrophils (PMN) and differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) labelled with fluorescent markers of organelles and stimulated with ionomycin or lipopolysaccharides to induce NETosis. Upon stimulation, cells exhibited rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, followed by shedding of plasma membrane microvesicles, disassembly and remodeling of the microtubule and vimentin cytoskeletons, ER vesiculation, chromatin de-condensation and nuclear rounding, progressive plasma membrane and nuclear envelope (NE) permeabilization, nuclear lamin meshwork and then NE rupture to release DNA into the cytoplasm, and finally plasma membrane rupture and discharge of extracellular DNA. Inhibition of actin disassembly blocked NET release. Mouse and dHL-60 cells bearing genetic alteration of PAD4 showed that chromatin de-condensation, lamin meshwork and NE rupture and extracellular DNA release required the enzymatic and nuclear localization activities of PAD4. Thus, NETosis proceeds by a step-wise sequence of cellular events culminating in the PAD4-mediated expulsion of DNA.Significance StatementNeutrophils are white blood cells specialized as the first line of host defense in the immune system. One way they protect organisms is through NETosis, in which they expel their DNA to form a web-like trap that ensnares pathogens and promotes clotting. However, NETs also mediate sterile inflammation, causing damage to the body. We used high-resolution live-cell microscopy to perform the first systematic characterization of the timing of dynamic cellular events leading to NETosis in human and mouse neutrophils and a neutrophil-like cell line. We discovered that NETosis proceeds by a step-wise sequence of cellular events that is conserved across species, and requires the activity of the PAD4 enzyme for DNA to be released from the nucleus and cell membrane.","tags":["biorxiv","immunology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"NETosis proceeds by cytoskeleton and endomembrane disassembly and PAD4-mediated chromatin de-condensation and nuclear envelope rupture, bioRxiv, 2019-06-07","uri":"/reports/netosis_proceeds_by_cytoskeleton_and_endomembrane_disassembly_and_pad4-mediated_chromatin_de-condensation_and_nuclear_envelope_rupture_61630599/"},{"date":"2019-06-07T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe simultaneous quantification of protein and RNA makes possible the inference of past, present and future cell states from single experimental snapshots.

Yet, a comprehensive analysis of aging dynamics organism-wide is lacking. Here we performed RNA-sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the mouse lifespan. We uncover previously unknown linear and non-linear expression shifts during aging, which cluster in strikingly consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions, including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Remarkably, these gene sets are expressed similarly across tissues, differing merely in age of onset and amplitude. Especially pronounced is widespread immune cell activation, detectable first in white adipose depots in middle age. Single-cell RNA-sequencing confirms the accumulation of adipose T and B cells, including immunoglobulin J-expressing plasma cells, which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to aging of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of aging, thereby providing a foundation to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The murine transcriptome reveals global aging nodes with organ-specific phase and amplitude, bioRxiv, 2019-06-07","uri":"/reports/the_murine_transcriptome_reveals_global_aging_nodes_with_organ-specific_phase_and_amplitude_61878680/"},{"date":"2019-06-06T00:00:00Z","description":"","tags":null,"title":"About","uri":"/about/"},{"date":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Summary","uri":"/summary/"},{"date":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTNucleosomes restrict DNA accessibility throughout eukaryotic genomes, with repercussions for replication, transcription, and other DNA-templated processes.

We find that histone proteins from the archaeon Methanothermus fervidus assemble on the E. coli chromosome in vivo and protect DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion, allowing us to map binding footprints genome-wide. We provide evidence that nucleosome occupancy along the E. coli genome tracks intrinsic sequence preferences but is disturbed by ongoing transcription and replication. Notably, we show that higher nucleosome occupancy at promoters and across gene bodies is associated with lower transcript levels, consistent with local repressive effects. Surprisingly, however, this sudden enforced chromatinization has only mild repercussions for growth, suggesting that histones can become established as ubiquitous chromatin proteins without interfering critically with key DNA-templated processes.

While these assays can measure phenotypes for thousands to millions of genotypes in a single experiment, in practice these measurements are not exhaustive, so that there is a need for techniques to impute values for genotypes whose phenotypes are not directly assayed. Here we present a method based on the idea of inferring the least epistatic possible sequence-function relationship compatible with the data. In particular, we infer the reconstruction in which mutational effects change as little as possible across adjacent genetic backgrounds. Although this method is highly conservative and has no tunable parameters, it also makes no assumptions about the form that genetic interactions take, resulting in predictions that can behave in a very complicated manner where the data require it but which are nearly additive where data is sparse or absent. We apply this method to analyze a fitness landscape for protein G, showing that our technique can provide a substantially less epistatic fit to the landscape than standard methods with little loss in predictive power. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the complex structure of epistasis observed in this dataset can be well-understood in terms of a simple qualitative model consisting of three fitness peaks where the landscape is locally additive in the vicinity of each peak.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Minimum epistasis interpolation for sequence-function relationships, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02","uri":"/reports/minimum_epistasis_interpolation_for_sequence-function_relationships_61425320/"},{"date":"2019-06-02T00:00:00Z","description":"Previous research has shown that modern Eurasians interbred with their Neanderthal and Denisovan predecessors.

To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework. The KSAs and their PLDs promote scientific problem formulation and problem solving, lending the MR-Bi durability and flexibility. With its explicit developmental trajectory, the tool can be used by developing or practicing scientists to direct their (and their team’s) acquisition of new, or to deepen existing, bioinformatics KSAs. The MR-Bi can thereby contribute to the cultivation of a next generation of bioinformaticians who are able to design reproducible and rigorous research, and to critically analyze results from their own, and others’, work.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"The Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics supporting design and evaluation of career-spanning education and training, bioRxiv, 2019-06-02","uri":"/reports/the_mastery_rubric_for_bioinformatics_supporting_design_and_evaluation_of_career-spanning_education_and_training_61414123/"},{"date":"2019-06-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractFungi have been found in every marine habitat that has been explored, however, the diversity and functions of fungi in the ocean are poorly understood.

The origin of this revolution was arguably the deep learning approach by the Hinton lab in 2012, which halved the error rate of existing classifiers in the then 2-year-old ImageNet database1. In hindsight, the combination of algorithmic and hardware advances with the appearance of large and well-labeled datasets has led up to this seminal contribution.The emergence of large amounts of data from single-cell RNA-seq and the recent global effort to chart all cell types in the Human Cell Atlas has attracted an interest in deep-learning applications. However, all current approaches are unsupervised, i.e., learning of latent spaces without using any cell labels, even though supervised learning approaches are often more powerful in feature learning and the most popular approach in the current AI revolution by far.Here, we ask why this is the case. In particular we ask whether supervised deep learning can be used for cell annotation, i.e. to predict cell-type labels from single-cell gene expression profiles. After evaluating 6 classification methods across 14 datasets, we notably find that deep learning does not outperform classical machine-learning methods in the task. Thus, cell-type prediction based on gene-signature derived cell-type labels is potentially too simplistic a task for complex non-linear methods, which demands better labels of functional single-cell readouts. We, therefore, are still waiting for the “ImageNet moment” in single-cell genomics.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Deep learning does not outperform classical machine learning for cell-type annotation, bioRxiv, 2019-05-31","uri":"/reports/deep_learning_does_not_outperform_classical_machine_learning_for_cell-type_annotation_61335515/"},{"date":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundAccurately identifying SNPs from bacterial sequencing data is an essential requirement for using genomics to track transmission and predict important phenotypes such as antimicrobial resistance. However, most previous performance evaluations of SNP calling have been restricted to eukaryotic (human) data. Additionally, bacterial SNP calling requires choosing an appropriate reference genome to align reads to, which, together with the bioinformatic pipeline, affects the accuracy and completeness of a set of SNP calls obtained.This study evaluates the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines using simulated data from 254 strains of 10 clinically common bacteria and real data from environmentally-sourced and genomically diverse isolates within the genera Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Escherichia and Klebsiella.ResultsWe evaluated the performance of 41 SNP calling pipelines, aligning reads to genomes of the same or a divergent strain. Irrespective of pipeline, a principal determinant of reliable SNP calling was reference genome selection. Across multiple taxa, there was a strong inverse relationship between pipeline sensitivity and precision, and the Mash distance (a proxy for average nucleotide divergence) between reads and reference genome. The effect was especially pronounced for diverse, recombinogenic, bacteria such as Escherichia coli, but less dominant for clonal species such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.ConclusionsThe accuracy of SNP calling for a given species is compromised by increasing intra-species diversity. When reads were aligned to the same genome from which they were sequenced, among the highest performing pipelines was NovoalignGATK. However, across the full range of (divergent) genomes, among the consistently highest-performing pipelines was Snippy.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Genomic diversity affects the accuracy of bacterial SNP calling pipelines, bioRxiv, 2019-05-31","uri":"/reports/genomic_diversity_affects_the_accuracy_of_bacterial_snp_calling_pipelines_61335502/"},{"date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAligning DNA sequences to an annotated reference is a key step for genotyping in biology. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated improved inference by aligning reads to a variation graph, i.e., a reference sequence augmented with known genetic variations. Given a variation graph in the form of a directed acyclic string graph, the sequence to graph alignment problem seeks to find the best matching path in the graph for an input query sequence. Solving this problem exactly using a sequential dynamic programming algorithm takes quadratic time in terms of the graph size and query length, making it difficult to scale to high throughput DNA sequencing data. In this work, we propose the first parallel algorithm for computing sequence to graph alignments that leverages multiple cores and single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) operations. We take advantage of the available inter-task parallelism, and provide a novel blocked approach to compute the score matrix while ensuring high memory locality. Using a 48-core Intel Xeon Skylake processor, the proposed algorithm achieves peak performance of 317 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS), and demonstrates near linear weak and strong scaling on up to 48 cores. It delivers significant performance gains compared to existing algorithms, and results in run-time reduction from multiple days to three hours for the problem of optimally aligning high coverage long (PacBioONT) or short (Illumina) DNA reads to an MHC human variation graph containing 10 million vertices.AvailabilityThe implementation of our algorithm is available at \u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comParBLiSSPaSGAL\u003ehttpsgithub.comParBLiSSPaSGAL\u003cjatsext-link\u003e.

A few neuroimaging studies have demonstrated seasonal effects, but were limited by their cross-sectional design or sample sizes. Most importantly, the stability of MRI scanner hasn’t been taken into account, which may also be affected by environments. In the current study, we analyzed longitudinal resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data from eight individuals, where the participants were scanned over months to years. We applied machine learning regression to use different resting-state parameters, including amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and functional connectivity matrix, to predict different weather and environmental parameters. For a careful control, the raw EPI and the anatomical images were also used in the prediction analysis. We first found that daylight length and temperatures could be reliability predicted using cross-validation using resting-state parameters. However, similar prediction accuracies could also achieved by using one frame of EPI image, and even higher accuracies could be achieved by using segmented or even the raw anatomical images. Finally, we verified that the signals outside of the brain in the anatomical images and signals in phantom scans could also achieve higher prediction accuracies, suggesting that the predictability may be due to the baseline signals of the MRI scanner. After all, we did not identify detectable influences of weather on brain functions other than the influences on the stability of MRI scanners.

Here, we survey for phenotypic and behavioral differences between a surface population and a cave population of A. mexicanus that has recently colonized Honey Creek Cave, Comal County, Texas, likely within the last century. We found that fish from Honey Creek Cave and fish from Honey Creek surface populations differ significantly in morphological traits including length, coloration, body condition, eye size, and dorsal fin placement. Cavefish also exhibit an increased number of superficial neuromasts relative to surface fish. Behaviorally, cavefish consume fewer worms when trials are performed in both lighted and darkened conditions. Cavefish are more aggressive than surface fish and exhibit fewer behaviors associated with stress. Further in contrast to surface fish, cavefish prefer the edges to the center of an arena and are qualitatively more likely to investigate a novel object placed in the tank. While cavefish and surface fish were wild-caught and developmental environment likely play a role in shaping these differences, our work demonstrates morphological and behavioral shifts for Texas cavefish and offers an exciting opportunity for future work to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to early cave colonization.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Evidence for rapid phenotypic and behavioral change in a recently established cavefish population, bioRxiv, 2019-05-28","uri":"/reports/evidence_for_rapid_phenotypic_and_behavioral_change_in_a_recently_established_cavefish_population_61186125/"},{"date":"2019-05-28T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYMost tissue-resident macrophage (RTM) populations are seeded by waves of embryonic hematopoiesis and are self-maintained independently of a bone-marrow contribution during adulthood.

These changes triggered significant increases in population sizes and expansions over large distances. Here we investigate the population history of the Fulani, a pastoral population extending throughout the African SahelSavannah belt. Based on genome-wide analyses we propose that ancestors of the Fulani population experienced admixture between a West African group and a group carrying both European and North African ancestries. This admixture was likely coupled with newly adopted herding practices, as it resulted in signatures of genetic adaptation in contemporary Fulani genomes, including the control element of the LCT gene enabling carriers to digest lactose throughout their lives. The lactase persistence (LP) trait in the Fulani is conferred by the presence of the allele T-13910, which is also present at high frequencies in Europe. We establish that the T-13910 LP allele in Fulani individuals analysed in this study lies on a European haplotype background thus excluding parallel convergent evolution. Our findings further suggest that Eurasian admixture and the European LP allele was introduced into the Fulani through contact with a North African populations. We furthermore confirm the link between the lactose digestion phenotype in the Fulani to the MCM6LCT locus by reporting the first Genome Wide Association study (GWAS) of the lactase persistence trait.

The cause of interspecies differences in developmental time remains a mystery partly due to lack of an appropriate model system1. Since murine and human embryos differ in their sizes, geometries, and nutrients, we use in vitro differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) to compare the same type of cells between the species in similar culture conditions. As an example of well-defined developmental time, we focus on the segmentation clock, oscillatory gene expression that regulates the timing of sequential formation of body segments2–4. In this way we recapitulate the murine and human segmentation clocks in vitro, showing that the species-specific oscillation periods are derived from cell autonomous differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions. Presomitic mesoderm (PSM)-like cells induced from murine and human PSCs displayed the oscillatory expression of HES7, the core gene of the segmentation clock5,6, with oscillation periods of 2-3 hours (mouse PSM) and 5-6 hours (human PSM). Swapping HES7 loci between murine and human genomes did not change the oscillation periods dramatically, denying the possibility that interspecies differences in the sequences of HES7 loci might be the cause of the observed period difference. Instead, we found that the biochemical reactions that determine the oscillation period, such as the degradation of HES7 and delays in its expression, are slower in human PSM compared with those in mouse PSM. With the measured biochemical parameters, our mathematical model successfully accounted for the 2-3-fold period difference between mouse and human. We further demonstrate that the concept of slower biochemical reactions in human cells is generalizable to several other genes, as well as to another cell type. These results collectively indicate that differences in the speeds of biochemical reactions between murine and human cells give rise to the interspecies period difference of the segmentation clock and may contribute to other interspecies differences in developmental time.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Species-specific oscillation periods of human and mouse segmentation clocks are due to cell autonomous differences in biochemical reaction parameters, bioRxiv, 2019-05-26","uri":"/reports/species-specific_oscillation_periods_of_human_and_mouse_segmentation_clocks_are_due_to_cell_autonomous_differences_in_biochemical_reaction_parameters_61120294/"},{"date":"2019-05-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundUnique Molecular Identifiers (UMI) are used in many experiments to find and remove PCR duplicates.

Bacterial genomes from the human gut, soil, and the ocean all exhibited gaps in whole-genome average nucleotide identities (ANI) near the previously suggested species threshold of 95% ANI. While genome-wide ratios of non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide differences (dNdS) decrease until ANI values approach ∼98%, estimates for homologous recombination approached zero at ∼95% ANI, supporting breakdown of recombination due to sequence divergence as a species-forming force.

This snapshot approach only provides fragmented information of the underlying genetic makeup of the ECG. Here, we follow the effecs of individual genetic variants through the complete cardiac cycle the ECG represents. We found that genetic variants have unique morphological signatures not identfied by previous analyses. By exploiting identified abberations of these morphological signatures, we show that novel genetic loci can be identified for cardiac disorders. Our results demonstrate how an integrated approach to analyse high-dimensional data can further our understanding of the ECG, adding to the earlier undertaken snapshot analyses of individual ECG components. We anticipate that our comprehensive resource will fuel in silico explorations of the biological mechanisms underlying cardiac traits and disorders represented on the ECG. For example, known disease causing variants can be used to identify novel morphological ECG signatures, which in turn can be utilized to prioritize genetic variants or genes for functional validation. Furthermore, the ECG plays a major role in the development of drugs, a genetic assessment of the entire ECG can drive such developments.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The genetic makeup of the electrocardiogram, bioRxiv, 2019-05-25","uri":"/reports/the_genetic_makeup_of_the_electrocardiogram_61070956/"},{"date":"2019-05-24T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe predictive power of polygenic scores for some traits now rivals that of more classical phenotypic measures, and as such they have been promoted as a potential tool for genetically informed policy.

Emergence of phenotypically diverse isolates within P. aeruginosa infections has previously been reported, however, the impact of heterogeneity on social behaviors is poorly understood.

We measured social trait production and used a metagenomic approach to analyze and assess genomic changes over the duration of the evolution experiment. We found that (i) evolutionary trajectories were reproducible in independently evolving populations; (ii) over 60% of genomic diversity occurred within the first 10 days of selection. We then focused on quorum sensing (QS), a well-studied P. aeruginosa trait that is commonly mutated in strains isolated from CF lungs. We found that at the population level (i) evolution in sputum medium selected for decreased production of QS and QS-dependent traits due to accumulation of a SNP in the lasR gene; (ii) there was a significant correlation between lasR mutant frequency, the loss of protease and the 3O-C12-HSL signal, and an increase in resistance to clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics, despite no previous antibiotic exposure. Overall, our findings provide insights into the impact of allele polymorphism on the collective phenotypes of diverse P. aeruginosa populations. Further, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa population and evolutionary dynamics can impact on traits important for virulence and could also provide reasons for antibiotic resistance found in CF infections.SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of chronic infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF).

We identified a marked increase of cytotoxic CD4 T-cells (CD4 CTLs) coupled with a substantial reduction of B-cells as a novel signature of supercentenarians. Furthermore, single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing of two supercentenarians revealed that CD4 CTLs had accumulated through massive clonal expansion, with the most frequent clonotypes accounting for 15% to 35% of the entire CD4 T-cell population. The CD4 CTLs exhibited substantial heterogeneity in their degree of cytotoxicity as well as a nearly identical transcriptome to that of CD8 CTLs.

This characteristic is very unique to supercentenarians, because generally CD4 T-cells have helper, but not cytotoxic, functions under physiological conditions.

Optogenetic tools allow manipulations of genetically and spatially defined neuronal populations with excellent temporal resolution. However, the targeted neurons are coupled with other neural populations over multiple length scales. As a result, the effects of localized optogenetic manipulations are not limited to the targeted neurons, but produces spatially extended excitation and inhibition with rich dynamics. Here we benchmarked several optogenetic silencers in transgenic mice and with viral gene transduction, with the goal to inactivate excitatory neurons in small regions of neocortex. We analyzed the effects of the perturbations in vivo using electrophysiology. Channelrhodopsin activation of GABAergic neurons produced more effective photoinhibition of pyramidal neurons than direct photoinhibition using light-gated ion pumps. We made transgenic mice expressing the light-dependent chloride channel GtACR under the control of Cre-recombinase. Activation of GtACR produced the most potent photoinhibition. For all methods, localized photostimuli produced photoinhibition that extended substantially beyond the spread of light in tissue, although different methods had slightly different resolution limits (radius of inactivation, 0.5 mm to 1 mm). The spatial profile of photoinhibition was likely shaped by strong coupling between cortical neurons. Over some range of photostimulation, circuits produced the “paradoxical effect”, where excitation of inhibitory neurons reduced activity in these neurons, together with pyramidal neurons, a signature of inhibition-stabilized neural networks. The offset of optogenetic inactivation was followed by rebound excitation in a light dose-dependent manner, which can be mitigated by slowly varying photostimuli, but at the expense of time resolution. Our data offer guidance for the design of in vivo optogenetics experiments and suggest how these experiments can reveal operating principles of neural circuits.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Spatiotemporal limits of optogenetic manipulations in cortical circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-05-20","uri":"/reports/spatiotemporal_limits_of_optogenetic_manipulations_in_cortical_circuits_60710064/"},{"date":"2019-05-18T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSpecialized epitope tags are widely used for detecting, manipulating or purifying proteins, but often their versatility is limited.

Here, we used resting-state (rs-fMRI) data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE-I and II) to investigate two factors thought to strongly influence replicability the use of different denoising methods (i.e., data preprocessing) and data site (which differ in terms of sample, data acquisition parameters, etc.). Using four independently acquired datasets and 31 different denoising strategies, we examined the replicability of patterns of both group-averaged functional connectomes and group-level differences (i.e., ASD vs. control). Within datasets, both group-averages and group-comparisons of functional connectomes were highly consistent (r = 0.92 ±0.06  r = 0.80±0.09) across different pipelines, with the largest differences across pipelines reflecting whether global signal regression (GSR) was used. However, across datasets, while group-averages were still highly consistent (r = 0.86±0.02), group differences did not replicate, regardless of denoising strategy indeed, consistency of group differences was so low (r = 0.09±0.05) that differences identified in one dataset had essentially no relationship with those in other datasets. Across-site similarity remained low even when considering the data at the network (as opposed to edge) level. Because there are a number of additional methodological factors that can influence the reliable detection of group differences (e.g., scanner-related differences, subject differences, post-processing analysis, effect sizes of ASD alterations, amount and quality of data), these results cannot completely rule out the existence of replicable resting-state FC differences in ASD. However, they do highlight the importance of examining replicability in future studies of ASD, and, more generally, call for extra caution when describing and interpreting alterations in functional connectivity across groups of individuals.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Non-replication of functional connectivity differences in ASD a multi-site study, bioRxiv, 2019-05-18","uri":"/reports/non-replication_of_functional_connectivity_differences_in_asd_a_multi-site_study_60611463/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAssortative mating and other forms of partial prezygotic isolation are often viewed as being more important than partial postzygotic isolation (low fitness of hybrids) early in the process of speciation. Here we simulate secondary contact between two populations (‘species’) to examine effects of pre- and postzygotic isolation in preventing blending. A small reduction in hybrid fitness (e.g., 10%) produces a narrower hybrid zone than a strong but imperfect mating preference (e.g., 10x stronger preference for conspecific over heterospecific mates). This is because, in the latter case, rare F1 hybrids find each other attractive (due to assortative mating), leading to the gradual buildup of a full continuum of intermediates between the two species. The cline is narrower than would result from purely neutral diffusion over the same number of generations, but this effect is due to the frequency-dependent mating disadvantage of individuals of rare mating types. Hybrids tend to pay this cost of rarity more than pure individuals, meaning there is an induced postzygotic isolation effect of assortative mating. When this induced mating disadvantage is removed, partial assortative mating does not prevent eventual blending of the species. These results prompt a questioning of the concept of partial prezygotic isolation, since it is not very isolating unless there is also postzygotic isolation.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Assortative mating in hybrid zones is remarkably ineffective in promoting speciation, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17","uri":"/reports/assortative_mating_in_hybrid_zones_is_remarkably_ineffective_in_promoting_speciation_60565197/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have now been conducted for hundreds of phenotypes of relevance to human health. Many such GWAS involve multiple closely-related phenotypes collected on the same samples. However, the vast majority of these GWAS have been analyzed using simple univariate analyses, which consider one phenotype at a time. This is de-spite the fact that, at least in simulation experiments, multivariate analyses have been shown to be more powerful at detecting associations. Here, we conduct multivariate association analyses on 13 different publicly-available GWAS datasets that involve multiple closely-related phenotypes. These data include large studies of anthropometric traits (GIANT), plasma lipid traits (GlobalLipids), and red blood cell traits (HaemgenRBC). Our analyses identify many new associations (433 in total across the 13 studies), many of which replicate when follow-up samples are available. Overall, our results demonstrate that multivariate analyses can help make more effective use of data from both existing and future GWAS.1Author SummaryGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a common and powerful tool for identifying significant correlations between markers of genetic variation and physical traits of interest. Often these studies are conducted by comparing genetic variation against single traits one at a time (‘univariate’); however, it has previously been shown that it is possible to increase your power to detect significant associations by comparing genetic variation against multiple traits simultaneously (‘multivariate’). Despite this apparent increase in power though, researchers still rarely conduct multivariate GWAS, even when studies have multiple traits readily available. Here, we reanalyze 13 previously published GWAS using a multivariate method and find \u0026gt;400 additional associations. Our method makes use of univariate GWAS summary statistics and is available as a software package, thus making it accessible to other researchers interested in conducting the same analyses. We also show, using studies that have multiple releases, that our new associations have high rates of replication. Overall, we argue multivariate approaches in GWAS should no longer be overlooked and how, often, there is low-hanging fruit in the form of new associations by running these methods on data already collected.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Bayesian multivariate reanalysis of large genetic studies identifies many new associations, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17","uri":"/reports/bayesian_multivariate_reanalysis_of_large_genetic_studies_identifies_many_new_associations_60573413/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Dogs were the first domesticated animal and, according to the archaeological evidence, have had a close relationship with humans for at least 15,000 years. Today, dogs are common pets in our society and have been linked to increased well-being and improved health outcomes in their owners. A dog in the family during childhood is associated with ownership in adult life. The underlying factors behind this association could be related to experiences or to genetic influences. We aimed to investigate the heritability of dog ownership in a large twin sample including all twins in the Swedish Twin Registry born between 1926 and 1996 and alive in 2006. Information about dog ownership was available from 2001 to 2016 from national dog registers. The final data set included 85,542 twins from 50,507 twin pairs with known zygosity, where information on both twins were available in 35,035 pairs. Structural equation modeling was performed to estimate additive genetic effects (the heritability), commonshared environmental, and uniquenon-shared environmental effects. We found that additive genetic factors largely contributed to dog ownership, with heritability estimated at 57% for females and 51% for males. An effect of shared environmental factors was only observed in early adulthood. In conclusion, we show a strong genetic contribution to dog ownership in adulthood in a large twin study. We see two main implications of this finding (1) genetic variation may have contributed to our ability to domesticate dogs and other animals and (2) potential pleiotropic effects of genetic variation affecting dog ownership should be considered in studies examining health impacts of dog ownership.","tags":["scientific reports","genetics","500+-users","2019"],"title":"Evidence of large genetic influences on dog ownership in the Swedish Twin Registry has implications for understanding domestication and health associations, Scientific Reports, 2019-05-17","uri":"/reports/evidence_of_large_genetic_influences_on_dog_ownership_in_the_swedish_twin_registry_has_implications_for_understanding_domestication_and_health_associations_60582021/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYBreast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where each OncoOmics approach needs to be fully understood as a part of a complex network.

Microbial activity is a crucial component of all ecosystems, as microbes have the potential to control any major biochemical process. In recent years, considerable strides have been made in describing the community structure, i.e. diversity and abundance, of microbes from the Earth’s major biomes. In virtually all environments studied, a few highly abundant taxa dominate the structure of microbial communities. Still, microbial diversity is high and is concentrated in the less abundant, or rare, fractions of the community, i.e. the “long tail” of the abundance distribution. The relationship between microbial community structure and activity, specifically the role of rare microbes, and its connection to ecosystem function, is not fully understood. We analyzed 12.3 million metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequence assemblies and their genes from environmental, human, and engineered microbiomes, and show that microbial activity is dominated by rare microbes (96% of total activity) across all measured biomes. Further, rare microbial activity was comprised of traits that are fundamental to ecosystem and organismal health, e.g. biogeochemical cycling and infectious disease. The activity of rare microbes was also tightly coupled to temperature, revealing a link between basic biological processes, e.g. reaction rates, and community activity. Our study provides a broadly applicable and predictable paradigm that implicates rare microbes as the main microbial drivers of ecosystem function and organismal health.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Rare microbes from diverse Earth biomes dominate community activity, bioRxiv, 2019-05-17","uri":"/reports/rare_microbes_from_diverse_earth_biomes_dominate_community_activity_60565210/"},{"date":"2019-05-17T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTChromatin folding below the scale of topologically associating domains (TADs) remains largely unexplored in mammals.

The transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) carrying plasmids between bacterial species by horizontal gene transfer represents an important mode of expansion of ARGs. Here, we evaluated the application of Nanopore sequencing technology in a hospital setting for monitoring the transfer and rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance plasmids within and across multiple species.ResultsIn 2009 we experienced an outbreak with an extensively multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa harboring the carbapenemase enzyme blaIMP-8, and in 2012 the first Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter werkmanii harboring the same enzyme were detected. Using Nanopore and Illumina sequencing we conducted a comparative analysis of all blaIMP-8 bacteria isolated in our hospital over a 6-year period (n = 54). We developed the computational platforms pathoLogic and plasmIDent for Nanopore-based characterization of clinical isolates and monitoring of ARG transfer, comprising de-novo assembly of genomes and plasmids, polishing, QC, plasmid circularization, ARG annotation, comparative genome analysis of multiple isolates and visualization of results. Using plasmIDent we identified a 40 kb plasmid carrying blaIMP-8 in P. aeruginosa and C. freundii, verifying that plasmid transfer had occurred. Within C. freundii the plasmid underwent further evolution and plasmid fusion, resulting in a 164 kb mega-plasmid, which was transferred to C. werkmanii. Moreover, multiple rearrangements of the multidrug resistance gene cassette were detected in P. aeruginosa, including deletions and translocations of complete ARGs.ConclusionPlasmid transfer, plasmid fusion and rearrangement of the multidrug resistance gene cassette mediated the rapid evolution of opportunistic pathogens in our hospital.

This method, known as CRISPaint, employs CRISPR-Cas9 and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to linearize and insert donor plasmid DNA into a target genomic cut site. The inclusion of commonly used elements such as GFP on donor plasmids makes them universal, abolishing the need to create gene-specific homology arms and greatly reducing user workload. Using this method, we show robust gene-specific integration of donor plasmids in cultured cells and the fly germ line. Furthermore, we use this method to analyze gene function by fluorescently tagging endogenous proteins, disrupting gene function, and generating reporters of gene expression. Finally, we assemble a collection of donor plasmids for germ line knock-in that contain commonly used insert sequences. This method simplifies the generation of site-specific large DNA insertions in Drosophila cell lines and fly strains, and better enables researchers to dissect gene function in vivo.SummaryWe report a new homology-independent genomic knock-in method in Drosophila to insert large DNA elements into any target gene.

The participants were either healthy (N=110) or diagnosed with bipolar disorder (N=40), attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (N=37), schizophrenia (N=29) or schizoaffective disorder (N=8).

The components were robust across multiple control analyses and replicated using independent task functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the same participants. Strikingly, all three components featured connectivity alterations within the somatosensory-motor network, and its connectivity with subcortical structures and cortical executive networks.ConclusionsWe identified three distinct dimensions with dissociable (but overlapping) whole-brain RSFC signatures across healthy individuals and individuals with psychiatric illness, providing potential intermediate phenotypes that span across diagnostic categories.

Although existing methodologies can help assess whether there is sufficient read depth, they are unable to guide how many additional reads should be sequenced to reach this threshold. We provide a new method called superSeq that models the relationship between statistical power and read depth. We apply the superSeq framework to 393 RNA-Seq experiments (1,021 total contrasts) in the Expression Atlas and find the model accurately predicts the increase in statistical power gained by increasing the read depth. Based on our analysis, we find that most published studies (\u0026gt; 70%) are undersequenced, i.e., their statistical power can be improved by increasing the sequencing read depth. In addition, the extent of saturation is highly dependent on statistical methodology only 9.5%, 29.5%, and 26.6% of contrasts are saturated when using DESeq2, edgeR, and limma, respectively. Finally, we also find that there is no clear minimum per-transcript read depth to guarantee saturation for an entire technology. Therefore, our framework not only delineates key differences among methods and their impact on determining saturation, but will also be needed even as technology improves and the read depth of experiments increases.

During cell division, contractile force generated by the molecular motor myosin II (MII) at the equatorial cortex drives cleavage furrow ingression. Cleavage furrow ingression in turn increases stresses at the polar cortex, where contractility must be regulated to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis. How polar cortex contractility controls cell shape is poorly understood. We show a balance between MII paralogs allows a fine-tuning of cortex tension at the polar cortex to maintain cell shape during cytokinesis, with MIIA driving cleavage furrow ingression and bleb formation, and MIIB serving as a stabilizing motor and mediating completion of cytokinesis. As the majority of non-muscle contractile systems are cortical, this tuning mechanism will likely be applicable to numerous processes driven by MII contractility.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Precise tuning of cortical contractility regulates cell shape during cytokinesis, bioRxiv, 2019-05-13","uri":"/reports/precise_tuning_of_cortical_contractility_regulates_cell_shape_during_cytokinesis_60423481/"},{"date":"2019-05-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDefining specific protein interactions and spatially or temporally restricted local proteomes improves our understanding of all cellular processes, but obtaining such data is challenging, especially for rare proteins, cell types, or events.

However, before eDNA can establish itself as a robust alternative for mammal monitoring, comparison with existing approaches is necessary, yet has not been done. Moreover, much is unknown regarding the nature, spread and persistence of DNA shed by animals into terrestrial environments, or the optimal experimental design for understanding these potential biases.To address some of these challenges, we compared the detection of terrestrial mammals using eDNA analysis of soil samples against confirmed species observations from a long-term (∼9-yr) camera trapping study. At the same time, we considered multiple experimental parameters, including two sampling designs, two DNA extraction kits and two metabarcodes of different sizes.All mammals consistently recorded with cameras were detected in eDNA. In addition, eDNA reported many small mammals not recorded by camera traps, but whose presence in the study area is otherwise documented. A long metabarcode (≈220bp) offering a high taxonomic resolution, achieved a similar efficiency as a shorter one (≈70bp) and a phosphate buffer-based extraction gave similar results as a total DNA extraction method for a fraction of the price. Our results support that eDNA-based monitoring should become a valuable part of terrestrial mammal surveys.

Stress is a major factor inducing TE activity, however the regulatory mechanisms underlying de-repression are poorly understood. Key unresolved questions are whether different types of stress differentially induce TE activity and whether different TEs respond differently to the same stress. Plant pathogens are excellent models to dissect the impact of stress on TEs, because lifestyle transitions on and off the host impose exposure to a variety of stress conditions. We analyzed the TE expression landscape of four well-characterized strains of the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We experimentally exposed strains to nutrient starvation and host infection stress. Contrary to expectations, we show that the two distinct conditions induce the expression of different sets of TEs. In particular, the most highly expressed TEs, including MITE and LTR-Gypsy elements, show highly distinct de-repression across stress conditions. Both the genomic context of TEs and the genetic background stress (i.e. different strains harboring the same TEs) were major predictors of de-repression dynamics under stress. Genomic defenses inducing point mutations in repetitive regions were largely ineffective to prevent TE de-repression. Consistent with TE de-repression being governed by epigenetic effects, we found that gene expression profiles under stress varied significantly depending on the proximity to the closest TEs. The unexpected complexity in TE responsiveness to stress across genetic backgrounds and genomic locations shows that species harbor substantial genetic variation to control TEs.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Stress-driven transposable element de-repression dynamics in a fungal pathogen, bioRxiv, 2019-05-10","uri":"/reports/stress-driven_transposable_element_de-repression_dynamics_in_a_fungal_pathogen_60230982/"},{"date":"2019-05-10T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTA multitude of single-cell RNA sequencing methods have been developed in recent years, with dramatic advances in scale and power, and enabling major discoveries and large scale cell mapping efforts.

Pursuing the latter point, DCNNs suggest that the shape bias in children relies on representations at more advanced network layers whereas a learner that relied on lower network layers would display a color bias. These results confirm the role of natural statistics in the shape bias (i.e., shape is predictive of category membership) while highlighting that the type of statistics matter, i.e., those from lower or higher levels of representation. We use the same approach to provide evidence that pigeons performing seemingly sophisticated categorization of complex imagery may in fact be relying on representations that are very low-level (i.e., retinotopic).

However, new long-read sequencing technologies such as the Pacific Biosciences platform may provide sufficiently large sequence lengths to overcome the poor phylogenetic resolution of short amplicons. To test this idea, we amplified soil DNA and used PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) to obtain a ~4500 bp region of the eukaryotic rDNA operon spanning most of the small (18S) and large subunit (28S) ribosomal RNA genes. The CCS reads were first treated with a novel curation workflow that generated 650 high-quality OTUs containing the physically linked 18S and 28S regions of the long amplicons. In order to assign taxonomy to these OTUs, we developed a phylogeny-aware approach based on the 18S region that showed greater accuracy and sensitivity than similarity-based and phylogenetic placement-based methods using shorter reads. The taxonomically-annotated OTUs were then combined with available 18S and 28S reference sequences to infer a well-resolved phylogeny spanning all major groups of eukaryotes, allowing to accurately derive the evolutionary origin of environmental diversity. A total of 1019 sequences were included, of which a majority (58%) corresponded to the new long environmental CCS reads. Comparisons to the 18S-only region of our amplicons revealed that the combined 18S-28S genes globally increased the phylogenetic resolution, recovering specific groupings otherwise missing. The long-reads also allowed to directly investigate the relationships among environmental sequences themselves, which represents a key advantage over the placement of short reads on a reference phylogeny.

There are clear ethical, legal, and societal concerns regarding such a procedure, but these cannot be properly discussed in the absence of data on the expected outcomes of screening. Here, we use theory, simulations, and real data to evaluate the potential gain of PS-based embryo selection, defined as the expected difference in trait value between the top-scoring embryo and an average, unselected embryo. We observe that the gain increases very slowly with the number of embryos, but more rapidly with increased variance explained by the PS. Given currently available polygenic predictors and typical IVF yields, the average gain due to selection would be ≈2.5cm if selecting for height, and ≈2.5 IQ (intelligence quotient) points if selecting for cognitive function. These mean values are accompanied by wide confidence intervals; in real data drawn from nuclear families with up to 20 offspring each, we observe that the offspring with the highest PS for height was the tallest only in 25% of the families.

To determine the specific circuits within the SC that drive orienting and approach behavior toward appetitive stimuli, we explored the role of three genetically defined cell types in mediating prey capture in mice. Chemogenetic inactivation of two classically defined cell types, the wide-field (WF) and narrow-field (NF) vertical neurons, revealed that they are involved in distinct aspects of prey capture. WF neurons were required for rapid prey detection and distant approach initiation, whereas NF neurons were required for continuous and accurate orienting during pursuit.

In this study, I analyzed publicly available NIH grant information to determine the grants first-time R01 (FTR01) awardees held during their training period. Increases in the percentage of the FTR01 population that held a training award demonstrate these awards are becoming a more common component of a faculty candidate’s resume. The increase was largely due to an expansion of NIH K-series career development awards between 2000 and 2017. FTR01 awardees with a K01, K08, K23, or K99 award were overrepresented in a subset of institutions, whereas FTR01 awardees with F32 fellowships and those with no training award were evenly distributed across institutions. Finally, training awardees from top institutions were overrepresented in the faculty of the majority of institutions, echoing data from other fields where a select few institutions supply an overwhelming majority of the faculty for the rest of the field. These data give important insight into how trainees compete for NIH funding and faculty positions and how institutions prefer those with or without training awards.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The Increasing Importance of Fellowships and Career Development Awards in the Careers of Early-Stage Biomedical Academic Researchers, bioRxiv, 2019-05-03","uri":"/reports/the_increasing_importance_of_fellowships_and_career_development_awards_in_the_careers_of_early-stage_biomedical_academic_researchers_59845897/"},{"date":"2019-05-03T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryHow neural circuits develop in the human brain has remained almost impossible to study at the neuronal level.

Following maturation, human neurons transplanted in the visual cortex display tuned responses to visual stimuli that are similar to those of mouse neurons, indicating capacity for physiological synaptic integration of human neurons in mouse cortical circuits.

These “undead” neurons express a subset of olfactory receptors, enriched for recent receptor duplicates, and including those normally found in other chemosensory organs and life-stages. Moreover, undead neuron axons integrate into the olfactory circuitry in the brain.

Diverse recombination phenotypes were surprisingly coordinated donors with high average crossover rates also made a larger fraction of their crossovers in centromere-proximal regions and placed their crossovers closer together. These same relationships were also evident in the variation among individual gametes from the same donor sperm with more crossovers tended to have made crossovers closer together and in centromere-proximal regions.

We have targeted the recently discovered microglia-specific Tmem119 gene to generate knock-in mice expressing EGFP (JAX#031823) or CreERT2 (JAX#031820) for the identification and manipulation of microglia, respectively. Genetic characterization of the locus and qPCR-based analysis demonstrate correct positioning of the transgenes and intact expression of endogenous Tmem119 in the knock-in mouse models. Immunofluorescence analysis further shows that parenchymal microglia, but not other brain macrophages, are completely and faithfully labeled in the EGFP-line at different time points of development. Flow cytometry indicates highly selective expression of EGFP in CD11b+CD45lo microglia. Similarly, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses using a Cre-dependent reporter mouse line demonstrate activity of CreERT2 primarily in microglia upon tamoxifen administration with the caveat of activity in leptomeningeal cells. Finally, flow cytometric analyses reveal absence of EGFP expression and minimal activity of CreERT2 in blood monocytes of the Tmem119-EGFP and Tmem119-CreERT2 lines, respectively.

Here we propose a memory model of the hippocampus that provides a novel interpretation of place cells consistent with these observations. We hypothesize that the hippocampus is a memory device that takes advantage of the correlations between sensory experiences to generate compressed representations of the episodes that are stored in memory. A simple neural network model that can efficiently compress information naturally produces place cells that are similar to those observed in experiments. It predicts that the activity of these cells is variable and that the fluctuations of the place fields encode information about the recent history of sensory experiences.

To this end we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model maps raw sequences to representations of biological properties without labels or prior domain knowledge. The learned representation space organizes sequences at multiple levels of biological granularity from the biochemical to proteomic levels. Unsupervised learning recovers information about protein structure secondary structure and residue-residue contacts can be identified by linear projections from the learned representations. Training language models on full sequence diversity rather than individual protein families increases recoverable information about secondary structure. The unsupervised models can be adapted with supervision from quantitative mutagenesis data to predict variant activity. Predictions from sequences alone are comparable to results from a state-of-the-art model of mutational effects that uses evolutionary and structurally derived features.","tags":["biorxiv","synthetic-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences, bioRxiv, 2019-04-30","uri":"/reports/biological_structure_and_function_emerge_from_scaling_unsupervised_learning_to_250_million_protein_sequences_59705484/"},{"date":"2019-04-30T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBackgroundElevated Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels are associated with a broad range of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

Our objectives were to determine whether genetically-determined Lp(a) levels are associated with parental lifespan and to assess the association between measured and genetically-determined Lp(a) levels and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.MethodsWe determined the association between a genetic risk score of 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms weighted for their impact on Lp(a) levels (wGRS) and parental lifespan (at least one long-lived parent; father still alive and older than 90 or father’s age of death ≥90 or mother still alive and older than 93 or mother’s age of death ≥93) in 139,362 participants from the UK Biobank.

Here we developed a platform to characterize large libraries of GPCR variants in human cell lines with a barcoded transcriptional reporter of G-protein signal transduction.

We identified residues specifically important for β2AR signaling, mutations in the human population that are potentially loss of function, and residues that modulate basal activity. Using unsupervised learning, we resolve residues critical for signaling, including all major structural motifs and molecular interfaces. We also find a previously uncharacterized structural latch spanning the first two extracellular loops that is highly conserved across Class A GPCRs and is conformationally rigid in both the inactive and active states of the receptor.

First, we evaluated 1,952 publications in the peer-reviewed literature generated by exhaustive search terms that combined synonyms of “early career researcher” and “peer review” and found no previous studies about ECRs ghostwriting peer review reports. We then surveyed 498 researchers about their experiences with, and opinions about, co-reviewing and ghostwriting as ECRs. Three quarters of those surveyed have co-reviewed and most find it to be a beneficial (95% agree) and ethical (73% agree) form of training in peer review. Co-reviewing is the second most commonly reported form of training in peer review besides receiving reviews on one’s own papers. Half of survey respondents have ghostwritten a peer review report, despite the 45ths majority opinion that ghostwriting is unethical. Survey respondents report that the three major barriers to including co-reviewer names on peer review reports are a lack of communication between PIs and ECRs; a false belief that co-authorship is for manuscripts but not peer review reports; and prohibitive journal policies that are out of alignment with current practice and opinions about best practice.

Our method yielded over a thousand high quality, full-length draft virus genome sequences that could not be fully recovered using short read assembly approaches applied to the same samples. Additionally, novel DNA sequences were discovered whose repeat structures, gene contents and concatemer lengths suggested that they represent phage-inducible chromosomal islands that were packaged as concatemers within phage particles. Our new approach provided novel insight into genome structures, population biology, and ecology of naturally occurring viruses and viral parasites.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Assembly-free single-molecule nanopore sequencing recovers complete virus genomes from natural microbial communities, bioRxiv, 2019-04-26","uri":"/reports/assembly-free_single-molecule_nanopore_sequencing_recovers_complete_virus_genomes_from_natural_microbial_communities_59546075/"},{"date":"2019-04-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) organises the genome in 3D through DNA loops and in 1D by setting boundaries isolating different chromatin states, but these processes are not well understood.

We found that the chromatin boundary near CTCF is created by the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) asymmetrically located \u0026gt;40 nucleotides 5’-upstream from the centre of CTCF motif. The strength of CTCF binding to DNA is correlated with the decrease of NRL near CTCF and anti-correlated with the level of asymmetry of the nucleosome array. Individual chromatin remodellers have different contributions, with Snf2h having the strongest effect on the NRL decrease near CTCF and Chd4 playing a major role in the symmetry breaking. Upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells to neural progenitor cells and embryonic fibroblasts, a subset of common CTCF sites preserved in all three cell types maintains a relatively small local NRL despite genome-wide NRL increase.

Competent bacteria are able to absorb free DNA from their surroundings and exchange this DNA against pieces of their own genome when sufficiently homologous. And while it is known that transformation contributes to evolution and pathogen emergence in bacteria, there are still questions regarding the general prevalence of non-degraded DNA with sufficient coding capacity. In this context, we previously showed that the naturally competent bacterium Vibrio cholerae uses its type VI secretion system (T6SS) to actively acquire DNA from non-kin neighbors under chitin-colonizing conditions. We therefore sought to further explore the role of the T6SS in acquiring DNA, the condition of the DNA released through T6SS-mediated killing versus passive cell lysis, and the extent of the transfers that occur due to these conditions. To do this, we herein measured the frequency and the extent of genetic exchanges in bacterial co-cultures on competence-inducing chitin under various DNA-acquisition conditions. We show that competent V. cholerae strains acquire DNA fragments with an average and maximum length exceeding 50 kbp and 150 kbp, respectively, and that the T6SS is of prime importance for such HGT events. Collectively, our data support the notion that the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae fosters HGT and that the coding capacity of the exchanged genetic material is sufficient to significantly accelerate bacterial evolution.Significance StatementDNA shuffled from one organism to another in an inheritable manner is a common feature of prokaryotes. It is a significant mechanism by which bacteria acquire new phenotypes, for example by first absorbing foreign DNA and then recombining it into their genome. In this study, we show the remarkable extent of the exchanged genetic material, frequently exceeding 150 genes in a seemingly single transfer event, in Vibrio cholerae. We also show that to best preserve its length and quality, bacteria mainly acquire this DNA by killing adjacent, healthy neighbors then immediately absorbing the released DNA before it can be degraded. These new insights into this prey-killing DNA acquisition process shed light on how bacterial species evolve in the wild.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Neighbor predation linked to natural competence fosters the transfer of large genomic regions in Vibrio cholerae, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25","uri":"/reports/neighbor_predation_linked_to_natural_competence_fosters_the_transfer_of_large_genomic_regions_in_vibrio_cholerae_59471825/"},{"date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractLong arrays of simple, tandemly repeated DNA sequences (known as satellites) are enriched in centromeres1 and pericentromeric regions2, and contribute to chromosome segregation and other heterochromatin functions3,4.

Satellite transcription andor RNAs may also promote centromere and heterochromatin activities 8-12. However, we lack direct evidence that satellite DNA transcripts are required for normal cell or organismal functions. Here, we show that satellite RNAs derived from AAGAG tandem repeats are transcribed in many cell types throughout Drosophila melanogaster development, enriched in neuronal tissues and testes, localized within heterochromatic regions, and important for viability. Strikingly, we find that AAGAG transcripts are necessary for male fertility and are specifically required for normal histone-protamine exchange and sperm chromatin organization. Since AAGAG RNA-dependent events happen late in spermatogenesis when the transcripts are not detected, we speculate that AAGAG RNA functions in primary spermatocytes to ‘prime’ post-meiosis steps in sperm maturation. In addition to demonstrating specific essential functions for AAGAG RNAs, comparisons between closely related Drosophila species suggest that satellite repeats and their transcription evolve quickly to generate new functions.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"RNA transcribed from heterochromatic simple-tandem repeats are required for male fertility and histone-protamine exchange in Drosophila melanogaster, bioRxiv, 2019-04-25","uri":"/reports/rna_transcribed_from_heterochromatic_simple-tandem_repeats_are_required_for_male_fertility_and_histone-protamine_exchange_in_drosophila_melanogaster_59473338/"},{"date":"2019-04-25T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTThe gut microbiota influences the development and homeostasis of the mammalian immune system1–3 and can alter immune cell compositions in mice4–7.

However, whether these interactions are a significant driver of natural biodiversity is not well understood. Two contrasting hypotheses have been put forward to explain how species interactions could influence diversification. ‘Ecological Controls’ (EC) predicts a negative diversity-diversification relationship, where the evolution of novel types becomes constrained as available niches become filled5. In contrast, ‘Diversity Begets Diversity’ (DBD) predicts a positive relationship, with diversity promoting diversification via niche construction and other species interactions6. Using the Earth Microbiome Project, the largest standardized survey of global biodiversity to date7, we provide support for DBD as the dominant driver of microbiome diversity. Only in the most diverse microbiomes does DBD reach a plateau, consistent with increasingly saturated niche space. Genera that are strongly associated with a particular biome show a stronger DBD relationship than non-residents, consistent with prolonged evolutionary interactions driving diversification. Genera with larger genomes also experience a stronger DBD response, which could be due to a higher potential for metabolic interactions and niche construction offered by more diverse gene repertoires. Our results demonstrate that the rate at which microbiomes accumulate diversity is crucially dependent on resident diversity. This fits a scenario in which species interactions are important drivers of microbiome diversity.

Concurrently, wing length – which impacts nearly all aspects of avian ecology and behavior – has consistently increased across taxa. Our findings suggest that warming-induced body size reduction is a general response to climate change, and reveal a similarly consistent shift in an ecologically-important dimension of body shape. We hypothesize that increasing wing length represents a compensatory adaptation to maintain migration as reductions in body size have increased the metabolic cost of flight.

Further, finding the genes that underlie the GWAS signals remains a major challenge. Here, we use a unique model system to disentangle the contributions of common and rare variants to a large number of quantitative traits.

We combined our results with sequencing data for 1,011 yeast isolates3 to decouple variant effect size estimation from allele frequency and showed that rare variants make a disproportionate contribution to trait variation as a consequence of their larger effect sizes.

While recent years have seen the development of a variety of remarkable molecular tools for the study of neural circuits, their utility is currently limited by the inability to deploy them in specific elements of native neural circuits, i.e. particular neuronal subtypes. One can obtain a degree of specificity with neuron-specific promoters, but native promoters are almost never sufficiently specific restricting this approach to transgenic animals. We recently showed that one can obtain transgenic mice with augmented anatomical specificity in targeted brain regions by identifying cis-regulatory elements (i.e. enhancers) uniquely active in those brain regions and combining them with a heterologous promoter, an approach we call EDGE (Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression). Here we extend this strategy to the generation of viral (rAAV) vectors, showing that when combined with the right minimal promoter they largely recapitulate the specificity seen in the corresponding transgenic lines in wildtype animals, even of another species. Because active enhancers can be identified in any tissue sample, this approach promises to enable the kind of circuit-specific manipulations in any species.

Similar to how a reference genome sequence revolutionized human genetics, a reference map of the human interactome network is critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here we present the first human “all-by-all” binary reference interactome map, or “HuRI”. With ~53,000 high-quality protein-protein interactions (PPIs), HuRI is approximately four times larger than the information curated from small-scale studies available in the literature. Integrating HuRI with genome, transcriptome and proteome data enables the study of cellular function within essentially any physiological or pathological cellular context. We demonstrate the use of HuRI in identifying specific subcellular roles of PPIs and protein function modulation via splicing during brain development. Inferred tissue-specific networks reveal general principles for the formation of cellular context-specific functions and elucidate potential molecular mechanisms underlying tissue-specific phenotypes of Mendelian diseases. HuRI thus represents an unprecedented, systematic reference linking genomic variation to phenotypic outcomes.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"A reference map of the human protein interactome, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"/reports/a_reference_map_of_the_human_protein_interactome_58852789/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMost bacteria in nature exist in aggregated communities known as biofilms. Bacteria within biofilms are inherently highly resistant to antibiotics. Current understanding of the evolution and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance is largely derived from work from cells in liquid culture and it is unclear whether biofilms adapt and evolve in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of drugs. Here we used a biofilm evolution model to show that biofilms of a model food borne pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium rapidly evolve in response to exposure to three clinically important antibiotics. Whilst the model strongly selected for improved biofilm formation in the absence of any drug, once antibiotics were introduced the need to adapt to the drug was more important than the selection for improved biofilm formation. Adaptation to antibiotic stress imposed a marked cost in biofilm formation, particularly evident for populations exposed to cefotaxime and azithromycin. We identified distinct resistance phenotypes in biofilms compared to corresponding planktonic control cultures and characterised new mechanisms of resistance to cefotaxime and azithromycin. Novel substitutions within the multidrug efflux transporter, AcrB were identified and validated as impacting drug export as well as changes in regulators of this efflux system. There were clear fitness costs identified and associated with different evolutionary trajectories. Our results demonstrate that biofilms adapt rapidly to low concentrations of antibiotics and the mechanisms of adaptation are novel. This work will be a starting point for studies to further examine biofilm specific pathways of adaptation which inform future antibiotic use.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Antibiotics select for novel pathways of resistance in biofilms, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"/reports/antibiotics_select_for_novel_pathways_of_resistance_in_biofilms_58836429/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolygenic scores are a popular tool for prediction of complex traits. However, prediction estimates in samples of unrelated participants can include effects of population stratification, assortative mating and environmentally mediated parental genetic effects, a form of genotype-environment correlation (rGE). Comparing genome-wide polygenic score (GPS) predictions in unrelated individuals with predictions between siblings in a within-family design is a powerful approach to identify these different sources of prediction. Here, we compared within- to between-family GPS predictions of eight life outcomes (anthropometric, cognitive, personality and health) for eight corresponding GPSs. The outcomes were assessed in up to 2,366 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs from the Twins Early Development Study from age 12 to age 21. To account for family clustering, we used mixed-effects modelling, simultaneously estimating within- and between-family effects for target- and cross-trait GPS prediction of the outcomes. There were three main findings (1) DZ twin GPS differences predicted DZ differences in height, BMI, intelligence, educational achievement and ADHD symptoms; (2) target and cross-trait analyses indicated that GPS prediction estimates for cognitive traits (intelligence and educational achievement) were on average 60% greater between families than within families, but this was not the case for non-cognitive traits; and (3) this within- and between-family difference for cognitive traits disappeared after controlling for family socio-economic status (SES), suggesting that SES is a source of between-family prediction through rGE mechanisms. These results provide novel insights into the patterns by which rGE contributes to GPS prediction, while ruling out confounding due to population stratification and assortative mating.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Comparing within- and between-family polygenic score prediction, bioRxiv, 2019-04-11","uri":"/reports/comparing_within-_and_between-family_polygenic_score_prediction_58836801/"},{"date":"2019-04-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSummarychromoMap is an R package for constructing interactive visualizations of chromosomeschromosomal regions, and mapping of chromosomal elements (like genes) onto them, of any living organism.

Through simulated psychophysics, we reproduce the defensive startle reflex and commonly reported effects linking the cardiac cycle to fear perception. We further show that simulated ‘interoceptive lesions’ blunt fear expectations, induce psychosomatic hallucinations, and exacerbate metacognitive biases.

We conducted genome-wide association analyses of lifetime symptoms of mania, psychosis, irritability in 124,952 to 208,315 individuals from UK Biobank, and then applied Genomic SEM to model the genetic relationships between these psychiatric symptoms and clinically-defined psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder). Two dimensions of cross-cutting genetic liability emerged general vulnerability to self-reported symptoms (pself) versus transdiagnostic vulnerability to clinically-diagnosed disease (pclinician). These were only modestly correlated (rg = .344). Multivariate GWAS identified 145 and 11 independent and genome-wide significant loci for pclinician and pself, respectively, and improved polygenic prediction, relative to univariate GWAS, in hold-out samples. Despite the severe impairments in occupational and educational functioning seen in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pself showed stronger and more pervasive genetic correlations with facets of socioeconomic disadvantage (educational attainment, income, and neighborhood deprivation), whereas pclinician was more strongly associated with medical disorders unrelated to the brain. Genetic variance in pclinician that was unrelated to general vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms was associated with less socioeconomic disadvantage, suggesting positive selection biases in clinical samples used in psychiatric GWAS. These findings inform criticisms of psychiatric nosology by suggesting that cross-disorder genetic liabilities identified in GWASs of clinician-defined psychiatric disease are relatively distinct from genetic liabilities operating on self-reported symptom variation in the general population.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Not just one p Multivariate GWAS of psychiatric disorders and their cardinal symptoms reveal two dimensions of cross-cutting genetic liabilities, bioRxiv, 2019-04-10","uri":"/reports/not_just_one_p_multivariate_gwas_of_psychiatric_disorders_and_their_cardinal_symptoms_reveal_two_dimensions_of_cross-cutting_genetic_liabilities_58795305/"},{"date":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundOne of the challenges of next generation sequencing (NGS) is contaminating reads from other samples. We used the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, a large, diverse, and robustly generated dataset, as a useful resource to understand the factors that contribute to contamination.ResultsWe obtained 11,340 RNA-Seq samples, DNA variant call files (VCF) of 635 individuals, and technical metadata from GTEx as well as read count data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and a pharmacogenetics study. We analyzed 48 tissues in GTEx. Of these, 24 had variant co-expression clusters of four known highly expressed and pancreas-enriched genes (PRSS1, PNLIP, CLPS, and CELA3A). Fifteen additional highly expressed genes from other tissues were also indicative of contamination (KRT4, KRT13, PGC, CPA1, GP2, PRL, LIPF, CTRB2, FGA, HP, CKM, FGG, MYBPC1, MYH2, ZG16B). Sample contamination by non-native genes was highly associated with a sample being sequenced on the same day as a tissue that natively has high levels of those genes. This was highly significant for both pancreas genes (p= 2.7E-75) and esophagus genes (p= 8.9E-154). We used genetic polymorphism differences between individuals as validation of the contamination. Specifically, 11 SNPs in five genes shown to contaminate non-native tissues demonstrated allelic differences between DNA-based genotypes and contaminated sample RNA-based genotypes. Low-level contamination affected 1,841 (15.8%) samples (defined as ≥500 PRSS1 read counts). It also led to eQTL assignments in inappropriate tissues among these 19 genes. In support of this type of contamination occurring widely, pancreas gene contamination (PRSS1) was also observed in the HPA dataset, where pancreas samples were sequenced, but not in the pharmacogenomics dataset, where they were not.ConclusionsHighly expressed, tissue-enriched genes basally contaminate the GTEx dataset impacting on some downstream GTEx data analyses.

Each genomic locus has been overwritten so many times by recombination that it is impossible to reconstruct the clonal phylogeny and, instead of a consensus phylogeny, the phylogeny typically changes many thousands of times along the core genome alignment.We also show how SNP splits can be used to quantify the relative rates with which different subsets of strains have recombined in the past. We find that virtually every strain has a unique pattern of recombination frequencies with other strains and that the relative rates with which different subsets of strains share SNPs follow long-tailed distributions. Our findings show that bacterial populations are neither clonal nor freely recombining, but structured such that recombination rates between different lineages vary along a continuum spanning several orders of magnitude, with a unique pattern of rates for each lineage.

Trio sequencing has been demonstrated to produce a higher diagnostic yield than singleton (proband-only) sequencing. Parental sequencing is especially useful when a disease is suspected to be caused by a de novo variant in the proband, because parental data provide a strong filter for the majority of variants that are shared by the proband and their parents. However the additional cost of sequencing the parents makes the trio strategy uneconomical for many clinical situations. With two thirds of the sequencing budget being spent on parents, these are funds that could be used to sequence more probands. For this reason many clinics are reluctant to sequence parents.Here we propose a pooled-parent strategy for exome sequencing of individuals with likely de novo disease. In this strategy, DNA from all the parents of a cohort of unrelated probands is pooled together into a single exome capture and sequencing run. Variants called in the proband can then be filtered if they are also found in the parent pool, resulting in a shorter list of prioritised variants. To evaluate the pooled-parent strategy we performed a series of simulations by combining reads from individual exomes to imitate sample pooling. We assessed the recall and false positive rate and investigated the trade-off between pool size and recall rate. We compared the performance of GATK HaplotypeCaller individual and joint calling, and FreeBayes to genotype pooled samples.

We integrated genetic and official school transcript data from over 3,000 European-ancestry students from U.S. high schools. We used polygenic scores as a molecular tracer to understand how the flow of students through the high school math pipeline differs in socioeconomically advantaged versus disadvantaged schools. Students with higher education polygenic scores were tracked to more advanced math already at the beginning of high school and persisted in math for more years. Molecular tracer analyses revealed that the dynamics of the math pipeline differed by school advantage. Compared to disadvantaged schools, advantaged schools tracked more students with high polygenic scores into advanced math classes at the start of high school, and they buffered students with low polygenic scores from dropping out of math. Across all schools, even students with exceptional polygenic scores (top 2%) were unlikely to take the most advanced math classes, suggesting substantial room for improvement in the development of potential STEM talent.

Our framework encompasses previous influential theories of neural coding, such as efficient coding and attractor network models, as special cases, given specific choices of reward function.

Having defined the Core Data Resources, we explored characteristics of the usage, impact and sustainability of the set as a whole to assess the value and importance of these resources as an infrastructure, to understand sustainability to the infrastructure, and to demonstrate a model for assessing Core Data Resources worldwide.ResultsThe nineteen resources designated as Core Data Resources by ELIXIR together form a data infrastructure in Europe that is a subset of the wider worldwide open life sciences data infrastructure. These resources are of crucial importance to research throughout the world. We show that, from 2013 to 2017, data managed by the Core Data Resources tripled and usage doubled while staff numbers increased by only a sixth.

This is particularly true in the central nervous system, where large numbers of neurons and oligodendrocytes are eliminated via apoptosis during normal development. Given the profound impact of death upon these two major cell populations, it is surprising that developmental death of another major cell type – the astrocyte – has rarely been studied. It is presently unclear whether astrocytes are subject to significant amounts of developmental death, or how it occurs. Here we address these questions using mouse retinal astrocytes as our model system. We show that the total number of retinal astrocytes declines by over 3-fold during a death period spanning postnatal days 5-14. Surprisingly, these astrocytes do not die by apoptosis, the canonical mechanism underlying the vast majority of developmental cell death. Instead, we find that microglia kill and engulf astrocytes to mediate their developmental removal. Genetic ablation of microglia inhibits astrocyte death, leading to a larger astrocyte population size at the end of the death period. However, astrocyte death is not completely blocked in the absence of microglia, apparently due to the ability of astrocytes to engulf each other. Nevertheless, mice lacking microglia showed significant anatomical changes to the retinal astrocyte network, with functional consequences for the astrocyte-associated vasculature leading to retinal hemorrhage. These results establish a novel modality for naturally-occurring cell death, and demonstrate its importance for formation and integrity of the retinal gliovascular network.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Large-scale death of retinal astrocytes during normal development mediated by microglia, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04","uri":"/reports/large-scale_death_of_retinal_astrocytes_during_normal_development_mediated_by_microglia_58453924/"},{"date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCRISPRCas9 nucleases are powerful genome engineering tools, but unwanted cleavage at off-target and previously edited sites remains a major concern.

Moreover, dRNAs can prevent cleavage of homology-directed repair (HDR)-corrected sites, facilitating “scarless” editing by eliminating the need for blocking mutations. Thus, we enable precise genome editing by establishing a novel and flexible approach for suppressing unwanted editing of both off-targets and HDR-corrected sites.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Suppression of unwanted CRISPRCas9 editing by co-administration of catalytically inactivating truncated guide RNAs, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04","uri":"/reports/suppression_of_unwanted_crisprcas9_editing_by_co-administration_of_catalytically_inactivating_truncated_guide_rnas_58453110/"},{"date":"2019-04-04T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTIn plants, self-fertilization is both an important reproductive strategy and a valuable genetic tool. In theory, selfing increases homozygosity at a rate of 0.50 per generation. Increased homozygosity can uncover recessive deleterious variants and lead to inbreeding depression, unless it is countered by the loss of these variants by genetic purging. Here we investigated the dynamics of purging on genomic scale by testing three predictions. The first was that heterozygous, putatively deleterious SNPs were preferentially lost from the genome during continued selfing. The second was that the loss of deleterious SNPs varied as a function of recombination rate, because recombination increases the efficacy of selection by uncoupling linked variants. Finally, we predicted that genome size (GS) decreases during selfing, due to the purging of deleterious transposable element (TE) insertions. We tested these three predictions by following GS and SNP variants in a series of selfed maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) lines over six generations. In these lines, putatively deleterious alleles were purged, and purging was more pronounced in highly recombining regions. Homozygosity increased more slowly than expected; instead of increasing by 50% each generation, it increased by 35% to 40%. Finally, three lines showed dramatic decreases in GS, losing an average of 398 Mb from their genomes over the short timeframe of our experiment. TEs were the principal component of loss, and GS loss was more likely for lineages that began with more TE and more chromosomal knob repeats. Overall, this study documented remarkable GS loss – as much DNA as three Arabidopsis thaliana genomes, on average - in only a few generations of selfing.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The Genomics of Selfing in Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) Catching Purging in the Act, bioRxiv, 2019-04-04","uri":"/reports/the_genomics_of_selfing_in_maize_zea_mays_ssp._mays_catching_purging_in_the_act_58540859/"},{"date":"2019-04-03T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolyploidy generates diversity by increasing the number of copies of each chromosome.

Previous work has suggested that organisms may also respond to mutations by transcriptional adaptation, a process by which related gene(s) are upregulated independently of protein feedback loops. However, the prevalence of transcriptional adaptation and its underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here, by analysing several models of transcriptional adaptation in zebrafish and mouse, we uncover a requirement for mutant mRNA degradation. Alleles that fail to transcribe the mutated gene do not exhibit transcriptional adaptation, and these alleles give rise to more severe phenotypes than alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay. Transcriptome analysis in alleles displaying mutant mRNA decay reveals the upregulation of a substantial proportion of the genes that exhibit sequence similarity with the mutated gene's mRNA, suggesting a sequence-dependent mechanism.

It is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, leading to poor hydration of mucus and impairment of the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive organ functions. Advancements in medical care have lead to markedly increased longevity of patients with CF, but new complications have emerged, such as early onset of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although the pathogenesis of CRC in CF remains unclear, altered host-microbe interactions might play a critical role. Here, we characterize the changes in the gut microbiome and host gene expression in colonic mucosa of CF patients relative to healthy controls. We find that CF patients show decreased microbial diversity, decreased abundance of taxa such as Butyricimonas, Sutterella, and Ruminococcaceae, and increased abundance of other taxa, such as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. We find that 1543 genes, including CFTR, show differential expression in the colon of CF patients compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, we find that these genes are enriched with functions related to gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, such as metastasis of CRC, tumor suppression, cellular dysfunction, p53 and mTOR signaling pathways. Lastly, we modeled associations between relative abundances of specific bacterial taxa in the gut mucosa and host gene expression, and identified CRC-related genes, including LCN2 and DUOX2, for which gene expression is correlated with the abundance of CRC-associated bacteria, such as Ruminococcaceae and Veillonella.

Here, we uncover the RNA export pathway specific for piRNA precursors in the Drosophila germline. This pathway requires Nxf3-Nxt1, a variant of the hetero-dimeric mRNA export receptor Nxf1-Nxt1. Nxf3 interacts with UAP56, a nuclear RNA helicase essential for mRNA export, and CG13741Bootlegger, which recruits Nxf3-Nxt1 and UAP56 to heterochromatic piRNA source loci. Upon RNA cargo binding, Nxf3 achieves nuclear export via the exportin Crm1, and accumulates together with Bootlegger in peri-nuclear nuage, suggesting that after export, Nxf3-Bootlegger delivers precursor transcripts to the piRNA processing sites.

In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier. Our data suggest we need to widen the discussion regarding diversity and equality in science to incorporate potential barriers to career success in addition to gender.AbstractThe academic disciplines of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have long suffered from a lack of diversity. While in recent years there has been some progress in addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM subjects, other protected characteristics have received less attention. In this study, we survey early career scientists in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, behaviour, and related disciplines. We (i) quantitatively examine the effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition, and (ii) provide practical suggestions, based on the qualitative responses of those surveyed, for overcoming some of the barriers we identified. We found that socioeconomic background and ethnicity impacted negatively on the quantitative measures of career progression we examined. Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression. This may reflect the fact that these characteristics have received less attention, and are therefore deemed more sensitive.

Thirty-one previously resistance-trained, college-aged males (mean ± standard deviation 21±2 years, 5±3 training years) had vastus lateralis (VL) muscle biopsies obtained prior to training (PRE), at week 3 (W3), and at week 6 (W6). Muscle tissue from 15 subjects exhibiting PRE to W6 VL mean fCSA increases ranging from 320-1600 μm2 was further interrogated using various biochemical and histological assays as well as proteomic analysis. Seven of these individuals donated a VL biopsy after refraining from training 8 days following the last training session (W7) to determine how deloading affected biomarkers. The 15 fCSA hypertrophic responders experienced a +23% increase in mean fCSA from PRE to W6 (p\u0026lt;0.001) and, while muscle glycogen concentrations remained unaltered, citrate synthase activity levels decreased by 24% (p\u0026lt;0.001) suggesting mitochondrial volume decreased. Interestingly, both myosin and actin concentrations decreased ~30% from PRE to W6 (p\u0026lt;0.05). Phalloidin-actin staining similarly revealed actin concentrations per fiber decreased from PRE to W6. Proteomic analysis of the sarcoplasmic fraction from PRE to W6 indicated 40 proteins were up-regulated (p\u0026lt;0.05), KEGG analysis indicated that the glycolysisgluconeogenesis pathway was upregulated (FDR sig. \u0026lt;0.001), and DAVID indicated that the following functionally-annotated pathways were upregulated (FDR value \u0026lt;0.05) a) glycolysis (8 proteins), b) acetylation (23 proteins), c) gluconeogenesis (5 proteins) and d) cytoplasm (20 proteins).

These data suggest that short-term high-volume resistance training may a) reduce muscle fiber actin and myosin protein concentrations in spite of increasing fCSA, and b) promote sarcoplasmic expansion coincident with a coordinated up-regulation of sarcoplasmic proteins involved in glycolysis and other metabolic processes related to ATP generation.

Here we address this question for TDP-43 by systematically mutating14 the protein and quantifying the effects on cellular toxicity. We generated \u0026gt;50,000 mutations in the intrinsically disordered prion-like domain (PRD) and observed that changes in hydrophobicity and aggregation potential are highly predictive of changes in toxicity. Surprisingly, however, increased hydrophobicity and cytoplasmic aggregation actually reduce cellular toxicity. Mutations have their strongest effects in a central region of the PRD, with variants that increase toxicity promoting the formation of more dynamic liquid-like condensates. The genetic interactions in double mutants reveal that specific structures exist in this ‘unstructured’ region in vivo. Our results demonstrate that deep mutagenesis is a powerful approach for probing the sequence-function relationships of intrinsically disordered proteins as well as their in vivo structural conformations.

The method treats the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) as a latent variable that is integrated out using previously published Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The method can be used for detecting selection, estimating selection coefficients, testing models of changes in the strength of selection, estimating the time of the start of a selective sweep, and for inferring the allele frequency trajectory of a selected or neutral allele. We perform extensive simulations to evaluate the method and show that it uniformly improves power to detect selection compared to current popular methods such as nSL and SDS, under various demographic models and can provide reliable inferences of allele frequency trajectories under many conditions.

At a more local scale, SNPs within genes (∼51%) captured ∼1.5-times more genetic variance than the rest; and SNPs with low minor allele frequency (MAF) captured significantly less variance than those with higher MAF the 40% of SNPs with MAF\u0026lt;5% captured less than one fourth of the genetic variance. We also observed extensive pleiotropy across regions, with an average genetic correlation of rG∼0.45. Across regions, genetic correlations were in general similar to phenotypic correlations. By contrast, genetic correlations were larger than phenotypic correlations for the leftright volumes of the same region, and indistinguishable from 1. Additionally, the differences in leftright volumes were not heritable, underlining the role of environmental causes in the variability of brain asymmetry.

However, a comprehensive analysis of their data reveals a number of issues that must be carefully addressed before challenging the current paradigm. Unfortunately, the methods section lacks any description of sample management, validation of their results in independent laboratories was deficient, and the reported findings have been observed at a frequency at complete variance with established evidence. Moreover, the remarkably high (and unusually homogeneous) levels of heteroplasmy reported can be readily detected using classical techniques for DNA sequencing. By reassessing the raw sequencing data with an alternative computational pipeline, we report strong correlation to the NextGENe results provided by the authors on a per sample base. However, the sequencing replicates from the same donors show aberrations in the variants detected that need further investigation to exclude contributions from other sources or methodological artifacts. Finally, applying the principle of reductio ad absurdum, we demonstrate that the nuclear factor invoked by the authors would need to be extraordinarily complex and precise in order to preclude linear accumulation of mtDNA lineages across generations.

Measurement of Flt3L by ELISA reveals that Flt3+AML, is associated with depletion of Flt3L to undetectable levels. After induction chemotherapy, Flt3L is restored in patients entering CR, but remains depressed in those with refractory disease. Weekly sampling reveals marked differences in the kinetics of Flt3L response during the first 6 weeks of treatment, proportionate to the clearance of blasts and cellularity of the BM. In the UK NCRI AML17 trial, Flt3L was measured at day 26 in a subgroup of 135 patients with Flt3 mutation randomized to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lestaurtinib. In these patients, attainment of CR was associated with higher Flt3L at day 26 (Mann-Whitney p \u0026lt; 0.0001). Day 26 Flt3L was also associated with survival Flt3L ≤ 291pgml was associated with inferior event-free survival; and, Flt3L \u0026gt;1185pgml was associated with higher overall survival (p = 0.0119). Serial measurement of Flt3L in patients who had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for AML further illustrated the potential value of declining Flt3L to identify relapse.

SCREAM directly binds with MPK36 through an evolutionarily-conserved yet unconventional bipartite motif. Mutations in this motif abrogate association, phosphorylation and degradation of SCREAM, unmask hidden non-redundancies between MPK3 and MPK6, and result in uncontrolled stomatal differentiation. Structural analyses of MPK6 at the 2.75Å resolution unraveled bipartite binding of SCREAM with MPK6, that is distinct from an upstream MAPKK.

We developed and used a portable IAV sequencing and analysis platform called Mia (Mobile Influenza Analysis) to complete and characterize full-length consensus genomes approximately 18 hours after unpacking the mobile lab. Swine are important animal IAV reservoirs that have given rise to pandemic viruses via zoonotic transmission. Genomic analyses of IAV in swine are critical to understanding pandemic risk of viruses in this reservoir, and characterization of viruses circulating in exhibition swine enables rapid comparison to current seasonal influenza vaccines and CVVs.

We recorded electrocardiography (ECG) in 26 subjects who formed 13 dyads containing an action executioner and observer as they performed a self-paced sequence of movements.

Diverse organisms employ structural color to mediate ecological interactions and create specific optical effects such as iridescence. Despite its importance for living systems, the developmental, genetic, and evolutionary processes that generate structural color largely remain mysterious. Here, we focus on simple photonic structures, thin film reflectors, in the lower lamina of Junonia butterfly scales. We present multiple lines of evidence that the thickness of the lamina quantitatively controls lamina color, which is an important determinant of overall wing color, even when pigments are also present. First, in a lineage of buckeye butterflies artificially selected for blue wing color for 12 generations, a thicker lamina resulted in a color shift from brown to blue. A similar lamina thickness increase explains the appearance of blue scales in butterflies with mutations in the optix wing patterning gene. Finally, lamina thickness variation underlies the color diversity that distinguishes seasonal variants, sexes, and species throughout the genus Junonia. Thus, quantitatively tuning a single dimension of the existing scale architecture allows butterflies to evolve a broad spectrum of hues over both microevolutionary and macroevolutionary time frames. Because the lower lamina is an intrinsic component of typical butterfly scales, our findings imply that lamina structural color influences wing color in most butterflies.Significance StatementStructural colors, which result from photonic nanostructures that refract light and can create iridescence, are an important tool for many organisms. We use thin films, which are morphologically simple nanostructures that generate structural color in the lower lamina of butterfly scales, to dissect how photonic structures evolve.

However, the spread of these ancestries into the western Mediterranean where they have contributed to many populations living today remains poorly understood. We generated genome-wide ancient DNA from the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Sardinia, increasing the number of individuals with reported data from these islands from 3 to 52. We obtained data from the oldest skeleton excavated from the Balearic islands (dating to ∼2400 BCE), and show that this individual had substantial Steppe pastoralist-derived ancestry; however, later Balearic individuals had less Steppe heritage reflecting geographic heterogeneity or immigration from groups with more European first farmer-related ancestry. In Sicily, Steppe pastoralist ancestry arrived by ∼2200 BCE and likely came at least in part from Spain as it was associated with Iberian-specific Y chromosomes. In Sicily, Iranian-related ancestry also arrived by the Middle Bronze Age, thus revealing that this ancestry type, which was ubiquitous in the Aegean by this time, also spread further west prior to the classical period of Greek expansion. In Sardinia, we find no evidence of either eastern ancestry type in the Nuragic Bronze Age, but show that Iranian-related ancestry arrived by at least ∼300 BCE and Steppe ancestry arrived by ∼300 CE, joined at that time or later by North African ancestry. These results falsify the view that the people of Sardinia are isolated descendants of Europe’s first farmers. Instead, our results show that the island’s admixture history since the Bronze Age is as complex as that in many other parts of Europe.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"The Arrival of Steppe and Iranian Related Ancestry in the Islands of the Western Mediterranean, bioRxiv, 2019-03-21","uri":"/reports/the_arrival_of_steppe_and_iranian_related_ancestry_in_the_islands_of_the_western_mediterranean_57426734/"},{"date":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTOver the last decade, artificial neural networks (ANNs), have undergone a revolution, catalyzed in large part by better tools for supervised learning. However, training such networks requires enormous data sets of labeled examples, whereas young animals (including humans) typically learn with few or no labeled examples. This stark contrast with biological learning has led many in the ANN community posit that instead of supervised paradigms, animals must rely instead primarily on unsupervised learning, leading the search for better unsupervised algorithms. Here we argue that much of an animal’s behavioral repertoire is not the result of clever learning algorithms—supervised or unsupervised—but arises instead from behavior programs already present at birth. These programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly. Recognizing the importance of the highly structured connectivity suggests a path toward building ANNs capable of rapid learning.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"A Critique of Pure Learning What Artificial Neural Networks can Learn from Animal Brains, bioRxiv, 2019-03-20","uri":"/reports/a_critique_of_pure_learning_what_artificial_neural_networks_can_learn_from_animal_brains_57333723/"},{"date":"2019-03-20T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe recent rapid spread of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods has created a large variety of experimental and computational pipelines for which best practices have not been established yet.

We first find that a composite of structural image quality relates to important developmental and behavioral variables (e.g., IQ; clinical diagnoses). Additionally, we demonstrate that even among T1-weighted images which pass visual inspection, variations in image quality impact volumetric derivations of regional gray matter. Image quality was associated with wide-spread variations in gray matter, including in portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the cerebellum. Further, our image quality composite partially mediated the relationship between age and total gray matter volume, explaining 23% of this relationship.

The two TF classes also had distinct chromatin-binding preferences and auto-regulatory properties. The regulatory range of a single TF bound within different topologically associating domains (TADs) depended on intrinsic TAD properties such as local gene density and GC content, but also on the TAD chromatin state in specific cell types. Our results provide evidence that most TFs belong to one of these two functional classes, and that the regulatory range of long-range TFs is chromatin-state dependent.

As national biobanks, human disease association studies, and clinical genetic testing are increasingly reliant on whole-genome sequencing, population references for small variants (i.e., SNVs \u0026amp; indels) in protein-coding genes, such as the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), have become integral for the evaluation and interpretation of genomic variation. However, no comparable large-scale reference maps for SVs exist to date. Here, we constructed a reference atlas of SVs from deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 14,891 individuals across diverse global populations (54% non-European) as a component of gnomAD. We discovered a rich landscape of 498,257 unique SVs, including 5,729 multi-breakpoint complex SVs across 13 mutational subclasses, and examples of localized chromosome shattering, like chromothripsis, in the general population. The mutation rates and densities of SVs were non-uniform across chromosomes and SV classes. We discovered strong correlations between constraint against predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) SNVs and rare SVs that both disrupt and duplicate protein-coding genes, suggesting that existing per-gene metrics of pLoF SNV constraint do not simply reflect haploinsufficiency, but appear to capture a gene’s general sensitivity to dosage alterations. The average genome in gnomAD-SV harbored 8,202 SVs, and approximately eight genes altered by rare SVs. When incorporating these data with pLoF SNVs, we estimate that SVs comprise at least 25% of all rare pLoF events per genome. We observed large (≥1Mb), rare SVs in 3.1% of genomes (∼132 individuals), and a clinically reportable pathogenic incidental finding from SVs in 0.24% of genomes (∼1417 individuals). We also estimated the prevalence of previously reported pathogenic recurrent CNVs associated with genomic disorders, which highlighted differences in frequencies across populations and confirmed that WGS-based analyses can readily recapitulate these clinically important variants.

Non-additive interactions between mutations occur extensively and change across conditions, cell types, and species, making genetic prediction a difficult challenge. To understand the reasons for this, we reduced the problem to a minimal system where we combined mutations in a single protein performing a single function (a transcriptional repressor inhibiting a target gene). Even in this minimal system, a change in gene expression altered both the strength and type of genetic interactions. These seemingly complicated changes could, however, be predicted by a mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype. We show that similar changes will be observed for many genes. These results provide fundamental insights into genotype-phenotype maps and illustrate how changes in genetic interactions can be predicted using hierarchical mechanistic models.One sentence SummaryDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor reveals that changes in gene expression will alter the strength and direction of genetic interactions between mutations in many genes.Highlights\u003cjatslist list-type=bullet\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eDeep mutagenesis of the lambda repressor at two expression levels reveals extensive changes in mutational effects and genetic interactions\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eGenetic interactions can switch from positive (suppressive) to negative (enhancing) as the expression of a gene changes\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eA mathematical model that propagates the effects of mutations on protein folding to the cellular phenotype accurately predicts changes in mutational effects and interactions\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eChanges in expression will alter mutational effects and interactions for many genes\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eFor some genes, perfect mechanistic models will never be able to predict how mutations of known effect combine without measurements of intermediate phenotypes\u003cjatslist-item\u003e","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Changes in gene expression shift and switch genetic interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-03-15","uri":"/reports/changes_in_gene_expression_shift_and_switch_genetic_interactions_57026134/"},{"date":"2019-03-15T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractTo extend the frontier of genome editing and enable the radical redesign of mammalian genomes, we developed a set of dead-Cas9 base editor (dBE) variants that allow editing at tens of thousands of loci per cell by overcoming the cell death associated with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs).

One approach to this problem is to separate the requirements of the insertion device, which should to be as stiff as possible, with the implanted device, which should be as small and flexible as possible. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach with a system incorporating fine and flexible thin-film polymer probes, a fine and stiff insertion needle, and a robotic insertion machine. Together the system permits rapid and precise implantation of probes, each individually targeted to avoid observable vasculature and to attain diverse anatomical targets. As an initial demonstration of this system, we implanted arrays of electrodes in rat somatosensory cortex, recorded extracellular action potentials from them, and obtained histological images of the tissue response.

The genomes of these species are densely-packed with functional elements, leaving little room for the co-option of genomic sequences into new transcribed loci. Despite this, we find that at least 213 transcripts (~5%) have arisen de novo in the past 20 million years of evolution of baker’s yeast-or approximately 10 new transcripts every million years. Nearly half of the total newly expressed sequences are generated from regions in which both DNA strands are used as templates for transcription, explaining the apparent contradiction between the limited ‘empty’ genomic space and high rate of de novo gene birth. In addition, we find that 40% of these de novo transcripts are actively translated and that at least a fraction of the encoded proteins are likely to be under purifying selection.

We estimate three widely applied metrics for describing species distributions encounter rate, occupancy probability, and relative abundance. For each method, we outline approaches for data processing and modelling that are suitable for using citizen science data for estimating species distributions.Model performance improved when data processing and analytical methods addressed the challenges arising from citizen science data. The largest gains in model performance were achieved with two key processes 1) the use of complete checklists rather than presence-only data, and 2) the use of covariates describing variation in effort and detectability for each checklist. Including these covariates accounted for heterogeneity in detectability and reporting, and resulted in substantial differences in predicted distributions. The data processing and analytical steps we outlined led to improved model performance across a range of sample sizes.When using citizen science data it is imperative to carefully consider the appropriate data processing and analytical procedures required to address the bias and variation. Here, we describe the consequences and utility of applying our suggested approach to semi-structured citizen science data to estimate species distributions.

Using Mendelian Randomization, we identified cognitive ability as one of the causal, partly-heritable phenotypes that bridges the gap between molecular genetic inheritance and phenotypic consequence in terms of income differences. Significant differences between genetic correlations indicated that, the genetic variants associated with income are related to better mental health than those linked to educational attainment (another commonly-used marker of SEP).

The increased susceptibility of land plants is largely thought to be due to their dependence on micro-organisms for nutrients; the ensuing co-evolution has shaped the plant immune system. By profiling the immune receptors across flowering plants, we identified species with low numbers of NLR immune receptors. Interestingly, four of these species represent distinct lineages of monocots and dicots that returned to the aquatic lifestyle. Both aquatic monocot and dicot species lost the same well-known downstream immune signalling complex (EDS1-PAD4). This observation inspired us to look for other genes with a similar loss pattern and allowed us to predict putative new components of plant immunity. Gene expression analyses confirmed that a group of these genes was differentially expressed under pathogen infection. Excitingly, another subset of these genes was differentially expressed upon drought. Collectively, our study reveals the minimal plant immune system required for life under water, and highlights additional components required for the life of land plants.Author summaryPlant resistance to pathogens is commonly mediated by a complex gene family, known as NLRs. Upon pathogen infection, changes in the cellular environment trigger NLR activation and subsequent defence responses. Despite the dependence of agricultural practices on NLR genes to control pathogen load, relatively little is known about this gene family outside of model crop species. In this study, we identified a convergent reduction in the NLR gene family among two lineages of aquatic plants. Furthermore, we established that NLR reduction occurred in conjunction with the loss of a common immune signalling pathway. Subsequently, we identified other genes convergently lost in aquatic species and propose these as candidate components of the plant immune signalling pathway. In addition, we revealed components of the agronomically important drought response to be lost in aquatic plants. This study adds to our understanding of the complex interactions between environment and response to biotic stress, widely known as the disease triangle.

Here, we systematically survey MNVs in 125,748 whole exomes and 15,708 whole genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identify 1,996,125 MNVs across the genome with constituent variants falling within 2 bp distance of one another, of which 31,510 exist within the same codon, including 405 predicted to result in gain of a nonsense mutation, 1,818 predicted to rescue a nonsense mutation event that would otherwise be caused by one of the constituent variants, and 16,481 additional variants predicted to alter protein sequences. We show that the distribution of MNVs is highly non-uniform across the genome, and that this non-uniformity can be largely explained by a variety of known mutational mechanisms, such as CpG deamination, replication error by polymerase zeta, or polymerase slippage at repeat junctions. We also provide an estimate of the dinucleotide mutation rate caused by polymerase zeta. Finally, we show that differential CpG methylation drives MNV differences across functional categories. Our results demonstrate the importance of incorporating haplotype-aware annotation for accurate functional interpretation of genetic variation, and refine our understanding of genome-wide mutational mechanisms of MNVs.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Landscape of multi-nucleotide variants in 125,748 human exomes and 15,708 genomes, bioRxiv, 2019-03-11","uri":"/reports/landscape_of_multi-nucleotide_variants_in_125748_human_exomes_and_15708_genomes_56814890/"},{"date":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryIntermediary metabolism in cancer cells is regulated by diverse cell-autonomous processes including signal transduction and gene expression patterns arising from specific oncogenotypes and cell lineages.

Because extended exposure to visible light can be toxic to cells, it is important to characterize the effects of light stimulation on cellular function in the absence of exogenous optogenetic proteins. Here we exposed cultured mouse cortical neurons that did not express optogenetic proteins to several hours of flashing blue, red, or green light. We found that exposing neurons to as short as one hour of blue, but not red or green, light results in the induction of neuronal-activity-regulated genes without inducing neuronal activity. Our findings suggest blue light stimulation is ill-suited to long-term optogenetic experiments, especially those that measure transcription.Significance StatementOptogenetics is widely used to control cellular functions using light. In neuroscience, channelrhodopsins, exogenous light-sensitive channels, are used to achieve light-dependent control of neuronal firing. This optogenetic control of neuronal firing requires exposing neurons to high-powered light. We ask how this light exposure, in the absence of channelrhodopsin, affects the expression of neuronal-activity-regulated genes, i.e., the genes that are transcribed in response to neuronal stimuli. Surprisingly, we find that neurons without channelrhodopsin express neuronal-activity-regulated genes in response to as short as an hour of blue, but not red or green, light exposure. These findings suggest that experimenters wishing to achieve longer-term (an hour or more) optogenetic control over neuronal firing should avoid using systems that require blue light.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Blue light induces neuronal-activity-regulated gene expression in the absence of optogenetic proteins, bioRxiv, 2019-03-09","uri":"/reports/blue_light_induces_neuronal-activity-regulated_gene_expression_in_the_absence_of_optogenetic_proteins_56756504/"},{"date":"2019-03-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Assessing the health and competence of the immune system is central to evaluating vaccination responses, autoimmune conditions, cancer prognosis and treatment.

Cannabinoids such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) directly activate cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), however, it is not known if terpenoids present in Cannabis also affect cannabinoid receptor signalling. Therefore, we examined 6 common terpenoids alone, and in combination with cannabinoid receptor agonists, on CB1 and CB2 signalling in vitro.Materials and MethodsPotassium channel activity in AtT20 FlpIn cells transfected with human CB1 or CB2 receptors was measured in real-time using FLIPR® membrane potential dye in a FlexStation 3 plate reader. Terpenoids were tested individually and in combination for periods up to 30 minutes. Endogenous somatostatin receptors served as a control for direct effects of drugs on potassium channels.Resultsα-Pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene, linalool, limonene and β-myrcene (up to 30-100 µM) did not change membrane potential in AtT20 cells expressing CB1 or CB2, or affect the response to a maximally effective concentration of the synthetic cannabinoid CP55,940. The presence of individual or a combination of terpenoids did not affect the hyperpolarization produced by Δ9-THC (10µM) (CB1 control, 59±7%; with terpenoids (10 µM each) 55±4%; CB2 Δ9-THC 16±5%, with terpenoids (10 µM each) 17±4%). To investigate possible effect on desensitization of CB1 responses, all six terpenoids were added together with Δ9-THC and signalling measured continuously over 30 min. Terpenoids did not affect desensitization, after 30 minutes the control hyperpolarization recovered by 63±6%, in the presence of the terpenoids recovery was 61±5%.DiscussionNone of the six of the most common terpenoids in Cannabis directly activated CB1 or CB2, or modulated the signalling of the phytocannabinoid agonist Δ9-THC. These results suggest that if a phytocannabinoid-terpenoid entourage effect exists, it is not at the CB1 or CB2 receptor level. It remains possible that terpenoids activate CB1 and CB2 signalling pathways that do not involve potassium channels, however, it seems more likely that they may act at different molecular target(s) in the neuronal circuits important for the behavioural effect of Cannabis.","tags":["biorxiv","pharmacology-and-toxicology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Absence of entourage Terpenoids commonly found in Cannabis sativa do not modulate the functional activity of Δ9-THC at human CB1and CB2 receptors, bioRxiv, 2019-03-06","uri":"/reports/absence_of_entourage_terpenoids_commonly_found_in_cannabis_sativa_do_not_modulate_the_functional_activity_of_%CE%B49-thc_at_human_cb1and_cb2_receptors_56582898/"},{"date":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundWhole-genome “shotgun” (WGS) metagenomic sequencing is an increasingly widely used tool for analyzing the metagenomic content of microbiome samples. While WGS data contains gene-level information, it can be challenging to analyze the millions of microbial genes which are typically found in microbiome experiments. To mitigate the ultrahigh dimensionality challenge of gene-level metagenomics, it has been proposed to cluster genes by co-abundance to form Co-Abundant Gene groups (CAGs). However, exhaustive co-abundance clustering of millions of microbial genes across thousands of biological samples has previously been intractable purely due to the computational challenge of performing trillions of pairwise comparisons.ResultsHere we present a novel computational approach to the analysis of WGS datasets in which microbial gene groups are the fundamental unit of analysis. We use the Approximate Nearest Neighbor heuristic for near-exhaustive average linkage clustering to group millions of genes by co-abundance. This results in thousands of high-quality CAGs representing complete and partial microbial genomes. We applied this method to publicly available WGS microbiome surveys and found that the resulting microbial CAGs associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) were highly reproducible and could be validated independently using multiple independent cohorts.ConclusionsThis powerful approach to gene-level metagenomics provides a powerful path forward for identifying the biological links between the microbiome and human health.

The second symbiont belongs to the Margulisbacteria, a phylum without cultured representatives and not known to form intracellular associations.

Despite recognition that the genome partitions into ~1Mb-sized topological associated domains (TADs) based on ensemble Hi-C measurements, many features of the physical organisation at the single cell level remain underexplored. Using 3D super-resolution microscopy, we reveal a sequential curvilinear arrangement of globular chromatin domains with viscoelastic properties (‘blobs’) juxtaposed to an RNA-populated interchromatin (IC) network. Quantitative mapping of genome function markers uncovers a zonal distribution, with RNA-binding factors concentrated in the IC, confinement of structural proteins and transcriptionally activepermissive marks to chromatin domain surfaces, and enrichment of repressive marks towards the interior. This correlation between nanoscale topology and genome function is relaxed in postreplicative chromatin, accentuated in replicative senescence, persists upon ATP depletion and hyperosmolarity induced chromatin condensation and, remarkably, after inactivation of cohesin. Our findings support a model of a higher-order chromatin architecture on the size level of TADs that creates and modulates distinct functional environments through a combination of biophysical parameters such as density and ATP-driven processes such as replication and transcription, but independent of cohesin.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Chromatin arranges in filaments of blobs with nanoscale functional zonation, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"/reports/chromatin_arranges_in_filaments_of_blobs_with_nanoscale_functional_zonation_56456514/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe genome is organized in megabase-sized three-dimensional units, called Topologically Associated Domains (TADs), that are separated by boundaries. TADs bring distant cis-regulatory elements into proximity, a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA binding factor CTCF. Surprisingly, genome-wide depletion of CTCF has little effect on transcription, yet structural variations affecting TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and congenital disease. Here, we investigate TAD function in vivo in mice by systematically editing components of TAD organization at the Sox9Kcnj locus. We find that TADs are formed by a redundant system of CTCF sites requiring the removal of all major sites within the TAD and at the boundary for two neighboring TADs to fuse. TAD fusion resulted in leakage of regulatory activity from the Sox9 to the Kcnj TAD, but no major changes in gene expression. This indicates that TAD structures provide robustness and precision, but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. Gene misexpression and resulting disease phenotypes, however, were attained by re-directing regulatory activity through inversions andor the re-positioning of boundaries. Thus, efficient re-wiring of enhancer promoter interaction and aberrant disease causing gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation but requires the re-direction of contacts.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Functional dissection of TADs reveals non-essential and instructive roles in regulating gene expression, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"/reports/functional_dissection_of_tads_reveals_non-essential_and_instructive_roles_in_regulating_gene_expression_56502379/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPseudoplanktonic crinoid megaraft colonies are an enigma of the Jurassic. They are among the largest in-situ invertebrate accumulations ever to exist in the Phanerozoic fossil record. These megaraft colonies and are thought to have developed as floating filter-feeding communities due to an exceptionally rich relatively predator free oceanic niche, high in the water column enabling them to reach high densities on these log rafts. However, this pseudoplanktonic hypothesis has never actually been quantitatively tested and some researchers have cast doubt that this mode of life was even possible. The ecological structure of the crinoid colony is resolved using spatial point process techniques and its longevity using moisture diffusion models. Using spatial analysis we found that the crinoids would have trailed preferentially positioned at the back of migrating structures in the regions of least resistance, consistent with a floating, not benthic ecology. Additionally, we found using a series of moisture diffusion models at different log densities and sizes that ecosystem collapse did not take place solely due to colonies becoming overladen as previously assumed. We have found that these crinoid colonies studied could have existed for greater than 10 years, even up to 20 years exceeding the life expectancy of modern documented megaraft systems with implications for the role of modern raft communities in the biotic colonisation of oceanic islands and intercontinental dispersal of marine and terrestrial species.Significance statementTransoceanic rafting is the principle mechanism for the biotic colonisation of oceanic island ecosystems. However, no historic records exist of how long such biotic systems lasted. Here, we use a deep-time example from the Early Jurassic to test the viability of these pseudoplanktonic systems, resolving for the first time whether these systems were truly free floating planktonic and viable for long enough to allow its inhabitants to grow to maturity. Using spatial methods we show that these colonies have a comparable structure to modern marine pesudoplankton on maritime structures, whilst the application of methods normally used in commercial logging is used to demonstrate the viability of the system which was capable of lasting up to 20 years.","tags":["biorxiv","paleontology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Reconstructing the ecology of a Jurassic pseudoplanktonic megaraft colony, bioRxiv, 2019-03-05","uri":"/reports/reconstructing_the_ecology_of_a_jurassic_pseudoplanktonic_megaraft_colony_56514437/"},{"date":"2019-03-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIntegrative analysis of multi-omics data is a powerful approach for gaining functional insights into biological and medical processes.

However, evolving resistance to one drug may come at a cost of decreased growth rate or increased sensitivity to another drug due to evolutionary trade-offs. This weakness can be exploited in the clinic using an approach called ‘evolutionary herding’ that aims at controlling the tumour cell population to delay or prevent resistance. However, recapitulating cancer evolutionary dynamics experimentally remains challenging. Here we present a novel approach for evolutionary herding based on a combination of single-cell barcoding, very large populations of 108–109 cells grown without re-plating, longitudinal non-destructive monitoring of cancer clones, and mathematical modelling of tumour evolution. We demonstrate evolutionary herding in non-small cell lung cancer, showing that herding allows shifting the clonal composition of a tumour in our favour, leading to collateral drug sensitivity and proliferative fitness costs. Through genomic analysis and single-cell sequencing, we were also able to determine the mechanisms that drive such evolved sensitivity.

However, it is unclear if different types of depolarizing signals can be transformed by an ITF into distinct modes of genomic regulation. Here, we show that APs and EPSPs in the murine hippocampus trigger two spatially segregated and molecularly distinct mechanisms that lead to the expression of the ITF NPAS4. These two pathways culminate in the assembly of unique, stimulus-specific NPAS4 heterodimers that exhibit distinctive DNA binding patterns.

Current normalization methods assume most features are not changing, which can lead to misleading conclusions when there are large shifts. However, there are few real datasets and no simulation protocols currently available that can directly benchmark methods when such large shifts occur.We present absSimSeq, an R package that simulates compositional data in the form of RNA-Seq reads. We tested several tools used for RNA-Seq differential analysis sleuth, DESeq2, edgeR, limma, sleuth and ALDEx2 (which explicitly takes a compositional approach). For these tools, we compared their standard normalization to either “compositional normalization”, which uses log-ratios to anchor the data on a set of negative control features, or RUVSeq, another tool that directly uses negative control features.We show that common normalizations result in reduced performance with current methods when there is a large change in the total RNA per cell. Performance improves when spike-ins are included and used by a compositional approach, even if the spike-ins have substantial variation. In contrast, RUVSeq, which normalizes count data rather than compositional data, has poor performance. Further, we show that previous criticisms of spike-ins did not take into account the compositional nature of the data. We conclude that absSimSeq can generate more representative datasets for testing performance, and that spike-ins should be more broadly used in a compositional manner to minimize misleading conclusions from differential analyses.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Compositional Data Analysis is necessary for simulating and analyzing RNA-Seq data, bioRxiv, 2019-03-02","uri":"/reports/compositional_data_analysis_is_necessary_for_simulating_and_analyzing_rna-seq_data_56315555/"},{"date":"2019-03-02T00:00:00Z","description":"Background Proprotein convertase subtilisinkexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition reduces plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)].

Our objectives were to determine the association between variants in PCSK9 and lipoprotein-lipid levels, coronary artery disease (CAD) and CAVS, and to evaluate if PCSK9 could be implicated in aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) calcification.Methods We built a genetic risk score weight for LDL-C levels (wGRS) using 10 independent PCSK9 single nucleotide polymorphisms and determined its association with lipoprotein-lipid levels in 9692 participants of the EPIC-Norfolk study. We investigated the association between the wGRS and CAD and CAVS in the UK Biobank, as well as the association between the PCSK9 R46L variant and CAVS in a meta-analysis of published prospective, population-based studies (Copenhagen studies, 1463 cases101,620 controls) and unpublished studies (UK Biobank, 1350 cases349,043 controls, Malmo Diet and Cancer study, 682 cases5963 controls and EPIC-Norfolk study, 508 cases20,421 controls). We evaluated PCSK9 expression and localization in explanted aortic valves by capillary Western blot and immunohistochemistry in patients with and without CAVS. Von Kossa staining was used to visualize aortic leaflet calcium deposits. PCSK9 expression under oxidative stress conditions in VICs was assessed.Results The wGRS was significantly associated with lower LDL-C and apoB (p\u0026lt;0.001), but not with Lp(a). In the UK Biobank, the association of PCSK9 variants with CAD were positively correlated with their effects on apoB levels.

In vertebrates, double-strand breaks are repaired predominantly by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which directly ligates DNA ends. NHEJ has the potential to be highly mutagenic because it employs DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other enzymes that modify incompatible DNA ends to allow their ligation. Using a biochemical system that recapitulates key features of cellular NHEJ, we show that end-processing requires formation of a “short-range synaptic complex” in which DNA ends are closely aligned in a ligation-competent state. Furthermore, single-molecule imaging directly demonstrates that processing occurs within the short-range complex. This confinement of end processing to a ligation-competent complex ensures that DNA ends undergo ligation as soon as they become compatible, thereby minimizing mutagenesis.

Results Overall, we identified 100,025 gene-trait associations based on conventional genome-wide corrections (P \u0026lt; 5 x 10-08) that also provided evidence of genetic colocalization.

More than 85% of the sequence of the maize genome can be ascribed to past transposition, providing a major contribution to the structure of the genome. Evidence from individual loci has informed our understanding of how transposition has shaped the genome, and a number of individual TE insertions have been causally linked to dramatic phenotypic changes. But genome-wide analyses in maize and other taxa have frequently represented TEs as a relatively homogeneous class of fragmentary relics of past transposition, obscuring their evolutionary history and interaction with their host genome. Using an updated annotation of structurally intact TEs in the maize reference genome, we investigate the family-level ecological and evolutionary dynamics of TEs in maize. Integrating a variety of data, from descriptors of individual TEs like coding capacity, expression, and methylation, as well as similar features of the sequence they inserted into, we model the relationship between these attributes of the genomic environment and the survival of TE copies and families. Our analyses reveal a diversity of ecological strategies of TE families, each representing the evolution of a distinct ecological niche allowing survival of the TE family. In contrast to the wholesale relegation of all TEs to a single category of junk DNA, these differences generate a rich ecology of the genome, suggesting families of TEs that coexist in time and space compete and cooperate with each other. We conclude that while the impact of transposition is highly family- and context-dependent, a family-level understanding of the ecology of TEs in the genome can refine our ability to predict the role of TEs in generating genetic and phenotypic diversity.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The Genomic Ecosystem of Transposable Elements in Maize, bioRxiv, 2019-03-01","uri":"/reports/the_genomic_ecosystem_of_transposable_elements_in_maize_56197313/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"Background The gut microbiome is an important determinant of human health.

We generated 16S ribosomal RNA profiles from stool samples for 858 participants. We investigated genetic and non-genetic factors that contribute to individual differences in fecal microbiome composition.Results Among 110 demographic, clinical and environmental factors, 11 were identified as significantly correlated with α-diversity, β-diversity or abundance of specific microbial communities in multivariable models. Age and blood alanine aminotransferase levels showed the strongest associations with microbiome diversity. In total, all non-genetic factors explained 16.4% of the variance. We then searched for associations between \u0026gt;5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and the same indicators of fecal microbiome diversity, including the significant non-genetic factors as covariates. No genome-wide significant associations were identified after correction for multiple testing. A small fraction of previously reported associations between human genetic variants and specific taxa could be replicated in our cohort, while no replication was observed for any of the diversity metrics.Conclusion In a well-characterized cohort of healthy individuals, we identified several non-genetic variables associated with fecal microbiome diversity. In contrast, host genetics only had a negligible influence. Demographic and environmental factors are thus the main contributors to fecal microbiome composition in healthy individuals.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"A Comprehensive Assessment of Demographic, Environmental and Host Genetic Associations with Gut Microbiome Diversity in Healthy Individuals, bioRxiv, 2019-02-28","uri":"/reports/a_comprehensive_assessment_of_demographic_environmental_and_host_genetic_associations_with_gut_microbiome_diversity_in_healthy_individuals_56150428/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"N-glycanase 1NGLY1 Deficiency is an ultra-rare and complex monogenic glycosylation disorder that affects fewer than 40 patients globally. NGLY1 Deficiency has been studied in model organisms such as yeast, worms, flies and mice. Proteasomal and mitochondrial homeostasisgene networks are controlled by the evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulator Nrf1, whose activity requires deglycosylation by NGLY1. Hypersensitivity to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is a common phenotype observed in whole animal and cellular models of NGLY1Deficiency. Here we describe unbiased phenotypic drug screens to identify FDA approved drugs, generally recognized as safe natural products and novel chemical entities that rescue growth and development of NGLY1-deficient worm and fly larvae treated with a toxic dose of bortezomib. We used image-based larval size and number assays for use in screens of a 2,560-member drug repurposing library and a 20,240-member lead discovery library. A total of 91 validated hit compounds from primary invertebrate screens were tested in a human cell line in a NRF2 activity assay. NRF2 is a transcriptional regulator that regulates cellular redox homeostasis and it can compensate for loss of Nrf1. Plant-based polyphenols comprise the largest class of hit compounds and NRF2 inducers. Catecholamines and catecholamine receptor activators comprise the second largest class of hits. Steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs comprise the third largest class. Only one compound was active in all assays and species the atypical antipsychotic and dopamine receptor agonist aripiprazole.

Often referred to as living fossils, these taxa preserve many plesiomorphic characteristics used to interpret and reconstruct early osteichthyan feeding conditions. Less attention, however, has been paid to the functional implications of gar-specific morphology, thought to be related to an exclusively ram-based, lateral-snapping mode of prey capture. Previous studies of feeding kinematics in gars have focused solely on members of the narrow-snouted Lepisosteus genus, and here we expand that dataset to include a member of the broad-snouted sister-genus and largest species of gar, the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula, Lacépède, 1803). High-speed videography reveals that the feeding system of alligator gars is capable of rapid expansion from anterior-to-posterior, precisely timed in a way that appears to counteract the effects of a bow-wave during ram-feeding and generate a unidirectional flow of water through the feeding system. Reconstructed cranial anatomy based on contrast-enhanced micro-CT data show that a lateral-sliding palatoquadrate, flexible intrasuspensorial joint, pivoting interhyal, and retractable pectoral girdle are all responsible for increasing the range of motion and expansive capabilities of the gar cranial linkage system. Muscular reconstructions and manipulation experiments show that, while the sternohyoideus is the primary input to the feeding system (similar to other basal actinopterygians), additional input from the hyoid constrictors and hypaxials play an important role in decoupling and modulating between the dual roles of the sternohyoideus hyoid retraction (jaw opening) and hyoid rotation (pharyngeal expansion) respectively. The data presented here demonstrate an intricate feeding mechanism, capable of precise control with plesiomorphic muscles, that represents one of the many ways the ancestral osteichthyan feeding mechanism has been modified for prey capture.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Feeding kinematics and morphology of the alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula, Lacépède, 1803), bioRxiv, 2019-02-28","uri":"/reports/feeding_kinematics_and_morphology_of_the_alligator_gar_atractosteus_spatula_lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de_1803_56154162/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"IQCK","tags":["nature genetics","genetics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Genetic meta-analysis of diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease identifies new risk loci and implicates Aβ, tau, immunity and lipid processing, Nature Genetics, 2019-02-28","uri":"/reports/genetic_meta-analysis_of_diagnosed_alzheimers_disease_identifies_new_risk_loci_and_implicates_a%CE%B2_tau_immunity_and_lipid_processing_56189969/"},{"date":"2019-02-28T00:00:00Z","description":"Human genetic variants causing loss of function (LoF) of protein-coding genes provide natural in vivo models of gene inactivation, which are powerful indicators of gene function and the potential toxicity of therapeutic inhibitors targeting these genes.

Whilst preclinical studies in model organisms have raised some on-target toxicity concerns, the biological consequences of LRRK2 inhibition have not been well characterized in humans. Here we systematically analyse LoF variants in LRRK2 observed across 141,456 individuals sequenced in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and over 4 million participants in the 23andMe genotyped dataset, to assess their impact at a molecular and phenotypic level. After thorough variant curation, we identify 1,358 individuals with high-confidence predicted LoF variants in LRRK2, several with experimental validation. We show that heterozygous LoF of LRRK2 reduces LRRK2 protein level by ~50% but is not associated with reduced life expectancy, or with any specific phenotype or disease state. These data suggest that therapeutics that downregulate LRRK2 levels or kinase activity by up to 50% are unlikely to have major on-target safety liabilities.

Normative brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age (10-75 years) from 7 subcortical volumes, 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area, lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 1,147 male and 1,386 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group.

The difference between predicted brain age and chronological age was calculated to indicate brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD). Findings On average, MDD patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +0.90 (SE 0.21) years (Cohen's d=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.17) compared to controls. Relative to controls, first-episode and currently depressed patients showed higher brain-PAD (+1.2 [0.3] years), and the largest effect was observed in those with late-onset depression (+1.7 [0.7] years). In addition, higher brain-PAD was associated with higher self-reported depressive symptomatology (b=0.05, p=0.004).

Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that species with similar ecological requirements either spatially exclude each other, by preventing the colonization of competitors or by driving coexisting populations to extinction, or show niche divergence when in sympatry. However, the extent and generality of the effect of interspecific competition in trait and biogeographic evolution has been limited by a dearth of appropriate process-generating models to directly test the effect of biotic interactions. Here, we formulate a phylogenetic parametric model that allows interdependence between trait and biogeographic evolution, thus enabling a direct test of central hypotheses on how biotic interactions shape these evolutionary processes. We adopt a Bayesian data augmentation approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of trait histories, range histories, and co-evolutionary process parameters under this analytically intractable model. Through simulations, we show that our model is capable of distinguishing alternative scenarios of biotic interactions. We apply our model to the radiation of Darwin's finches---a classic example of adaptive divergence---and find support for in situ trait divergence in beak size, convergence in traits such as beak shape and tarsus length, and strong competitive exclusion throughout their evolutionary history. Our modeling framework opens new possibilities for testing more complex hypotheses about the processes underlying lineage diversification. More generally, it provides a robust probabilistic methodology to model correlated evolution of continuous and discrete characters.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Interdependent Phenotypic and Biogeographic Evolution Driven by Biotic Interactions, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26","uri":"/reports/interdependent_phenotypic_and_biogeographic_evolution_driven_by_biotic_interactions_56047585/"},{"date":"2019-02-26T00:00:00Z","description":"Cancer is driven by complex evolutionary dynamics involving billions of cells.

In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations' dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Task-evoked activity quenches neural correlations and variability in large-scale brain systems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-26","uri":"/reports/task-evoked_activity_quenches_neural_correlations_and_variability_in_large-scale_brain_systems_56050434/"},{"date":"2019-02-25T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractReconstructing the phylogenetic relationships between species is one of the most formidable tasks in evolutionary biology.

Further, some methods can have undesirable statistical properties such as statistical inconsistency andor the tendency to be positively misleading (i.e. assert strong support for the incorrect tree topology). Recently, deep learning techniques have made inroads on a number of both new and longstanding problems in biological research.

This CNN can readily be trained to make inferences using both gapped and ungapped data. We show that our approach is highly accurate on simulated data, often outperforming traditional methods, and is remarkably robust to bias-inducing regions of parameter space such as the Felsenstein zone and the Farris zone.

By dividing labour, cooperative groups of individuals increase their efficiency, thereby raising group fitness even if these specialized behaviors reduce the fitness of individual group members. Here we provide evidence that antibiotic production in colonies of the multicellular bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is coordinated by a division of labour. We show that S. coelicolor colonies are genetically heterogeneous due to massive amplifications and deletions to the chromosome. Cells with gross chromosomal changes produce an increased diversity of secondary metabolites and secrete significantly more antibiotics; however, these changes come at the cost of dramatically reduced individual fitness, providing direct evidence for a trade-off between secondary metabolite production and fitness. Finally, we show that colonies containing mixtures of mutant strains and their parents produce significantly more antibiotics, while colony-wide spore production remains unchanged.

Genomic data collected over tens of generations in both natural and lab populations is increasingly used to find selected loci underpinning such rapid adaptation. Although selection on large effect loci may be detectable in such data, often the fitness differences between individuals have a polygenic architecture, such that selection at any one locus leads to allele frequency changes that are too subtle to distinguish from genetic drift. However, one promising signal comes from the fact that selection on polygenic traits leads to heritable fitness backgrounds that neutral alleles can become stochastically associated with. These associations perturb neutral allele frequency trajectories, creating autocovariance across generations that can be directly measured from temporal genomic data. We develop theory that predicts the magnitude of these temporal autocovariances, showing that it is determined by the level of additive genetic variation, recombination, and linkage disequilibria in a region. Furthermore, by using analytic expressions for the temporal variances and autocovariances in allele frequency, we demonstrate one can estimate the additive genetic variation for fitness and the drift-effective population size from temporal genomic data. Finally, we also show how the proportion of total variation in allele frequency change due to linked selection can be estimated from temporal data. Temporal genomic data offers strong opportunities to identify the role linked selection has on genome-wide diversity over short timescales, and can help bridge population genetic and quantitative genetic studies of adaptation.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"The Linked Selection Signature of Rapid Adaptation in Temporal Genomic Data, bioRxiv, 2019-02-25","uri":"/reports/the_linked_selection_signature_of_rapid_adaptation_in_temporal_genomic_data_55999683/"},{"date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Background elPrep is an established multi-threaded framework for preparing SAM and BAM files in sequencing pipelines.

We reimplemented elPrep in all three languages and benchmarked their runtime performance and memory use.Results The Go implementation performs best, yielding the best balance between runtime performance and memory use. While the Java benchmarks report a somewhat faster runtime than the Go benchmarks, the memory use of the Java runs is significantly higher.

The development of next-generation sequencing and its decreasing costs promises to alleviate such issues by supplying personal genomic information at a moderate price. Here, we used crowdfunding as an alternative funding source to sequence the genome of Lil BUB, a celebrity cat affected by rare disease phenotypes characterized by supernumerary digits, osteopetrosis and dwarfism, all phenotypic traits that also occur in human patients. We discovered that Lil BUB is affected by two distinct mutations a heterozygous mutation in the limb enhancer of the Sonic hedgehog gene, previously associated with polydactyly in Hemingway cats; and a novel homozygous frameshift deletion affecting the TNFRSF11A (RANK) gene, which has been linked to osteopetrosis in humans. We communicated the progress of this project to a large online audience, detailing the 'inner workings' of personalized whole genome sequencing with the aim of improving genetic literacy.

For IBT, cells were imaged at 0.2-4 pA ion current across 1,000 axial scans. Consecutive subsets of ion beam images were binned over 3 to 20 slices (above and below) to create a resolved image, wherein binning was incremented one slice at a time to yield an enhanced multi-depth data without loss of depth resolution. Algorithmic deconvolution, tailored for ion beams, was then applied to the transformed ion image series using a hybrid deblurring algorithm and an ion beam current-dependent point-spread function. Three-dimensional processing was implemented by segmentation, mesh, molecular neighborhoods, and association maps. In cultured cancer cells and tissues, IBT enabled accessible visualization of three-dimensional volumetric distributions of genomic regions, RNA transcripts, and protein factors with 65-nm lateral and 5-nm axial resolution. IBT also enabled label-free elemental mapping of cells, allowing point of source cellular component measurements not possible for most optical microscopy targets. Detailed multiparameter imaging of subcellular features at near macromolecular resolution should now be made possible by the IBT tools and reagents provided here to open novel venues for interrogating subcellular biology.","tags":["biorxiv","systems-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Ion beam subcellular tomography, bioRxiv, 2019-02-23","uri":"/reports/ion_beam_subcellular_tomography_55924043/"},{"date":"2019-02-23T00:00:00Z","description":"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease that occurs primarily in premature infants.

A potential cause of intragenotypic variability is sensitivity to minute environmental differences during development, even as major environmental parameters are kept constant. Animal enrichment paradigms often include the addition of environmental diversity, whether in the form of social interaction, novel objects, or exploratory opportunities. Enrichment could plausibly affect intragenotypic variability in opposing ways it could cause an increase in variability due to the increase in microenvironmental variation, or a decrease in variability due to elimination of aberrant behavior as animals are taken out of impoverished laboratory conditions. In order to test our hypothesis, we assayed five isogenic Drosophila melanogaster lines raised in control and mild enrichment conditions, and one isogenic line under both mild and intense enrichment conditions. We compared the mean and variability of six behavioral metrics between our enriched fly populations and the laboratory housing control. We found that enrichment often caused a small increase in variability across most of our behaviors, but that the ultimate effect of enrichment on both behavioral means and variabilities was highly dependent on genotype and its interaction with the particular enrichment treatment.

Previous approaches use phylogenetic trees to estimate branch-specific diversification rates. However, all previous approaches disregard diversification-rate shifts on extinct lineages although 99% of species that ever existed are now extinct. Here we describe a lineage-specific birth-death-shift process where lineages, both extant and extinct, may have heterogeneous rates of diversification. To facilitate probability computation we discretize the base distribution on speciation and extinction rates into k rate categories. The fixed number of rate categories allows us to extend the theory of state-dependent speciation and extinction models (e.g., BiSSE and MuSSE) to compute the probability of an observed phylogeny given the set of speciation and extinction rates. To estimate branch-specific diversification rates, we develop two independent and theoretically equivalent approaches numerical integration with stochastic character mapping and data-augmentation with reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We validate the implementation of the two approaches in RevBayes using simulated data and an empirical example study of primates. In the empirical example, we show that estimates of the number of diversification-rate shifts are, unsurprisingly, very sensitive to the choice of prior distribution. Instead, branch-specific diversification rate estimates are less sensitive to the assumed prior distribution on the number of diversification-rate shifts and consistently infer an increased rate of diversification for Old World Monkeys. Additionally, we observe that as few as 10 diversification-rate categories are sufficient to approximate a continuous base distribution on diversification rates. In conclusion, our implementation of the lineage-specific birth-death-shift model in RevBayes provides biologists with a method to estimate branch-specific diversification rates under a mathematically consistent model.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"A Bayesian Approach for Estimating Branch-Specific Speciation and Extinction Rates, bioRxiv, 2019-02-21","uri":"/reports/a_bayesian_approach_for_estimating_branch-specific_speciation_and_extinction_rates_55822262/"},{"date":"2019-02-21T00:00:00Z","description":"High-resolution structural information is essential to understand protein function.

We quantify the strength of these different potential drivers of antimicrobial resistance in order to compare their biological importance. We found that the correlation between antibiotic use in the hospital sector and antibiotic resistance rates is significantly higher than the correlation between resistance rates and any of the other two predictors.

These self-inactivating rabies (SiR) viruses differed from the widely-used first-generation deletion-mutant (ΔG) rabies viruses only by the addition of a destabilization domain to the viral nucleoprotein. However, we observed that the transsynaptic tracing results from that article were inconsistent with the logic described in it, and we hypothesized that the viruses used were actually mutants that had lost the intended modification to the nucleoprotein. We obtained samples of two SiR viruses from the authors and show here that, in both SiR-CRE and SiR-FLPo, the great majority of viral particles were indeed mutants that had lost the intended modification and were therefore just first-generation, ΔG rabies viruses. We also found that SiR-CRE killed 70% of infected neurons in vivo within two weeks. We have shown elsewhere that a ΔG rabies virus encoding Cre can leave a large percentage of labeled neurons alive; we presume that Ciabatti et al. found such remaining neurons at long survival times and mistakenly concluded that they had developed a nontoxic version of rabies virus. Here we have analyzed only the two samples that were sent to MIT by Ciabatti et al., and these may not be from the same batches that were used for their paper. However, 1) both of the two viruses that we analyzed had independently lost the intended modification, 2) the mutations in the two samples were genetically quite distinct from each other yet in both cases caused the same result total or near-total loss of the C-terminal modification, and 3) the mutations that we found in these two virus samples perfectly explain the otherwise-paradoxical transsynaptic tracing results from Ciabatti et al.'s paper.

A striking example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Through manual curation of putative loss of function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative mRNA splicing, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates this exon expression information into variant interpretation. Here, we develop a transcript-level annotation metric, the proportion expressed across transcripts (pext), which summarizes isoform quantifications for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and show that it clearly differentiates between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.4% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental disorders and intellectual disability (DDID) to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have effect sizes similar to those of synonymous variants, while pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases versus controls.

The constant threat of phage infection to bacterial hosts, and the imperative of achieving infection on the part of phages, drives an evolutionary contest in which phage-resistant bacteria emerge, often followed by phages with new routes of infection. This process has received abundant theoretical and experimental attention for decades and forms an important basis for molecular genetics and theoretical ecology and evolution. However, at present, we know very little about the nature of phage-bacteria interaction -- and the evolution of phage resistance -- inside the surface-bound communities that microbes usually occupy in natural environments. These communities, termed biofilms, are encased in a matrix of secreted polymers produced by their microbial residents. Biofilms are spatially constrained such that interactions become limited to neighbors or near-neighbors; diffusion of solutes and particulates is reduced; and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and therefore physiological state. These factors can dramatically impact the way phage infections proceed even in simple, single-strain biofilms, but we still know little of their effect on phage resistance evolutionary dynamics. Here we explore this problem using a computational simulation framework customized for implementing phage infection inside multi-strain biofilms. Our simulations predict that it is far easier for phage-susceptible and phage- resistant bacteria to coexist inside biofilms relative to planktonic culture, where phages and hosts are well-mixed. We characterize the negative frequency dependent selection that underlies this coexistence, and we then test and confirm this prediction using an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy at single-cell and single-phage resolution.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Evolutionary dynamics of phage resistance in bacterial biofilms, bioRxiv, 2019-02-17","uri":"/reports/evolutionary_dynamics_of_phage_resistance_in_bacterial_biofilms_55644817/"},{"date":"2019-02-17T00:00:00Z","description":"Nanopore sequencing offers a portable and affordable alternative to sequencing-by-synthesis methods but suffers from lower accuracy and cannot sequence ultra-short DNA.

Comparing the genome of V. komodoensis with those of related species showed evidence of positive selection in pathways related to muscle energy metabolism, cardiovascular homeostasis, and thrombosis.

To date, a relatively small number of inovirus isolates have been extensively studied, either for biotechnological applications such as phage display, or because of their impact on the toxicity of known bacterial pathogens including Vibrio cholerae and Neisseria meningitidis. Here we show that the current 56 members of the Inoviridae family represent a minute fraction of a highly diverse group of inoviruses. Using a new machine learning approach leveraging a combination of marker gene and genome features, we identified 10,295 inovirus-like genomes from microbial genomes and metagenomes. Collectively, these represent six distinct proposed inovirus families infecting nearly all bacterial phyla across virtually every ecosystem. Putative inoviruses were also detected in several archaeal genomes, suggesting that these viruses may have occasionally transferred from bacterial to archaeal hosts. Finally, we identified an expansive diversity of inovirus-encoded  toxin-antitoxin and gene expression modulation systems, alongside evidence of both synergistic (CRISPR evasion) and antagonistic (superinfection exclusion) interactions with co-infecting viruses which we experimentally validated in a Pseudomonas model.

In addition, it has recently emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen through the acquisition of genetic elements that confer resistance to antibiotics and virulence. We performed a whole-genome sequencing based study on 96 multidrug-resistant E. faecium strains that asymptomatically colonized five patients with the aim to describe the genome dynamics of this species. Results The patients were hospitalized on multiple occasions and isolates were collected over periods ranging from 15 months to 6.5 years. Ninety-five of the sequenced isolates belonged to E. faecium clade A1, which was previously determined to be responsible for the vast majority of clinical infections. The clade A1 strains clustered into six clonal groups of highly similar isolates, three of which entirely consisted of isolates from a single patient. We also found evidence of concurrent colonization of patients by multiple distinct lineages and transfer of strains between patients during hospitalisation. We estimated the evolutionary rate of two clonal groups that colonized a single patient at 12.6 and 25.2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)genomeyear. A detailed analysis of the accessory genome of one of the clonal groups revealed considerable variation due to gene gain and loss events, including the chromosomal acquisition of a 37 kbp prophage and the loss of an element containing carbohydrate metabolism-related genes. We determined the presence and location of twelve different Insertion Sequence (IS) elements, with ISEfa5 showing a unique pattern of location in 24 of the 25 isolates, suggesting widespread ISEfa5 excision and insertion into the genome during gut colonization. Conclusions Our findings show that the E. faecium genome is highly dynamic during asymptomatic colonization of the patient gut. We observe considerable genomic flexibility due to frequent horizontal gene transfer and recombination, which can contribute to the generation of genetic diversity within the species and, ultimately, can contribute to its success as a nosocomial pathogen.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Enterococcus faecium genome dynamics during long-term asymptomatic patient gut colonization, bioRxiv, 2019-02-16","uri":"/reports/enterococcus_faecium_genome_dynamics_during_long-term_asymptomatic_patient_gut_colonization_55572932/"},{"date":"2019-02-16T00:00:00Z","description":"The ability to identify and quantify the constituent plant species that make up a mixed-species sample of pollen has important applications in ecology, conservation, and agriculture. Recently, metabarcoding protocols have been developed for pollen that can identify constituent plant species, but there are strong reasons to doubt that metabarcoding can accurately quantify their relative abundances. A PCR-free, shotgun metagenomics approach has greater potential for accurately quantifying species relative abundances, but applying metagenomics to eukaryotes is challenging due to low numbers of reference genomes. We have developed a pipeline, RevMet (Reverse Metagenomics), that allows reliable and semi-quantitative characterization of the species composition of mixed-species eukaryote samples, such as bee-collected pollen, without requiring reference genomes. Instead, reference species are represented only by 'genome skims' low-cost, low-coverage, shortread sequence datasets. The skims are mapped to individual long reads sequenced from mixed-species samples using the MinION, a portable nanopore sequencing device, and each long read is uniquely assigned to a plant species. We genome-skimmed 49 wild UK plant species, validated our pipeline with mock DNA mixtures of known composition, and then applied RevMet to pollen loads collected from wild bees. We demonstrate that RevMet can identify plant species present in mixed-species samples at proportions of DNA \u0026gt;1%, with few false positives and false negatives, and reliably differentiate species represented by high versus low amounts of DNA in a sample. The RevMet pipeline could readily be adapted to generate semi-quantitative datasets for a wide range of mixed eukaryote samples, which could include characterising diets, quantifying allergenic pollen from air samples, quantifying soil fauna, and identifying the compositions of algal and diatom communities.

GSR effectively removes global artifacts driven by motion and respiration, but also discards globally distributed neural information and introduces negative correlations between certain brain regions. The vast majority of previous studies have focused on the effectiveness of GSR in removing imaging artifacts, as well as its potential biases. Given the growing interest in functional connectivity fingerprinting, here we considered the utilitarian question of whether GSR strengthens or weakens associations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and multiple behavioral measures across cognition, personality and emotion. By applying the variance component model to the Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (GSP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 47% across 23 behavioral measures after GSR. In the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we found that behavioral variance explained by whole-brain RSFC increased by an average of 40% across 58 behavioral measures, when GSR was applied after ICA-FIX de-noising. To ensure generalizability, we repeated our analyses using kernel regression. GSR improved behavioral prediction accuracies by an average of 64% and 12% in the GSP and HCP datasets respectively. Importantly, the results were consistent across methods. A behavioral measure with greater RSFC-explained variance (using the variance component model) also exhibited greater prediction accuracy (using kernel regression). A behavioral measure with greater improvement in behavioral variance explained after GSR (using the variance component model) also enjoyed greater improvement in prediction accuracy after GSR (using kernel regression). Furthermore, GSR appeared to benefit task performance measures more than self-reported measures. Since GSR was more effective at removing motion-related and respiratory-related artifacts, GSR-related increases in variance explained and prediction accuracies were unlikely the result of motion-related or respiratory-related artifacts. However, it is worth emphasizing that the current study focused on whole-brain RSFC, so it remains unclear whether GSR improves RSFC-behavioral associations for specific connections or networks. Overall, our results suggest that at least in the case for young healthy adults, GSR strengthens the associations between RSFC and most (although not all) behavioral measures.

The regulation and integration of neuronal processing between oscillating assemblies at distinct frequencies, and thereby the coordination of distinct computational functions, is thought to be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC). Although many studies have observed CFC locally within a brain region during cognitive processing, the large-scale networks of CFC have remained largely uncharted. Critically, also the validity of prior CFC observations and the presence of true neuronal CFC has been recently questioned because non-sinusoidal or non-zero-mean waveforms that are commonplace in electrophysiological data cause filtering artefacts that lead to false positive CFC findings. We used a unique dataset of stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to chart whole-brain CFC networks from human resting-state brain dynamics. Using a novel graph theoretical method to distinguish true inter-areal CFC from potentially false positive CFC, we show that the resting state is characterized by two separable forms of true inter-areal CFC phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and nm-cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). PAC and CFS large-scale networks coupled prefrontal, visual and sensorimotor cortices, but with opposing anatomical architectures. Crucially also directionalities between low- and high-frequency oscillations were opposite between CFS and PAC. We also found CFC to decay as a function of distance and to be stronger in the superficial than deep layers of the cortex. In conclusion, these results provide conclusive evidence for the presence of two forms of genuine inter-areal CFC and elucidate the large-scale organization of CFC resting-state networks.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Resting-state cross-frequency coupling networks in human electrophysiological recordings, bioRxiv, 2019-02-13","uri":"/reports/resting-state_cross-frequency_coupling_networks_in_human_electrophysiological_recordings_55400952/"},{"date":"2019-02-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Many bacteria interact with target organisms using syringe-like structures called Contractile Injection Systems (CIS).

Recent evidence shows that CIS are specialized to puncture membranes and often deliver effectors to target cells. In many cases, CIS mediate trans-kingdom interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes, however the effectors delivered to target cells and their mode of action are often unknown. In this work, we establish an in vitro model to study a CIS called Metamorphosis Associated Contractile structures (MACs) that target eukaryotic cells.

However, it is unknown whether this greater signalling responses is due to low muscle glycogen per se or to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity - as a first exercise session is necessary to reduce the muscle glycogen stores. In the present study, we manipulated the recovery duration between a first muscle glycogen-depleting exercise and a second exercise session, such that the second exercise session started with reduced muscle glycogen in both approaches but was performed either two or 15 h after the first exercise session (so-called twice-a-day and once-daily approaches, respectively). We found that exercise twice-a-day increased the nuclear abundance of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and potentiated the transcription of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-ɣ coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1a), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa;) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor betadelta (PPARbd) genes, in comparison with the once-daily exercise. These results suggest that the elevated molecular signalling reported with previous train-low approaches can be attributed to performing two exercise sessions in close proximity rather than the reduced muscle glycogen content per se.

Compared to other budding yeasts in the subphylum Saccharomycotina, we noticed that a lineage in the genus Hanseniaspora exhibited very high evolutionary rates, low GC content, small genome sizes, and lower gene numbers. To better understand Hanseniaspora evolution, we analyzed 25 genomes, including 11 newly sequenced, representing 18  21 known species in the genus. Our phylogenomic analyses identify two Hanseniaspora lineages, the fast-evolving lineage (FEL), which began diversifying ~87 million years ago (mya), and the slow-evolving lineage (SEL), which began diversifying ~54 mya. Remarkably, both lineages lost genes associated with the cell cycle and genome integrity, but these losses were greater in the FEL. For example, all species lost the cell cycle regulator WHI5, and the FEL lost components of the spindle checkpoint pathway (e.g., MAD1, MAD2) and DNA damage checkpoint pathway (e.g., MEC3, RAD9). Similarly, both lineages lost genes involved in DNA repair pathways, including the DNA glycosylase gene MAG1, which is part of the base excision repair pathway, and the DNA photolyase gene PHR1, which is involved in pyrimidine dimer repair. Strikingly, the FEL lost 33 additional genes, including polymerases (i.e., POL4 and POL32) and telomere-associated genes (e.g., RIF1, RFA3, CDC13, PBP2). Echoing these losses, molecular evolutionary analyses reveal that, compared to the SEL, the FEL stem lineage underwent a burst of accelerated evolution, which resulted in greater mutational loads, homopolymer instabilities, and higher fractions of mutations associated with the common endogenously damaged base, 8-oxoguanine.

Here we provide a set of 1,854 diverse object concepts sampled systematically from concrete picturable and nameable nouns in the American English language. Using these object concepts, we conducted a large-scale web image search to compile a database of 26,107 high-quality naturalistic images of those objects, with 12 or more object images per concept and all images cropped to square size.

The strong influence of the tissue structure has been convincingly demonstrated in intestinal cancers where adenomas grow by the fission of stem-cell-maintained glands influenced by early expression of abnormal cell mobility in cancer progenitors2, 3. So-called “born to be bad” tumors arise from progenitors which may already possess the necessary driver mutations for malignancy4, 5 and metastasis6. These tumors subsequently evolve neutrally, thereby maximizing intratumoral heterogeneity and increasing the probability of therapeutic resistance. These findings have been nuanced by the advent of multi-region sequencing, which uses spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation among competing tumor cell populations to shed light on the mode of tumor evolution (neutral or Darwinian) and also the tempo4, 7–11. Using a classic, well-studied model of tumor evolution (a passenger-driver mutation model12–16) we systematically alter spatial constraints and cell mixing rates to show how tissue structure influences functional (driver) mutations and genetic heterogeneity over time. This model approach explores a key mechanism behind both inter-patient and intratumoral tumor heterogeneity competition for space. Initial spatial constraints determine the emergent mode of evolution (Darwinian to neutral) without a change in cell-specific mutation rate or fitness effects. Driver acquisition during the Darwinian precancerous stage may be accelerated en route to neutral evolution by the combination of two factors spatial constraints and limited cellular mixing.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Tissue structure accelerates evolution premalignant sweeps precede neutral expansion, bioRxiv, 2019-02-11","uri":"/reports/tissue_structure_accelerates_evolution_premalignant_sweeps_precede_neutral_expansion_55267528/"},{"date":"2019-02-10T00:00:00Z","description":"Genome rearrangements occur in bacteria between repeat sequences and impact growth and gene expression. Homologous recombination can occur between ribosomal operons, which are found in multiple copies in many bacteria. Inversion between indirect repeats and excisiontranslocation between direct repeats enable structural genome rearrangement.

With long read sequencing aiding the routine generation of complete bacterial assemblies, we have developed socru, a typing method for the order and orientation of genome fragments between ribosomal operons, defined against species-specific baselines. It allows for a single identifier to convey the order and orientation of genome level structure and 434 of the most common bacterial species are supported.

Through taking different cell types and assays as an example, we show that with some careful considerations it is possible to achieve very high performance with datasets with as few as 26 images present.

Here, we describe a systematic genome-wide study of variants that create and disrupt human uORFs, and explore their role in human disease using 15,708 whole genome sequences collected by the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) project. We show that 14,897 variants that create new start codons upstream of the canonical coding sequence (CDS), and 2,406 variants disrupting the stop site of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the CDS show signals of selection equivalent to coding loss-of-function variants, and uORF-perturbing variants are under strong selection when arising upstream of known disease genes and genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where perturbation of uORFs is likely to represent an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in families with neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an important and under-recognised functional class that can contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data to study the deleteriousness of specific classes of non-coding variants.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Characterising the loss-of-function impact of 5' untranslated region variants in whole genome sequence data from 15,708 individuals, bioRxiv, 2019-02-08","uri":"/reports/characterising_the_loss-of-function_impact_of_5_untranslated_region_variants_in_whole_genome_sequence_data_from_15708_individuals_55110868/"},{"date":"2019-02-08T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractBackgroundBasecalling, the computational process of translating raw electrical signal to nucleotide sequence, is of critical importance to the sequencing platforms produced by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT).

We also investigate some additional aspects of basecalling training using a taxon-specific dataset, using a larger neural network model and improving consensus basecalls in an assembly by additional signal-level analysis with Nanopolish.ResultsTraining basecallers on taxon-specific data results in a significant boost in consensus accuracy, mostly due to the reduction of errors in methylation motifs. A larger neural network is able to improve both read and consensus accuracy, but at a cost to speed. Improving consensus sequences (‘polishing’) with Nanopolish somewhat negates the accuracy differences in basecallers, but prepolish accuracy does have an effect on post-polish accuracy.ConclusionsBasecalling accuracy has seen significant improvements over the last two years.

We determined the single-particle cryo-EM structure of active dimeric ATP synthase from mitochondria of Polytomella sp. at 2.7- 2.8 Å resolution. Separation of 13 well-defined rotary substates by 3D classification provides a detailed picture of the molecular motions that accompany c-ring rotation and result in ATP synthesis. Crucially, the F1 head rotates along with the central stalk and c-ring rotor for the first ~30° of each 120° primary rotary step. The joint movement facilitates flexible coupling of the stoichiometrically mismatched F1 and Fo subcomplexes. Flexibility is mediated primarily by the interdomain hinge of the conserved OSCP subunit, a well-established target of physiologically important inhibitors. Our maps provide atomic detail of the c-ringa-subunit interface in the membrane, where protonation and deprotonation of c-ring cGlu111 drives rotary catalysis. An essential histidine residue in the lumenal proton access channel binds a strong non-peptide density assigned to a metal ion that may facilitate c-ring protonation, as its coordination geometry changes with c-ring rotation. We resolve ordered water molecules in the proton access and release channels and at the gating aArg239 that is critical in all rotary ATPases.

Conversely, little is known about the mechanisms that control the end of the reproductive phase (floral arrest), despite this being a critical process for optimising fruit and seed production. Complete fruit removal or lack of fertile fruit-set in male sterile mutants, for example male sterile1 (ms1), prevents timely floral arrest in the model plant Arabidopsis. These observations formed the basis for Hensel and colleagues model in which end-of-flowering was proposed to result from a cumulative fruitseed-derived signal that caused simultaneous global proliferative arrest (GPA) in all inflorescences. Recent studies have suggested that end-of-flowering involves gene expression changes at the floral meristem which are at least in part controlled by the FRUITFULL-APETELA2 pathway, however there is limited understanding of how this process is controlled and the communication needed at the whole plant level. Here, we provide new information providing a framework for the fruit-to-meristem (F-M) communication implied by the GPA model. We show that floral arrest in Arabidopsis is not global and does not occur synchronously between branches, but rather that the arrest of each inflorescence is a local process, driven by auxin export from fruit proximal to the inflorescence meristem (IM). Furthermore, we show that inflorescence meristems are only competent for floral arrest once they reach a certain developmental age. Understanding the regulation of floral arrest is of major importance for the future manipulation of flowering to extend and maximise crop yields.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Auxin export from proximal fruits drives arrest in competent inflorescence meristems, bioRxiv, 2019-02-06","uri":"/reports/auxin_export_from_proximal_fruits_drives_arrest_in_competent_inflorescence_meristems_55042090/"},{"date":"2019-02-06T00:00:00Z","description":"Effective vaccines inducing lifelong protection against many important infections such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are not yet available despite decades of research.

In contrast, the milk is colonized in a dynamic fashion with early members opening metabolic niches for the followers. Through large-scale mapping of metabolic preferences and inter-species interactions, we show how microbes poorly suited for milk survive in, and even dominate the community through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between the grain and the liquid phase.

Despite their functional conservation, centromeres are amongst the most rapidly evolving genomic regions and can shape karyotype evolution and speciation across taxa. Although significant progress has been made in identifying centromere-associated proteins, the highly repetitive centromeres of metazoans have been refractory to DNA sequencing and assembly, leaving large gaps in our understanding of their functional organization and evolution. Here, we identify the sequence composition and organization of the centromeres of Drosophila melanogaster by combining long-read sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation for the centromeric histone CENP-A, and high-resolution chromatin fiber imaging. Contrary to previous models that heralded satellite repeats as the major functional components, we demonstrate that functional centromeres form on islands of complex DNA sequences enriched in retroelements that are flanked by large arrays of satellite repeats. Each centromere displays distinct size and arrangement of its DNA elements but is similar in composition overall. We discover that a specific retroelement, G2Jockey-3, is the most highly enriched sequence in CENP-A chromatin and is the only element shared among all centromeres. G2Jockey-3 is also associated with CENP-A in the sister species Drosophila simulans, revealing an unexpected conservation despite the reported turnover of centromeric satellite DNA.

Therefore, quantification of synapses and related neurites from images is vital to gain insights into the underlying pathways of brain functionality and diseases. Despite the wide availability of synaptic punctum imaging data, several issues are impeding satisfactory quantification of these structures by current tools. First, the antibodies used for labeling synapses are not perfectly specific to synapses. These antibodies may exist in neurites or other cell compartments. Second, the brightness for different neurites and synaptic puncta is heterogeneous due to the variation of antibody concentration and synapse-intrinsic differences. Third, images often have low signal to noise ratio due to constraints of experiment facilities and availability of sensitive antibodies. These issues make the detection of synapses challenging and necessitates developing a new tool to easily and accurately quantify synapses.ResultsWe present an automatic probability-principled synapse detection algorithm and integrate it into our synapse quantification tool SynQuant. Derived from the theory of order statistics, our method controls the false discovery rate and improves the power of detecting synapses. SynQuant is unsupervised, works for both 2D and 3D data, and can handle multiple staining channels. Through extensive experiments on one synthetic and three real data sets with ground truth annotation or manual labeling, SynQuant was demonstrated to outperform peer specialized synapse detection tools as well as generic spot detection methods, including 4 unsupervised and 11 variants of 3 supervised methods.AvailabilityJava source code, Fiji plug-in, and test data available at \u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpsgithub.comyu-lab-vtSynQuant\u003ehttpsgithub.comyu-lab-vtSynQuant\u003cjatsext-link\u003e.Contactyug@vt.edu","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"SynQuant An Automatic Tool to Quantify Synapses from Microscopy Images, bioRxiv, 2019-02-02","uri":"/reports/synquant_an_automatic_tool_to_quantify_synapses_from_microscopy_images_54857304/"},{"date":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractInformation within the brain travels from neuron to neuron across billions of synapses.

We aimed to characterise the impact of ND-CNVs on childhood development and investigate whether different ND-CNVs lead to distinct and specific patterns of cognitive and behavioural outcomes.Methods258 children with ND-CNVs (13 CNVs across 9 loci) were systematically assessed for psychiatric disorders as well as broader traits of neurodevelopmental, cognitive and psychopathological origin. A comparison was made with 106 control siblings, in order to test the hypothesis that phenotypes would differ by genotype, both quantitatively, in terms of severity, and qualitatively in the pattern of associated impairments.Outcomes79.8% of ND-CNVs carriers met criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders (OR=13.8 compared to controls) the risk of ADHD (OR=6.9), ODD (OR=3.6), anxiety disorders (OR=2.9), and ASD traits (OR=44.1) was particularly high. ND-CNVs carriers were impaired across all neurodevelopmental, cognitive, and psychopathological traits relative to controls. Only moderate quantitative and qualitative differences in phenotypic profile were found between genotypes. In general, the range of phenotypes was broadly similar for all ND-CNV genotypes. Traits did show some evidence of genotypic specificity, however the specific genotype accounted for a low proportion of variance in outcome (5-20% depending on trait).InterpretationThe 13 ND-CNVs studied have a similar range of adverse effects on childhood neurodevelopment, despite subtle quantitative and qualitative differences. Our findings suggest that genomic risk for neuropsychiatric disorder has pleiotropic effects on multiple processes and neural circuits, and provides important implications for research into genotype-phenotype relationships within psychiatry.FundingThe Medical Research Council and the Waterloo FoundationResearch in contextEvidence before this studySeveral Copy Number Variants (CNVs) have been associated with high risk of development of child and adult neuropsychiatric disorders. Increasingly young children with developmental delay referred for genetic testing are being diagnosed with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric risk CNVs (referred to as ND-CNVs hereafter). It remains unclear whether different genotypes are associated with specific cognitive and behavioural phenotypes or whether these outcomes are non-specific. We searched PubMed for English language studies published from database inception until January 10th, 2019 that investigated the relationship between CNVs and cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Search terms included “CNV”, “genomics”, “1q21.1”, “2p16.3”, “NRXN1”, “9q34”, “Kleefstra Syndrome”, “15q11.2”, “15q13.3”, “16p11.2”, “22q11.2”, “psychiatry”, and “cognition”. Preliminary studies have indicated that deletions and duplications at the same loci may differ in cognitive and behavioural phenotypes. However, to date, there have been limited studies that contrasted the phenotypes of ND-CNVs across several loci on a range of cognitive and behavioural domains.Added value of this studyWe found that young people carrying a ND-CNV were at considerably increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorder and impairments across a range of neurodevelopmental, psychopathological, cognitive, social, sleep and motor traits. Within ND-CNV carriers, comparisons between genotypes indicated moderate quantitative and qualitative differences in overall phenotypic profile, with evidence that severity of impairment was similar across all genotypes for some traits (e.g. mood problems, sleep impairments, peer problems, and sustained attention) whereas for other traits there was evidence of genotype specific effects on severity (e.g., IQ, spatial planning, processing speed, subclinical psychotic experiences, ASD traits, motor coordination total psychiatric symptomatology, particularly anxiety, ADHD, and conduct related traits). However the proportion of variance explained by genotype was low, 5-20% depending on trait, indicating that overall ND-CNVs lead to similar neurodevelopmental outcomes. It is important that genotype-phenotype relationships are viewed through a developmental lens as some phenotypic outcomes were found to be associated with age.Implications of all the available evidenceOur work highlights that children who carry a ND-CNV represent a patient group that warrants clinical and educational attention for a broad range of cognitive and behavioural impairments and that commonalities in clinically relevant neurodevelopmental impairments exist across ND-CNVs. This group of young people could benefit from the development of a general care pathway, to which genotype-specific recommendations can be added where needed. Our work indicates that the relationship between genotype and neurodevelopmental phenotype is complex and that future research will need to take a global systems approach and not be narrowly focused on single phenotypes.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Genotype-phenotype relationships in children with Copy Number Variants associated with high neuropsychiatric risk Findings from the case-control IMAGINE-ID cohort in the United Kingdom, bioRxiv, 2019-01-31","uri":"/reports/genotype-phenotype_relationships_in_children_with_copy_number_variants_associated_with_high_neuropsychiatric_risk_findings_from_the_case-control_imagine-id_cohort_in_the_united_kingdom_54765026/"},{"date":"2019-01-30T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTNaturally occurring functional genetic variation is often employed to identify genetic loci that regulate specific traits.

Here, we develop an approach to use data from many phenotypic traits simultaneously to identify causal genetic loci. Using data for 260 traits scored across a maize diversity panel, we demonstrate that a distinct set of genes are identified relative to conventional genome wide association. The genes identified using this many-trait approach are more likely to be independently validated than the genes identified by conventional analysis of the same dataset. Genes identified by the new many-trait approach share a number of molecular, population genetic, and evolutionary features with a gold standard set of genes characterized through forward genetics. These features, as well as substantially stronger functional enrichment and purification, separate them from both genes identified by conventional genome wide association and from the overall population of annotated gene models.

Large-scale DNA sequencing studies have created a catalogue of naturally occurring genetic variants predicted to cause loss of function in human genes, which in principle should provide powerful in vivo models of human genetic “knockouts” to complement model organism knockout studies and inform drug development. Here, we consider the use of predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) variation catalogued in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) for the evaluation of genes as potential drug targets. Many drug targets, including the targets of highly successful inhibitors such as aspirin and statins, are under natural selection at least as extreme as known haploinsufficient genes, with pLoF variants almost completely depleted from the population. Thus, metrics of gene essentiality should not be used to eliminate genes from consideration as potential targets. The identification of individual humans harboring “knockouts” (biallelic gene inactivation), followed by individual recall and deep phenotyping, is highly valuable to study gene function. In most genes, pLoF alleles are sufficiently rare that ascertainment will be largely limited to heterozygous individuals in outbred populations. Sampling of diverse bottlenecked populations and consanguineous individuals will aid in identification of total “knockouts”. Careful filtering and curation of pLoF variants in a gene of interest is necessary in order to identify true LoF individuals for follow-up, and the positional distribution or frequency of true LoF variants may reveal important disease biology. Our analysis suggests that the value of pLoF variant data for drug discovery lies in deep curation informed by the nature of the drug and its indication, as well as the biology of the gene, followed by recall-by-genotype studies in targeted populations.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Evaluating potential drug targets through human loss-of-function genetic variation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-29","uri":"/reports/evaluating_potential_drug_targets_through_human_loss-of-function_genetic_variation_54627010/"},{"date":"2019-01-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Background With advances in methods for collecting and analyzing fMRI data, there is a concurrent need to understand how to reliably evaluate and optimally use these methods.

Viruses have been considered the most variable component of microbiomes, as supported by virome surveys and examples of high genomic mosaicism. However, recent evidence suggests that the human gut virome is remarkably stable compared to other environments. Here we investigate the origin, evolution, and epidemiology of crAssphage, a widespread human gut virus. Through a global collaboratory, we obtained DNA sequences of crAssphage from over one-third of the world's countries, and showed that its phylogeography is locally clustered within countries, cities, and individuals. We also found colinear crAssphage-like genomes in both Old-World and New-World primates, challenging genomic mosaicism and suggesting that the association of crAssphage with primates may be millions of years old. We conclude that crAssphage is a benign globetrotter virus that may have co-evolved with the human lineage and an integral part of the normal human gut virome.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Global phylogeography and ancient evolution of the widespread human gut virus crAssphage, bioRxiv, 2019-01-27","uri":"/reports/global_phylogeography_and_ancient_evolution_of_the_widespread_human_gut_virus_crassphage_54552786/"},{"date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","description":"The application of time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to EEG and MEG data has become increasingly popular. Traditionally, such time series data are high-pass filtered before analyses, in order to remove slow drifts. Here we show that high-pass filtering should be applied with extreme caution in MVPA, as it may easily create artifacts that result in displacement of decoding accuracy, leading to statistically significant above-chance classification during time periods in which the source is clearly not in brain activity. In both real and simulated EEG data, we show that spurious decoding may emerge with filter cut-off settings from as modest as 0.1 Hz. We provide an alternative method of removing slow drift noise, referred to as robust detrending (de Cheveigne \u0026amp; Arzounian, 2018), which, when applied in concert with masking of cortical events does not result in the temporal displacement of information. We show that temporal generalization may benefit from robust detrending, without any of the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering. However, we conclude that for sufficiently clean data sets, no filtering or detrending at all may work sufficiently well. Implications for other types of data are discussed, followed by a number of recommendations.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"High-pass filtering artifacts in multivariate classification of neural time series data, bioRxiv, 2019-01-27","uri":"/reports/high-pass_filtering_artifacts_in_multivariate_classification_of_neural_time_series_data_54543179/"},{"date":"2019-01-27T00:00:00Z","description":"Ecosystem processes result from interaction between organisms. When interactions are local, the spatial organization of organisms defines their network of interactions, and thus influences the system's functioning. This can be especially relevant for microbial systems, which often consist of spatially structured communities of cells connected by a dense interaction network. Here we measured the spatial interaction network between cells in microbial systems and identify the factors that determine it. Combining quantitative single-cell analysis of synthetic bacterial communities with mathematical modeling, we find that cells only interact with other cells in their immediate neighbourhood. This short interaction range impacts the functioning of the whole system by reducing its ability to perform metabolic processes collectively.

It remains unclear whether there are similar causal effects of obesity traits on other non-communicable diseases. Also, it is largely unexplored whether there are any sex-specific differences in the causal effects of obesity traits on cardiometabolic diseases and other leading causes of death.We constructed sex-specific genetic risk scores (GRS) for three obesity traits; body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and WHR adjusted for BMI, including 565, 324, and 337 genetic variants, respectively. These GRSs were then used as instrumental variables to assess associations between the obesity traits and leading causes of mortality in the UK Biobank using Mendelian randomization. We also investigated associations with potential mediators, including smoking, glycemic and blood pressure traits. Sex-differences were subsequently assessed by Cochran’s Q-test (Phet).A Mendelian randomization analysis of 228,466 women and 195,041 men showed that obesity causes coronary artery disease, stroke (particularly ischemic), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, type 2 and 1 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver disease, and acute and chronic renal failure. Higher BMI led to higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men (Phet=1.4×10-5). Waist-hip-ratio led to a higher risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Phet=3.7×10-6) and higher risk of chronic renal failure (Phet=1.0×10-4) in men than women.Obesity traits have an etiological role in the majority of the leading global causes of death. Sex differences exist in the effects of obesity traits on risk of type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and renal failure, which may have downstream implications for public health.Author summaryObesity is increasing globally and has been linked to major causes of death, such as diabetes and heart disease. Still, the causal effects of obesity on other leading causes of death is relatively unexplored. It is also unclear if any such effects differ between men and women.Mendelian randomization is a method that explores causal relationships between traits using genetic data. Using Mendelian randomization, we investigated the effects of obesity traits on leading causes of death and assessed if any such effects differ between men and women.We found that obesity increases the risks of heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic liver disease. Higher body mass index led to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in women than in men, whereas a higher waist-hip ratio increased risks of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease more in men than in women.In summary, obesity traits are causally involved in the majority of the leading causes of death, and some obesity traits affect disease risk differently in men and women. This has potential implications for public health strategies and indicates that sex-specific preventative measure may be needed.AbbreviationsBMI, Body mass index; CAD coronary artery disease; CLD, chronic liver disease; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; FG, fasting glucose; FI, fasting insulin; GIANT, Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits; GRS, genetic risk score; GWAS, genomewide association study; MAGIC, the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-related traits Consortium; MR, Mendelian randomization; NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; OR, odds ratio; T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SD, standard deviation; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; WHO, the World Health Organization; WHR, waist-hip-ratio; WHRadjBMI, waist-hip-ratio adjusted for body mass index.","tags":["biorxiv","epidemiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Causal relationships between obesity and the leading causes of death in women and men, bioRxiv, 2019-01-26","uri":"/reports/causal_relationships_between_obesity_and_the_leading_causes_of_death_in_women_and_men_54531769/"},{"date":"2019-01-25T00:00:00Z","description":"Obesity and early-stage type 2 diabetes (T2D) increase the risk for many cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The mechanisms linking obesity and T2D to cancer have not been established, preventing targeted interventions. Arguments have been made that hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, or inflammation could drive cancer initiation andor progression. Hyperinsulinemia is a cardinal feature of obesity and T2D, and is independently associated with PDAC incidence and mortality, even in non-obese people. Despite ample human epidemiological evidence linking hyperinsulinemia to PDAC, there is no direct in vivo evidence of a causal role for endogenous insulin in cancer in any system. Using mice with reduced insulin gene dosage, we show here that a modest reduction in endogenous insulin production leads to a ~50% reduction in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pre-cancerous lesions in high fat diet-fed mice expressing the KrasG12D oncogene. The significant reduction in PanIN lesions occurred in the absence of changes in fasting glucose. Reduced insulin also led to a ~50% reduction in pancreatic fibrosis, suggesting that endogenous insulin drives PanIN development, in part, via its pro-fibrotic effects on the stroma surrounding acinar cells and PanIN. Collectively, our data indicate that endogenous insulin hypersecretion contributes causally to pancreatic cancer development.

Here we found that inhibition of transcription or interfering with CTCF ability to bind RNA through mutations of two of its 11 zinc fingers that are not involved with CTCF binding to its cognate site in vitro, zinc finger-1 (ZF1) or -10 (ZF10), disrupt CTCF association to chromatin.

While various approaches have been proposed to account for frequency- and LD-dependent genetic architectures, it remains unclear which estimates of SNP-heritability reported in the literature are reliable. Here we show that genome-wide SNP-heritability can be accurately estimated from biobank-scale data irrespective of the underlying genetic architecture of the trait, without specifying a heritability model or partitioning SNPs by minor allele frequency andor LD. We use theoretical justifications coupled with extensive simulations starting from real genotypes from the UK Biobank (N = 337K) to show that, unlike existing methods, our closed-form estimator for SNP-heritability is highly accurate across a wide range of architectures.

Here we address this basic question in ecology by analyzing patterns of range overlap between related bird species (sister pairs) distributed along a Neotropical elevational gradient. We explicitly contrast the behavioral dimension of interspecific competition (interference competition) with similarity in resource acquisition traits (exploitative competition). We find that behavioral interactions are generally important in setting elevational range limits and preventing coexistence of closely related species. Specifically, close relatives that defend year-round territories tend to live in non-overlapping elevational distributions, while close relatives that do not defend territories tend to broadly overlap in distribution. In contrast, neither similarity in beak morphology nor evolutionary relatedness was associated with patterns of range limitation. Our main result is that interference competition can be an important driver of species ranges at the scale of entire diverse assemblages. Consequently, we suggest that behavioral dimensions of the niche should be more broadly incorporated in macroecological studies.","tags":["biorxiv","ecology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Behavior influences range limits and patterns of coexistence across an elevational gradient in tropical bird diversity, bioRxiv, 2019-01-24","uri":"/reports/behavior_influences_range_limits_and_patterns_of_coexistence_across_an_elevational_gradient_in_tropical_bird_diversity_54385470/"},{"date":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","description":"Lymph nodes (LNs) work as filtering organs, constantly sampling peripheral cues.

LNs undergo 5-fold expansion with every adaptive immune response and yet these ECM-rich structures are not permanently damaged. Whether conduit integrity and filtering functions are affected during cycles of LN expansion and resolution is not known. Here we show that the conduit structure is disrupted during acute LN expansion but FRC-FRC contacts remain intact. In homeostasis, polarised FRCs adhere to the underlying substrate to deposit ECM ba-solaterally. ECM production by FRCs is regulated by the C-type lectin CLEC-2, expressed by dendritic cells (DCs), at transcriptional and secretory levels. Inflamed LNs maintain conduit size-exclusion, but flow becomes leaky, which allows soluble antigens to reach more antigen-presenting cells.

We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons, and medium spiny neurons from the striatum. Cognitive traits were generally associated with similar cell types but their associations were driven by different genes. Neurological diseases were associated with different cell types, which is consistent with other lines of evidence.

The method identifies the precise site of mobile element insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. This is an improvement over previous methods that either rely on curated databases of known mobile elements or rely on 'split-read' alignments that assume the inserted element exists within the reference genome. We apply our approach to 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine prevalent bacterial pathogens, and we identify hundreds of known and novel mobile genetic elements, including many candidate insertion sequences. We find that the mobile element repertoire and insertion rate vary considerably across species, and that many of the identified mobile elements are biased toward certain target sequences, several of them being highly specific. Mobile element insertion hotspots often cluster near genes involved in mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and such insertions are associated with antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Finally, we demonstrate that mutagenesis caused by these mobile elements contributes to antibiotic resistance in a genome-wide association study of mobile element insertions in pathogenic Escherichia coli. In summary, by applying a de novo approach to precisely identify mobile genetic elements and their insertion sites, we thoroughly characterize the mobile element repertoire and insertion spectrum of nine pathogenic bacterial species and find that mobile element insertions play a significant role in the evolution of clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Mobile genetic element insertions drive antibiotic resistance across pathogens, bioRxiv, 2019-01-24","uri":"/reports/mobile_genetic_element_insertions_drive_antibiotic_resistance_across_pathogens_54409093/"},{"date":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","description":"Large reservoirs of natural gas in the oceanic subsurface sustain a complex biosphere of anaerobic microbes, including recently characterized archaeal lineages that extend the potential to mediate hydrocarbon oxidation (methane and butane) beyond the Methanomicrobia.

Wnt ligands can be instructive or permissive during PCP-dependent processes, and Wnt pathway mutants are often classified as PCP mutants due to the complexity and the similarities between their phenotypes. Our studies of the zebrafish sensory lateral line reveal that disruptions of the PCP and Wnt pathways have differential effects on hair cell orientations. While mutations in PCP genes cause random orientations of hair cells, mutations in Wnt pathway members induce hair cells to adopt a concentric pattern. We show that PCP signaling is normal in hair cells of Wnt pathway mutants and that the concentric hair cell phenotype is due to altered organization of the surrounding support cells. Thus, the PCP and Wnt pathways work in parallel, as separate pathways to establish proper hair cell orientation. Our data suggest that coordinated support cell organization is established during the formation of lateral line primordia, much earlier than the appearance of hair cells.

We show that the minimal selective concentration was increased by more than one order of magnitude for both antibiotics when embedded in the community.

Overproduction of oxalate occurs in the liver due to an inherited genetic defect in the enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT), causing pathology due to the insolubility of calcium oxalate crystals in body fluids. The main current therapy is dual liver-kidney transplant, which incurs high morbidity and has poor availability in some health systems where PH1 is more prevalent. One approach currently in active clinical investigation targets HAO1 (hydroxyacid oxidase 1), encoding glycolate oxidase, to reduce substrate levels for oxalate production. To inform drug development, we sought individuals with reduced HAO1 function due to naturally occurring genetic variation. Analysis of loss of function variants in 141,456 sequenced individuals suggested individuals with complete HAO1 knockout would only be observed in 1 in 30 million outbred people. However in a large sequencing and health records program (Genes \u0026amp; Health), in populations with substantial autozygosity, we identified a healthy adult individual predicted to have complete knockout of HAO1 due to an ultra rare homozygous frameshift variant (rs1186715161, ENSP00000368066.3p.Leu333SerfsTer4). Primary care and hospital health records confirmed no apparently related clinical phenotype. At recall, urine and plasma oxalate levels were normal, however plasma glycolate levels (171 nmolmL) were 12 times the upper limit of normal in healthy, reference individuals (mean+2sd=14 nmolmL, n=67) while her urinary glycolate levels were 6 times the upper limit of normal. Comparison with preclinical and phase 1 clinical trial data of an RNAi therapeutic targeting HAO1 (lumasiran) suggests the individual likely retains \u0026lt;2% residual glycolate oxidase activity. These results provide important data to support the safety of HAO1 inhibition as a potential chronic therapy for a devastating metabolic disease (PH1). We also suggest that the effect of glycolate oxidase suppression in any potential other roles in humans beyond glycolate oxidation do not lead to clinical phenotypes, at least in this specific individual. This demonstrates the value of studying the lifelong complete knockdown of a target protein in a living human to aid development of a potential therapeutic, both in de-risking the approach and providing potential hypotheses to optimize its development. Furthermore, therapy for PH1 is likely to be required lifelong, in contrast to data from chronicity studies in non-human species or relatively short-term therapeutic studies in people. Our approach demonstrates the potential for improved drug discovery through unlocking relevant evidence hiding in the diversity of human genetic variation.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Deep phenotyping of a healthy human HAO1 knockout informs therapeutic development for primary hyperoxaluria type 1., bioRxiv, 2019-01-19","uri":"/reports/deep_phenotyping_of_a_healthy_human_hao1_knockout_informs_therapeutic_development_for_primary_hyperoxaluria_type_1._54137671/"},{"date":"2019-01-19T00:00:00Z","description":"Pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens have recently emerged as a powerful method for functionally characterizing regulatory elements in the non-coding genome, but off-target effects in these experiments have not been systematically evaluated.

Surprisingly, the primary drivers of signal in this screen were single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with low specificity scores. After removing these guides, we found that there were no CTCF loop anchors critical for cell growth. We also observed this effect in an independent screen fine-mapping the core motifs in enhancers of the GATA1 gene. We then conducted screens in parallel with CRISPRi and CRISPRa, which do not induce DNA damage, and found that an unexpected and distinct set of off-targets also caused strong confounding growth effects with these epigenome-editing platforms. Promisingly, strict filtering of CRISPRi libraries using GuideScan specificity scores removed these confounded sgRNAs and allowed for the identification of essential enhancers, which we validated extensively.

The basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, where ~146 base pair increments of the genome are wrapped and compacted around the core histone proteins. Further genomic organization and compaction occur through higher order assembly of nucleosomes. This organization regulates many nuclear processes, and is controlled in part by histone post-transtranslational modifications and chromatin-binding proteins. Mechanisms that regulate the assembly and compaction of the genome remain unclear. Here we show that in the presence of physiologic concentrations of mono- and divalent salts, histone tail-driven interactions drive liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of nucleosome arrays, resulting in substantial condensation. Phase separation of nucleosomal arrays is inhibited by histone acetylation, whereas histone H1 promotes phase separation, further compaction, and decreased dynamics within droplets, mirroring the relationship between these modulators and the accessibility of the genome in cells. These results indicate that under physiologically relevant conditions, LLPS is an intrinsic behavior of the chromatin polymer, and suggest a model in which the condensed phase reflects a genomic 'ground state' that can produce chromatin organization and compaction in vivo. The dynamic nature of this state could enable known modulators of chromatin structure, such as post-translational modifications and chromatin binding proteins, to act upon it and consequently control nuclear processes such as transcription and DNA repair. Our data suggest an important role for LLPS of chromatin in the organization of the eukaryotic genome.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Organization and Regulation of Chromatin by Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation, bioRxiv, 2019-01-18","uri":"/reports/organization_and_regulation_of_chromatin_by_liquid-liquid_phase_separation_54101027/"},{"date":"2019-01-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Transposable elements are abundant genetic components of eukaryotic genomes with important regulatory features affecting transcription, splicing, and recombination, among others.

The formation of these boundaries is coupled to the upregulation of directional transcription from MERVL, which results in the activation of a subset of the gene expression programme of the 2-cell stage embryo. Domain boundaries in the 2-cell stage embryo are transient and can be remodelled without undergoing cell division. Remarkably, we find extensive inter-strain MERVL variation, suggesting multiple non-overlapping rounds of recent genome invasion and a high regulatory plasticity of genome organisation.

We observed that an IFN-cured population of replicon-harboring HGT cells (HGT-cured) was enhanced in their ability to replicate transfected HuNoV RNA compared to parental HGT cells, suggesting that differential gene expression in HGT-cured cells created an environment favouring norovirus replication. Microarray analysis was used to identify genes differentially regulated in HGT-NV and HGT-cured compared to parental HGT cells. We found that the IFN lambda receptor alpha (IFNLR1) expression was highly reduced in HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells. All three cell lines responded to exogenous IFN-β by inducing interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), however, HGT-NV and HGT-cured failed to respond to exogenous IFN-λ. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine partially reactivated IFNLR1 expression in HGT-NV and IFN-cured cells suggesting that host adaptation occurred via epigenetic reprogramming. In line with this, ectopic expression of the IFN-λ receptor alpha rescued HGT-NV and HGT-cured cells response to IFN-λ. We conclude that type III IFN is important in inhibiting HuNoV replication in vitro and that the loss of IFNLR1 enhances replication of HuNoV.

Here we describe the first single cell triple-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the exit from pluripotency and the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. We find dynamic dependencies between the different molecular layers, with evidence for distinct modes of epigenetic regulation. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of local lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements, driven by loss of methylation in enhancer marks and a concomitant increase of chromatin accessibility. In striking contrast, the epigenetic landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or epigenetically remodelled prior to overt cell fate decisions during gastrulation, providing the molecular logic for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Single cell multi-omics profiling reveals a hierarchical epigenetic landscape during mammalian germ layer specification Supplementary Figures, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14","uri":"/reports/single_cell_multi-omics_profiling_reveals_a_hierarchical_epigenetic_landscape_during_mammalian_germ_layer_specification_supplementary_figures_53889608/"},{"date":"2019-01-14T00:00:00Z","description":"BrieflyAnalysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data from mouse neocortex exposes evidence for local neuropeptidergic modulation networks that involve every cortical neuron directly.Data Highlights\u003cjatslist list-type=bullet\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eAt least 98% of mouse neocortical neurons express one or more of 18 neuropeptide precursor proteins (NPP) genes.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eAt least 98% of cortical neurons express one or more of 29 neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eNeocortical expression of these 18 NPP and 29 NP-GPCR genes is highly neuron-type-specific and permits exceptionally powerful differentiation of transcriptomic neuron types.\u003cjatslist-item\u003e\u003cjatslist-item\u003eNeuron-type-specific expression of 37 cognate NPP  NP-GPCR gene pairs predicts modulatory connectivity within 37 or more neuron-type-specific intracortical networks.\u003cjatslist-item\u003eSummarySeeking insight into homeostasis, modulation and plasticity of cortical synaptic networks, we analyzed results from deep RNA-Seq analysis of 22,439 individual mouse neocortical neurons. This work exposes transcriptomic evidence that all cortical neurons participate directly in highly multiplexed networks of modulatory neuropeptide (NP) signaling. The evidence begins with a discovery that transcripts of one or more neuropeptide precursor (NPP) and one or more neuropeptide-selective G-protein-coupled receptor (NP-GPCR) genes are highly abundant in nearly all cortical neurons. Individual neurons express diverse subsets of NP signaling genes drawn from a palette encoding 18 NPPs and 29 NP-GPCRs. Remarkably, these 47 genes comprise 37 cognate NPPNP-GPCR pairs, implying a strong likelihood of dense, cortically localized neuropeptide signaling. Here we use neuron-type-specific NP gene expression signatures to put forth specific, testable predictions regarding 37 peptidergic neuromodulatory networks that may play prominent roles in cortical homeostasis and plasticity.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Evidence for Dense Intracortical Neuropeptide Networks, bioRxiv, 2019-01-14","uri":"/reports/single-cell_transcriptomic_evidence_for_dense_intracortical_neuropeptide_networks_53890159/"},{"date":"2019-01-13T00:00:00Z","description":"The capacity to infer the mental states of others (known as cognitive empathy) is essential for social interactions, and a well-known theory proposes that it is negatively affected by intrauterine testosterone exposure.

Many of the hunter-gatherer populations persisting today live in Africa, perhaps because agropastoral transitions occurred later on the continent. Here, we present the first genomic data from the Chabu, a relatively isolated and marginalized hunting-and-gathering group from the Southwestern Ethiopian highlands. The Chabu are a distinct genetic population that carry the highest levels of Southwestern Ethiopian ancestry of any extant population studied thus far. This ancestry has been in situ for at least 4,500 years. We show that the Chabu are undergoing a severe population bottleneck which began around 40 generations ago. We also study other Eastern African populations and demonstrate divergent patterns of historical population size change over the past 60 generations between even closely related groups.

Further, insulin dysregulation that accompanies obesity is linked to cognitive decline, depression, anxiety, and aberrant motivation that also rely on excitatory transmission in the NAc, but potential mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that insulin receptor activation increases presynaptic glutamate release via a previously unidentified form of opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, whereas activation of IGF receptors by insulin decreases presynaptic glutamate release in the NAc. Furthermore, obesity results in a loss of the insulin receptor-mediated increases and a reduction in NAc insulin receptor surface expression, while preserving reductions in excitatory transmission mediated by IGF receptors. These results provide the first insights into how insulin influences excitatory transmission in the adult brain and have broad implications for the regulation of motivation and reward related processes by peripheral hormones.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Insulin enhances presynaptic glutamate release in the nucleus accumbens via opioid receptor-mediated disinhibition, bioRxiv, 2019-01-12","uri":"/reports/insulin_enhances_presynaptic_glutamate_release_in_the_nucleus_accumbens_via_opioid_receptor-mediated_disinhibition_53825585/"},{"date":"2019-01-12T00:00:00Z","description":"Isogenic laboratory mouse strains are used to enhance reproducibility as individuals within a strain are essentially genetically identical.

However, laboratory mouse strains are living reagents and hence genetic drift occurs and is an unavoidable source of accumulating genetic variability that can have an impact on reproducibility over time. Nearly 20 years after the first release of the mouse reference genome, individuals from the strain it represents (C57BL6J) are at least 26 inbreeding generations removed from the individuals used to generate the mouse reference genome. Moreover, C57BL6J is now maintained through the periodic reintroduction of mice from cryopreserved embryo stocks that are derived from a single breeder pair, aptly named C57BL6J Adam and Eve. To more accurately represent the genome of today's C57BL6J mice, we have generated a de novo assembly of the C57BL6J Eve genome (B6Eve) using high coverage, long-read sequencing, optical mapping, and short-read data. Using these data, we addressed recurring variants observed in previous mouse studies. We have also identified structural variations that impact coding sequences, closed gaps in the mouse reference assembly, some of which are in genes, and we have identified previously unannotated coding sequences through long read sequencing of cDNAs.

We also demonstrated that the technique is equally capable of identifying the cell-of-origin for a series of 2,044 metastatic samples from 22 of the tumor types available as primaries. Moreover, cancer drivers, whether inherited or acquired, reside in active chromatin regions in the respective cell-of-origin.

Outer envelope protein, chloroplast unusual positioning1 (CHUP1), anchors chloroplasts to the host-pathogen interface. Stromules are induced during infection in a CHUP1-dependent manner, embracing haustoria and interconnecting chloroplasts, to form dynamic organelle clusters.

We examine this proposal by combining diffusion analysis and extreme value theory to derive a probabilistic formulation of its dynamics. Perhaps counter-intuitively, a macro-mutation is much more unlikely a priori than multiple mutations with smaller fitness effects, yet both hypotheses predict fixation with high conditional probability.

Good behavioral prediction should in theory require RSFC to be sufficiently distinct across participants; if RSFC were the same across participants, then behavioral prediction would obviously be poor. Therefore, we hypothesize that removing common resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) signals that are shared across participants would improve behavioral prediction. Here, we considered 803 participants from the human connectome project (HCP) with four rs-fMRI runs. We applied the common and orthogonal basis extraction (COBE) technique to decompose each HCP run into two subspaces a common (group-level) subspace shared across all participants and a subject-specific subspace. We found that the first common COBE component of the first HCP run was localized to the visual cortex and was unique to the run. On the other hand, the second common COBE component of the first HCP run and the first common COBE component of the remaining HCP runs were highly similar and localized to regions within the default network, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. Overall, this suggests the presence of run-specific (state-specific) effects that were shared across participants. By removing the first and second common COBE components from the first HCP run, and the first common COBE component from the remaining HCP runs, the resulting RSFC improves behavioral prediction by an average of 11.7% across 58 behavioral measures spanning cognition, emotion and personality.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Individual-Specific fMRI-Subspaces Improve Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior Supplemental, bioRxiv, 2019-01-10","uri":"/reports/individual-specific_fmri-subspaces_improve_functional_connectivity_prediction_of_behavior_supplemental_53717163/"},{"date":"2019-01-10T00:00:00Z","description":"The brain constructs distributed representations of key low-dimensional variables.

Though data collection and analyses are conducted at the voxel level, inferences are often based on anatomical regions. The discrepancy between the unit of analysis and the unit of inference leads to ambiguity and flexibility in analyses that can create a false sense of reproducibility. For example, hypothesizing effects on “amygdala activity” does not provide a falsifiable and reproducible definition of precisely which voxels or which patterns of activation should be observed. Rather, it comprises a large number of unspecified sub-hypotheses, leaving room for flexible interpretation of findings, which we refer to as “model degrees of freedom.” From a survey of 135 functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies in which researchers claimed replications of previous findings, we found that 42.2% of the studies did not report any quantitative evidence for replication such as activation peaks. Only 14.1% of the papers used exact coordinate-based or a priori pattern-based models. Of the studies that reported peak information, 42.9% of the ‘replicated’ findings had peak coordinates more than 15 mm away from the ‘original’ findings, suggesting that different brain locations were activated, even when studies claimed to replicate prior results. To reduce the flexible and qualitative region-level tests in neuroimaging studies, we recommend adopting quantitative spatial models and tests to assess the spatial reproducibility of findings. Techniques reviewed here include permutation tests on peak distance, Bayesian MANOVA, and a priori multivariate pattern-based models. These practices will help researchers to establish precise and falsifiable spatial hypotheses, promoting a cumulative science of neuroimaging.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"False-positive neuroimaging Undisclosed flexibility in testing spatial hypotheses allows presenting anything as a replicated finding, bioRxiv, 2019-01-09","uri":"/reports/false-positive_neuroimaging_undisclosed_flexibility_in_testing_spatial_hypotheses_allows_presenting_anything_as_a_replicated_finding_53697323/"},{"date":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"\\(\\left| {\\hat r_{\\mathrm{g}}} \\right|\\)","tags":["nature genetics","genetics","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Genome-wide association analyses of risk tolerance and risky behaviors in over 1 million individuals identify hundreds of loci and shared genetic influences, Nature Genetics, 2019-01-09","uri":"/reports/genome-wide_association_analyses_of_risk_tolerance_and_risky_behaviors_in_over_1_million_individuals_identify_hundreds_of_loci_and_shared_genetic_influences_53918655/"},{"date":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Genetic screens performed using high-throughput fluorescent microscopes have generated large datasets that have contributed many insights into cell biology.

In C. elegans, wounding the epidermal epithelium triggers both an immune reaction and a repair response. Exactly how these are controlled, and the degree to which they are inter-connected remains unclear. To address these questions, we established a simple system for simultaneously inflicting precise laser wounds and imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution. We show that in C. elegans, wounding provokes a rapid sealing of the plasma membrane, involving reorganisation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate domains. This is followed by a radial recruitment at the wound site of EBP-2EB1, a protein that binds the plus ends of microtubules. EB1 recruitment is accompanied by a reorganisation of microtubules, required for the subsequent recruitment of actin and wound closure. It is also required for the directed trafficking towards the site of injury of the key signaling protein SNF-12. In the absence of SNF-12 recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response. Our results suggest that microtubule dynamics coordinate the cytoskeletal changes required for wound repair and the concomitant activation of the innate immune response.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2019"],"title":"Microtubule plus-end dynamics link wound repair to the innate immune response, bioRxiv, 2019-01-07","uri":"/reports/microtubule_plus-end_dynamics_link_wound_repair_to_the_innate_immune_response_53552872/"},{"date":"2019-01-06T00:00:00Z","description":"Genome-level evolutionary inference (i.e., phylogenomics) is becoming an increasingly essential step in many biologists' work - such as in the characterization of newly recovered genomes, or in leveraging available reference genomes to guide evolutionary questions. Accordingly, there are several tools available for the major steps in a phylogenomics workflow. But for the biologist whose main focus is not bioinformatics, much of the computational work required - such as accessing genomic data on large scales, integrating genomes from different file formats, performing required filtering, stitching different tools together, etc. - can be prohibitive. Here I introduce GToTree, a command-line tool that can take any combination of fasta files, GenBank files, andor NCBI assembly accessions as input and outputs an alignment file, estimates of genome completeness and redundancy, and a phylogenomic tree based on the specified single-copy gene (SCG) set. While GToTree can work with any custom hidden Markov Models (HMMs), also included are 13 newly generated SCG-set HMMs for different lineages and levels of resolution, built based on searches of ~12,000 bacterial and archaeal high-quality genomes.

In this situation, a natural strategy is to train the model on experimental data from some cell types and evaluate performance on one or more held-out cell types. In this work, we show that when the training set contains examples derived from the same genomic loci across multiple cell types, the resulting model can be susceptible to a particular form of bias related to memorizing the average activity associated with each genomic locus. Consequently, the trained model may appear to perform well when evaluated on the genomic loci that it was trained on but tends to perform poorly on loci that it was not trained on. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using epigenomic measurements and nucleotide sequence to predict gene expression and chromatin domain boundaries, and we suggest methods to diagnose and avoid the pitfall.

Yet the causes of differential diversification are little known despite their relevance for sustaining biodiversity into the future. Here we investigate rates of species diversification across extant Mammalia, a compelling system that includes our own closest relatives. We develop a new phylogeny of nearly all ∼6000 species using a 31-gene supermatrix and fossil node- and tip-dating approaches to establish a robust evolutionary timescale for mammals. Our findings link the causes of uneven modern species richness with ecologically-driven variation in rates of speciation andor extinction, including 24 detected shifts in net diversification. Speciation rates are a stronger predictor of among-clade richness than clade age, countering claims of clock-like speciation in large phylogenies. Surprisingly, speciation rate heterogeneity in recent radiations shows limited association with latitude, despite the well-known increase in species richness toward the equator. Instead, we find a deeper-time association where clades of high-latitude species have the highest speciation rates, suggesting that species durations are shorter (turnover is higher) outside than inside the tropics. At shallower timescales (i.e., young clades), diurnality and low vagility are both linked to greater speciation rates and extant richness. We suggest that high turnover among small-ranged allopatric species has erased the signal of vagility in older clades, while diurnality has adaptively promoted lineage persistence. These findings highlight the underappreciated joint roles of ephemeral (turnover-based) and adaptive (persistence-based) processes of diversification, which manifest in recent and more ancient evolutionary radiations of mammals to explain modern diversity.Author SummaryThe over 6000 living species in the mammalian tree of life are distributed unevenly among branches so that similarly aged groups sometimes differ many fold in species richness (e.g., ∼2500 rodent species versus 8 pangolins). Why differential bursts of species diversification occur, and how long they persist, has implications for sustaining biodiversity. Here we develop a robust evolutionary timescale for most extant species, recovering signatures of rate-variable diversification linked to ecological factors. Mammals with low dispersal or that are day-active show the fastest recent speciation rates, consistent with mechanisms of allopatric isolation and ecological opportunity, respectively. Speciation is surprisingly faster in extra-tropical than tropical lineages, suggesting that longer species durations for tropical lineages underpin the latitudinal diversity gradient in mammal.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Ecological causes of uneven diversification and richness in the mammal tree of life, bioRxiv, 2019-01-05","uri":"/reports/ecological_causes_of_uneven_diversification_and_richness_in_the_mammal_tree_of_life_53474875/"},{"date":"2019-01-04T00:00:00Z","description":"Aims Several factors are known to increase risk for cerebrovascular disease and dementia, but there is limited evidence on associations between multiple vascular risk factors (VRFs) and detailed aspects of brain macro- and microstructure in large community-dwelling populations across middle- and older age. Methods and Results Associations between VRFs (smoking, hypertension, pulse pressure, diabetes, hypercholersterolaemia, BMI, and waist-hip ratio) and both global and regional brain structural and diffusion MRI markers were examined in UK Biobank (N = 9722, age range 44-77 years). A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R2 ≤ 1.8%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker. Conclusion Higher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macro- and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres.

In response, the U.S. government dramatically reduced the number of diplomats posted at the U.S. embassy in Havana. U.S. officials initially believed a sonic attack might be responsible for their ailments. The sound linked to these attacks, which has been described as a high-pitched beam of sound, was recorded by U.S. personnel in Cuba and released by the Associated Press (AP). Because these recordings are the only available non-medical evidence of the sonic attacks, much attention has focused on identifying health problems and the origin of the acoustic signal. As shown here, the calling song of the Indies short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus celerinictus) matches, in nuanced detail, the AP recording in duration, pulse repetition rate, power spectrum, pulse rate stability, and oscillations per pulse. The AP recording also exhibits frequency decay in individual pulses, a distinct acoustic signature of cricket sound production. While the temporal pulse structure in the recording is unlike any natural insect source, when the cricket call is played on a loudspeaker and recorded indoors, the interaction of reflected sound pulses yields a sound virtually indistinguishable from the AP sample. This provides strong evidence that an echoing cricket call, rather than a sonic attack or other technological device, is responsible for the sound in the released recording. Although the causes of the health problems reported by embassy personnel are beyond the scope of this paper, our findings highlight the need for more rigorous research into the source of these ailments, including the potential psychogenic effects, as well as possible physiological explanations unrelated to sonic attacks.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Recording of sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats in Cuba spectrally matches the echoing call of a Caribbean cricket, bioRxiv, 2019-01-04","uri":"/reports/recording_of_sonic_attacks_on_u.s._diplomats_in_cuba_spectrally_matches_the_echoing_call_of_a_caribbean_cricket_53461299/"},{"date":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Traditional neurobiological theories of musical emotions explain well why extreme music such as punk, hardcore or metal, whose vocal and instrumental characteristics share much similarity with acoustic threat signals, should evoke unpleasant feelings for a large proportion of listeners. Why it doesn't for metal music fans, however, remains a theoretical challenge metal fans may differ from non-fans in how they process acoustic threat signals at the sub-cortical level, showing deactivated or reconditioned responses that differ from controls. Alternatively, it is also possible that appreciation for metal depends on the inhibition by cortical circuits of a normal low-order response to auditory threat. In a series of three experiments, we show here that, at a sensory level, metal fans actually react equally negatively, equally fast and even more accurately to cues of auditory threat in vocal and instrumental contexts than non-fans. Conversely, cognitive load somewhat appears to reduce fans' appreciation of metal to the level reported by non-fans. Taken together, these results are not compatible with the idea that extreme music lovers do so because of a different low-level response to threat, but rather, highlight a critical contribution of higher-order cognition to the aesthetic experience. These results are discussed in the light of recent higher-order theories of emotional consciousness, which we argue should be generalized to the emotional experience of music across musical genres.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2019"],"title":"Enjoy The Violence Is appreciation for extreme music the result of cognitive control over the threat response system?, bioRxiv, 2019-01-03","uri":"/reports/enjoy_the_violence_is_appreciation_for_extreme_music_the_result_of_cognitive_control_over_the_threat_response_system_53390267/"},{"date":"2019-01-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes use multiple sensory modalities to hunt human hosts to obtain a blood-meal for egg production. Attractive cues include carbon dioxide (CO2), a major component of exhaled breath [1, 2]; heat elevated above ambient temperature, signifying warm-blooded skin [3, 4]; and dark visual contrast [5, 6], proposed to bridge long-range olfactory and short-range thermal cues [7]. Any of these sensory cues in isolation is an incomplete signal of a human host, and so a mosquito must integrate multi-modal sensory information before committing to approaching and biting a person [8]. Here, we study the interaction of visual cues, heat, and CO2 to investigate the contributions of human-associated stimuli to host-seeking decisions. We show that tethered flying mosquitoes strongly orient toward dark visual contrast regardless of CO2 stimulation and internal host-seeking status. This suggests that attraction to visual contrast is general, and not contingent on other host cues. In free-flight experiments with CO2, adding a dark contrasting visual cue to a warmed surface enhanced host-seeking. Moderate warmth became more attractive to mosquitoes, and mosquitoes aggregated on the cue at all non-noxious temperatures. Gr3 mutants, unable to detect CO2, were lured to the visual cue at ambient temperatures, but fled and did not return when the surface was warmed to host-like temperatures. This suggests that attraction to thermal cues is contingent on the presence of the additional human sensory cue CO2.

Intuitively, we expect the learning capacity of a neural circuit to grow with the number of neurons and synapses. Larger brains tend to be found in species with higher cognitive function and learning ability. Similarly, adding connections and units to artificial neural networks can allow them to solve more complex tasks. However, we show that in a biologically relevant setting where synapses introduce an unavoidable amount of noise, there is an optimal size of network for a given task. Beneath this optimal size, our analysis shows how adding apparently redundant neurons and connections can make tasks more learnable. Therefore large neural circuits can either devote connectivity to generating complex behaviors, or exploit this connectivity to achieve faster and more precise learning of simpler behaviors. Above the optimal network size, the addition of neurons and synaptic connections starts to impede learning performance. This suggests that overall brain size may be constrained by the need to learn efficiently with unreliable synapses, and may explain why some neurological learning deficits are associated with hyperconnectivity. Our analysis is independent of specific learning rules and uncovers fundamental relationships between learning rate, task performance, network size and intrinsic noise in neural circuits.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2019"],"title":"Fundamental bounds on learning performance in neural circuits, bioRxiv, 2019-01-01","uri":"/reports/fundamental_bounds_on_learning_performance_in_neural_circuits_53324811/"},{"date":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) poses a significant challenge for drug brain delivery.

To enable a better assessment of disease risk and improve diagnosis, a precision health platform that integrates non-invasive functional measurements and clinical tests combined with whole genome sequencing (WGS) was developed. The platform included WGS, comprehensive quantitative non-contrast whole body (WB) and brain magnetic resonance imagingangiography (MRIMRA), computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, continuous cardiac monitoring, clinical laboratory tests, and metabolomics. In our cohort, 24.3% had medically significant genetic findings (MSF) which may contribute to increased risk of disease. A total of 206 unique medically significant variants in 111 genes were identified, and forty individuals (3.4%) had more than one MSF. Phenotypic testing revealed 34.2% of our cohort had a metabolomics profile suggestive of insulin resistance, 29.2% had elevated liver fat identified by MRI, 16.4% had clinically important cardiac structure or cardiac function abnormalities on cardiac MRI or ECHO, 8.8% had a high cardiovascular risk on CT coronary artery calcium scoring (Agatston calcium score \u0026gt; 400, Relative Risk of 7.2), 8.0% had arrhythmia found on continuous rhythm monitoring, 6.5% had cardiac conduction disorders found on EKG, 2% had previously undetected tumors detected by WB MRI, and 2.5% had previously undetected aneurysms detected by non-contrast MRIMRA. Using family histories, personal histories, and test results, clinical and phenotypic findings were correlated with genomic findings in 130 study participants (63.1%) with high to moderate penetrance variants, suggesting the precision health platform improves the diagnostic process in asymptomatic individuals who were at risk. Cardiovascular and endocrine diseases achieved considerable clinical associations between MSFs and clinical phenotypes (89% and 72%, respectively). These findings demonstrate the value of integrating WGS and noninvasive clinical assessments for a rapid and integrated point-of-care clinical diagnosis of age-related diseases that contribute to premature mortality.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Precision Medicine Advancements Using Whole Genome Sequencing, Noninvasive Whole Body Imaging, and Functional Diagnostics, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18","uri":"/reports/precision_medicine_advancements_using_whole_genome_sequencing_noninvasive_whole_body_imaging_and_functional_diagnostics_52788699/"},{"date":"2018-12-18T00:00:00Z","description":"Microtubules are dynamic polymers that are used for intracellular transport and chromosome segregation during cell division. Their instability stems from the low energy of tubulin dimer interactions, which sets the growing polymer close to its disassembly conditions. Microtubules function in coordination with kinesin and dynein molecular motors, which use ATP hydrolysis to produce mechanical work and move on microtubules. This raises the possibility that the forces produced by walking motors can break dimer interactions and trigger microtubule disassembly. We tested this hypothesis by studying the interplay between microtubules and moving molecular motors in vitro. Our results show that the mechanical work of molecular motors can remove tubulin dimers from the lattice and rapidly destroy microtubules. This effect was not observed when free tubulin dimers were present in the assay. Using fluorescently labelled tubulin dimers we found that dimer removal by motors was compensated for by the insertion of free tubulin dimers into the microtubule lattice. This self-repair mechanism allows microtubules to survive the damage induced by molecular motors as they move along their tracks. Our study reveals the existence of coupling between the motion of kinesin and dynein motors and the renewal of the microtubule lattice.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Self-repair protects microtubules from their destruction by molecular motors, bioRxiv, 2018-12-18","uri":"/reports/self-repair_protects_microtubules_from_their_destruction_by_molecular_motors_52789425/"},{"date":"2018-12-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractHow we process ongoing experiences is shaped by our personal history, current needs, and future goals.

Through a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging, facial expression tracking, and self-reported emotional experiences across four studies, our data suggest that the vmPFC slowly transitions through a series of discretized states that broadly map onto affective experiences.

While much of this gender bias can be explained by historic sexism and discrimination, there is concern that women may still be disadvantaged by the peer review process if reviewers' unconscious biases lead them to reject publications with female authors more often. One potential solution to this perceived gender bias in the reviewing process is for journals to adopt double-blind reviews whereby neither the authors nor the reviewers are aware of each other's identities and genders. To test the efficacy of double-blind reviews, we assigned gender to every authorship of every paper published in 5 different journals with different peer review processes (double-blind vs. single blind) and subject matter (birds vs. behavioral ecology) from 2010-2018 (n = 4865 papers). While female authorships comprised only 35% of the total, the double-blind journal Behavioral Ecology did not have more female authorships than its single-blind counterparts. Interestingly, the incidence of female authorship is higher at behavioral ecology journals (Behavioral Ecology and Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) than in the ornithology journals (Auk, Condor, Ibis), for papers on all topics as well as those on birds. These analyses suggest that double-blind review does not currently increase the incidence of female authorship in the journals studied here. We conclude, at least for these journals, that double-blind review does not benefit female authors and may, in the long run, be detrimental.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"The Case For and Against Double-blind Reviews, bioRxiv, 2018-12-16","uri":"/reports/the_case_for_and_against_double-blind_reviews_52725309/"},{"date":"2018-12-14T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSmall proteins likely abound in prokaryotes, and may mediate much of the communication that occurs between organisms within a microbiome and their host. Unfortunately, small proteins are traditionally overlooked in biology, in part due to the computational and experimental difficulties in detecting them. To systematically identify novel small proteins, we carried out a large comparative genomics study on 1,773 HMP human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites (mouth, gut, skin and vagina). We describe more than four thousand conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; ~30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain, and almost half are not represented in reference genomes, emphasizing the incompleteness of knowledge in this space. Our analysis exposes putative novel ‘housekeeping’ small protein families, including a potential novel ribosomally associated protein, as well as ‘mammalian-specific’ or ‘human-specific’ protein families. By analyzing the genomic neighborhood of small genes, we pinpoint a subset of families that are potentially associated with defense against bacteriophage. Finally, we identify families that may be subject to horizontal transfer and are thus potentially involved in adaptation of bacteria to the changing human environment.

Here we show RNase-sensitive CTCF self-association in vitro and that an RNA-binding region (RBR) mediates CTCF clustering in vivo. Intriguingly, deleting the RBR abolishes or impairs almost half of all chromatin loops in mouse embryonic stem cells. Disrupted loop formation correlates with abrogated clustering and diminished chromatin binding of the RBR mutant CTCF protein, which in turn results in a failure to halt cohesin-mediated extrusion. Thus, CTCF loops fall into at least 2 classes RBR-independent and RBR-dependent loops. We suggest that evidence for distinct classes of RBR-dependent loops may provide a mechanism for establishing cell-specific CTCF loops regulated by RNAs and other RBR partner.","tags":["biorxiv","biophysics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"An RNA-binding region regulates CTCF clustering and chromatin looping, bioRxiv, 2018-12-13","uri":"/reports/an_rna-binding_region_regulates_ctcf_clustering_and_chromatin_looping_52608001/"},{"date":"2018-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryThe success of immunotherapy has led to a myriad of new clinical trials.

In this context, periodicity refers to the time interval between the same phases of two consecutive cell cycles. The length of this interval, or the cell cycle speed, varies widely depending on cell type and the pathophysiological conditions. The relevance of cell cycle speed in various biological contexts has not been well-studied, partially due to the lack of experimental approaches that capture this parameter. Here, we describe a genetically encoded live-cell reporter of cell cycle speed. This reporter is based on the color-changing Fluorescent Timer (FT) protein, which emits blue fluorescence when newly synthesized before maturing into a red fluorescent protein. Its ability to report cell cycle speed exploits the different half-life of the blue vs. red form of the same molecule, as predicted by mathematical modeling. When a Histone H2B-FT fusion protein is expressed at steady-state in heterogeneously dividing cells, faster-cycling cells can be distinguished from slower-cycling ones by differences in their intracellular ratio between the blue and red fluorescent wavelengths. Cell cycle perturbation experiments demonstrate that the H2B-FT is a bona fide reporter of cell cycle speed in multiple cultured cell lines. In vivo, the bluered profile faithfully tracked with known proliferation kinetics of various hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, when expressed either from lentiviral vectors or from a targeted knock-in allele. As the H2B-FT is compatible with flow cytometry, it provides a strategy to physically separate subpopulations of live cells cycling at different rates for downstream analysis. We anticipate this system to be useful in diverse cell types and tissue contexts for dissecting the role of cell cycle speed in development and disease.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"A fluorescent reporter enables instantaneous measurement of cell cycle speed in live cells, bioRxiv, 2018-12-12","uri":"/reports/a_fluorescent_reporter_enables_instantaneous_measurement_of_cell_cycle_speed_in_live_cells_52553188/"},{"date":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","description":"Leaf stomata are microscopic pores mediating plant-environment interactions. Their role in carbon uptake and transpiration make them prime candidates for improving water use efficiency (WUE).

However, little is known about the genetic basis of SD in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and to what extant genetic variation exists in contemporary wheat germplasm. Here, we evaluated stomatal patterning over two growing seasons in a set of 333 wheat lines, representing the European winter wheat germplasm. Stomatal patterning was mainly determined by two underlying traits, the distance between files of stomata and the distance between stomata within a file. By haplotype association mapping, quantitative trait loci for SD were consistently detected in both seasons on wheat chromosomes (CHR) 2A, 3A and 7B. The single nucleotide polymorphism markers most significantly associated with SD coincided with the genes INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) and STOMATAL CYTOKINESIS-DEFECTIVE 1 (SCD1) on CHR 3A, and genes involved in ethylene and auxin signaling on CHR 2A and 7B, respectively.

Consequently, our knowledge of the capacity and dynamics of HGT in complex communities is limited. Here, we utilize the CRISPR-Cas spacer acquisition process to detect HGT events from complex microbiota in real-time and at nucleotide resolution. In this system, a recording strain is exposed to a microbial sample, spacers are acquired from foreign transferred elements and permanently stored in genomic CRISPR arrays. Subsequently, sequencing and analysis of these spacers enables identification of the transferred elements. This approach allowed us to quantify transfer frequencies of individual mobile elements without the need for phenotypic markers or post-transfer replication. We show that HGT in human clinical fecal samples can be extensive and rapid, often involving multiple different plasmid types, with the IncX type being the most actively transferred. Importantly, the vast majority of transferred elements did not carry readily selectable phenotypic markers, highlighting the utility of our approach to reveal previously hidden real-time dynamics of mobile gene pools within complex microbiomes.","tags":["biorxiv","microbiology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Real-time capture of horizontal gene transfers from gut microbiota by engineered CRISPR-Cas acquisition, bioRxiv, 2018-12-11","uri":"/reports/real-time_capture_of_horizontal_gene_transfers_from_gut_microbiota_by_engineered_crispr-cas_acquisition_52487723/"},{"date":"2018-12-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractElectrically conductive pili from Geobacter species, termed bacterial “nanowires”, are intensely studied for their biological significance and potential in the development of new materials.

Many approaches to reconstruct evolutionary histories focus on a limited number of informative statistics describing distributions of allele frequencies or patterns of linkage disequilibrium. We show that many commonly used statistics are part of a broad family of two-locus moments whose expectation can be computed jointly and rapidly under a wide range of scenarios, including complex multi-population demographies with continuous migration and admixture events. A full inspection of these statistics reveals that widely used models of human history fail to predict simple patterns of linkage disequilibrium. To jointly capture the information contained in classical and novel statistics, we implemented a tractable likelihood-based inference framework for demographic history. Using this approach, we show that human evolutionary models that include archaic admixture in Africa, Asia, and Europe provide a much better description of patterns of genetic diversity across the human genome. We estimate that an unidentified, deeply diverged population admixed with modern humans within Africa both before and after the split of African and Eurasian populations, contributing 4 - 8% genetic ancestry to individuals in world-wide populations.Author SummaryThroughout human history, populations have expanded and contracted, split and merged, and ex-changed migrants. Because these events affected genetic diversity, we can learn about human history by comparing predictions from evolutionary models to genetic data. Here, we show how to rapidly compute such predictions for a wide range of diversity measures within and across populations under complex demographic scenarios. While widely used models of human history accurately predict common measures of diversity, we show that they strongly underestimate the co-occurence of low frequency mutations within human populations in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Models allowing for archaic admixture, the relatively recent mixing of human populations with deeply diverged human lineages, resolve this discrepancy. We use such models to infer demographic models that include both recent and ancient features of human history. We recover the well-characterized admixture of Neanderthals in Eurasian populations, as well as admixture from an as-yet unknown diverged human population within Africa, further suggesting that admixture with deeply diverged lineages occurred multiple times in human history.

We designed a multi-tissue comparative study of gene expression and DNA methylation in primates that minimizes confounding effects by using a balanced design with respect to species, tissues, and individuals. We also developed a comparative analysis pipeline that minimizes biases due to sequence divergence. We thus present the most comprehensive catalog of similarities and differences in gene expression and methylation levels between livers, kidneys, hearts, and lungs, in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques. We estimate that overall, only between 7 to 11% (depending on the tissue) of inter-species differences in gene expression levels can be accounted for by corresponding differences in promoter DNA methylation. However, gene expression divergence in conserved tissue-specific genes can be explained by corresponding inter-species methylation changes more often.

Yet, the extent to which the advent of agriculture may have impacted the evolution of the human immune system remains unknown. Here we present a comparative study of variation in the transcriptional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to bacterial and viral stimuli between Batwa rainforest hunter-gatherers and Bakiga agriculturalists from Uganda. We observed increased divergence between hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in the transcriptional response to viruses compared to that for bacterial stimuli. We demonstrate that a significant fraction of these transcriptional differences are under genetic control, and we show that positive natural selection has helped to shape population differences in immune regulation. Across the set of genetic variants underlying inter-population immune response differences, however, the signatures of positive selection were disproportionately observed in the rainforest hunter-gatherers. This result is counter to expectations based on the popularized notion that shifts in pathogen exposure due to the advent of agriculture imposed radically heightened selective pressures in agriculturalist populations.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Natural selection contributed to immunological differences between human hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05","uri":"/reports/natural_selection_contributed_to_immunological_differences_between_human_hunter-gatherers_and_agriculturalists_52201024/"},{"date":"2018-12-05T00:00:00Z","description":"Summary We introduce and implement two measures for quantifying genealogical concordance in phylogenomic datasets the gene concordance factor (gCF) and the site concordance factor (sCF).

The sensory organs underlying vibration detection, called slit sensilla, resemble cracks in the spider's exoskeleton, and are distributed all over the spider body. Those crucial to sensing web- and other substrate-borne vibrations are called lyriform organs and are densely distributed around leg joints. It has been shown that forces that cause bending at leg joints also activate these lyriform organs. Little is known of how the biomechanics of the body of a freely-suspended spider in its natural posture interact with vibrations introduced into the body and how this affects vibration perception. Female black widow spiders, in particular, have a striking body-form; their long thin legs support a large pendulous abdomen. Here, we show that in their natural posture, the large abdominal mass of black widow females, interacts with the spring-like behaviour of their leg joints and determines the mechanical behaviour of different leg joints. Furthermore, we find that adopting different body postures enables females to alter both the level and tuning of the mechanical input to lyriform organs. Therefore, we suggest that posture may be used to flexibly and reversibly focus attention to different classes or components of web vibration. Postural effects thus emphasize the dynamic loop of interactions between behaviour and perception, i.e. between 'brain' and body.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Posture controls mechanical tuning in the black widow spider mechanosensory system, bioRxiv, 2018-12-05","uri":"/reports/posture_controls_mechanical_tuning_in_the_black_widow_spider_mechanosensory_system_52202031/"},{"date":"2018-12-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractPolygenic scores (PS) are becoming a useful tool to identify individuals with high genetic risk for complex diseases and several projects are currently testing their utility for translational applications. It is also tempting to use PS to assess whether genetic variation can explain a part of the geographic distribution of a phenotype. However, it is not well known how population genetic properties of the training and target samples affect the geographic distribution of PS. Here, we evaluate geographic differences, and related biases, of PS in Finland with geographically well-defined sample of 2,376 individuals from the National FINRISK study. First, we detect geographic differences in PS for coronary artery disease (CAD), rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia, waits-hip ratio (WHR), body-mass index (BMI) and height, but not for Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Second, we use height as a model trait to thoroughly assess the possible population genetic biases in PS and apply similar approaches to the other phenotypes. Most importantly, we detect suspiciously large accumulation of geographic differences for CAD, WHR, BMI and height, suggesting bias arising from population genetic structure rather than from a direct genotype-phenotype association. This work demonstrates how sensitive the geographic patterns of current PS are for small biases even within relatively homogenous populations and provides simple tools to identify such biases.

Despite the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the B.Br.001002 strains are very closely related. The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in B. anthracis population. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to this polytomy is suggesting that this polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe.

This taxon contrasts with another group of fossils from those sites assigned to A. africanus. The anatomical reasons for why these groupings should not be lumped together (as is frequently done for the South African fossils) are discussed in detail. In support of this classification, we also present for the first time a palate (StW 576 from Sterkfontein Member 4) newly reconstructed by RJC, which has a uniquely complete adult dentition of an A. africanus. The StW 573 skull also has certain similarities with other earlier Australopithecus fossils in East Africa, A. afarensis and A. anamensis, which are discussed. One of its most interesting features is a pattern of very heavy anterior dental wear unlike that found in A. africanus but resembling that found in A. anamensis at 4.17 Ma.

Because of high mutation and recombination rates, genome replication by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases leads to populations of closely related viruses that are generally referred to as ‘quasispecies’. Although standard (short-read) sequencing technologies allow to readily determine consensus sequences for these ‘quasispecies’, it is far more difficult to reconstruct large numbers of full-length haplotypes of (i) RNA virus genomes and (ii) subgenome-length (sg) RNAs comprised of noncontiguous genome regions that may be present in these virus populations. Here, we used a full-length, direct RNA sequencing (DRS) approach without any amplification step to characterize viral RNAs produced in cells infected with a human coronavirus representing one of the largest RNA virus genomes known to date.Using DRS, we were able to map the longest (~26 kb) contiguous read to the viral reference genome. By combining Illumina and nanopore sequencing, a highly accurate consensus sequence of the human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E genome (27.3 kb) was reconstructed. Furthermore, using long reads that did not require an assembly step, we were able to identify, in infected cells, diverse and novel HCoV-229E sg RNAs that remain to be characterized. Also, the DRS approach, which does not require reverse transcription and amplification of RNA, allowed us to detect methylation sites in viral RNAs. Our work paves the way for haplotype-based analyses of viral quasispecies by demonstrating the feasibility of intra-sample haplotype separation. We also show how supplementary short-read sequencing (Illumina) can be used to reduce the error rate of nanopore sequencing.Even though a number of technical challenges remain to be addressed to fully exploit the potential of the nanopore technology, our work illustrates that direct RNA sequencing may significantly advance genomic studies of complex virus populations, including predictions on long-range interactions in individual full-length viral RNA haplotypes.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Direct RNA nanopore sequencing of full-length coron-avirus genomes provides novel insights into structural variants and enables modification analysis, bioRxiv, 2018-12-01","uri":"/reports/direct_rna_nanopore_sequencing_of_full-length_coron-avirus_genomes_provides_novel_insights_into_structural_variants_and_enables_modification_analysis_52025490/"},{"date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryWe present the largest exome sequencing study of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to date (n=35,584 total samples, 11,986 with ASD).

We applied GOTI to both the CRISPR-Cas9 and base editing (BE3) systems by editing one blastomere of the two-cell mouse embryo and then compared whole genome sequences of progeny-cell populations at E14.5 stage. Sequence analysis of edited and non-edited cell progenies showed that undesired off-target single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are rare (average 10.5) in CRISPR-edited mouse embryos, with a frequency close to the spontaneous mutation rate. By contrast, BE3 editing induced over 20-fold higher SNVs (average 283), raising the concern of using base-editing approaches for biomedical application.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Base editing generates substantial off-target single nucleotide variants, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27","uri":"/reports/base_editing_generates_substantial_off-target_single_nucleotide_variants_51825046/"},{"date":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTAnticipating forest responses to changing climate and disturbance regimes requires understanding long-term successional processes and aggregating these local processes into global relevance. Estimates of existing forest structure and biomass are improving globally; however, vegetation models continue to show substantial spread in predictions of future land carbon uptake and the roles of forest structural change and demography are increasingly being recognized as important. To identify mechanisms that drive change in tree size, density, and carbon, we need a better understanding of forest structural trajectories and the factors that affect those trajectories. Here we reveal a coherent, cyclic pattern of structural change in temperate forests, as predicted by successional theory, and identify significant sensitivity to climatic precipitation and temperature anomalies using large datasets and empirical modeling. For example, in the eastern US above average temperature (+1°C) was associated with a 27% (−0.4±0.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) reduction in productivity attributed to higher rates of disease (+23%), weather disturbance (+57%), and sapling mortality. Projections of future vegetative carbon sink potential suggests biomass would be lowest on managed lands (72±2 Mg C ha-1) and highest when larger trees survive in undisturbed conditions (153±21 Mg C ha-1). Overall, the indirect effects of disturbance and mortality were considerably larger than the direct effects of climate on productivity when predicting future vegetative carbon sinks. Results provide robust comparisons for global vegetation models, and valuable projections for management and carbon mitigation efforts.","tags":["biorxiv","ecology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Climate or disturbance temperate forest structural change and carbon sink potential, bioRxiv, 2018-11-27","uri":"/reports/climate_or_disturbance_temperate_forest_structural_change_and_carbon_sink_potential_51853375/"},{"date":"2018-11-27T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDue to the advent and utility of high-throughput sequencing, modern biomedical research abounds with multivariate count data.

Due to the novelty of such data, computational methods are still actively being developed and options for the error-correction of RNA-sequencing long reads remain limited.ResultsIn this article, we evaluate the extent to which existing long-read DNA error correction methods are capable of correcting cDNA Nanopore reads. We provide an automatic and extensive benchmark tool that not only reports classical error-correction metrics but also the effect of correction on gene families, isoform diversity, bias towards the major isoform, and splice site detection. We find that long read error-correction tools that were originally developed for DNA are also suitable for the correction of RNA-sequencing data, especially in terms of increasing base-pair accuracy.

While apparently evolutionarily conserved1–12, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) is not well understood at the molecular or behavioral levels. Here we describe our discovery that C. elegans can pass on a learned pathogenic avoidance behavior to their progeny for several generations through epigenetic mechanisms. Although worms are initially attracted to the gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa (PA14)13, they can learn to avoid this pathogen13. We found that prolonged PA14 exposure results in transmission of avoidance behavior to progeny that have themselves never been exposed to PA14, and this behavior persists through the fourth generation. This form of transgenerational inheritance of bacterial avoidance is specific to pathogenic P. aeruginosa, requires physical contact and infection, and is distinct from CREB-dependent long-term associative memory and larval imprinting. The TGF-β ligand daf-7, whose expression increases in the ASJ upon initial exposure to PA1414, is highly expressed in the ASI neurons of progeny of trained mothers until the fourth generation, correlating with transgenerational avoidance behavior. Mutants of histone modifiers and small RNA mediators display defects in naïve PA14 attraction and aversive learning. By contrast, the germline-expressed PRG-1Piwi homolog15 is specifically required for transgenerational inheritance of avoidance behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel and natural paradigm of TEI that may optimize progeny decisions and subsequent survival in the face of changing environmental conditions.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"C. elegans pathogenic learning confers multigenerational pathogen avoidance, bioRxiv, 2018-11-22","uri":"/reports/c._elegans_pathogenic_learning_confers_multigenerational_pathogen_avoidance_51528447/"},{"date":"2018-11-22T00:00:00Z","description":"Introductory ParagraphCuriosity is often portrayed as a desirable feature of human faculty.

Here, with a set of three behavioural and two neuroimaging experiments including novel stimuli that strongly trigger curiosity (i.e. magic tricks), we examined the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the irresistible lure of curiosity. We consistently demonstrated that across different samples people were indeed willing to gamble to expose themselves to physical risks (i.e. electric shocks) in order to satisfy their curiosity for trivial knowledge that carries no apparent instrumental values. Also, underlying this seductive power of curiosity is its incentive salience properties, which share common neural mechanisms with extrinsic incentives (i.e. hunger for foods).

A growing literature suggests that DNNs outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of neuroimaging applications, yet there are few direct comparisons of relative utility. Here, we compared the performance of three DNN architectures and a classical machine learning algorithm (kernel regression) in predicting individual phenotypes from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns. One of the DNNs was a generic fully-connected feedforward neural network, while the other two DNNs were recently published approaches specifically designed to exploit the structure of connectome data. By using a combined sample of almost 10,000 participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and UK Biobank, we showed that the three DNNs and kernel regression achieved similar performance across a wide range of behavioral and demographic measures. Furthermore, the generic feedforward neural network exhibited similar performance to the two state-of-the-art connectome-specific DNNs. When predicting fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank, performance of all algorithms dramatically improved when sample size increased from 100 to 1000 subjects. Improvement was smaller, but still significant, when sample size increased from 1000 to 5000 subjects. Importantly, kernel regression was competitive across all sample sizes. Overall, our study suggests that kernel regression is as effective as DNNs for RSFC-based behavioral prediction, while incurring significantly lower computational costs. Therefore, kernel regression might serve as a useful baseline algorithm for future studies.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Deep Neural Networks and Kernel Regression Achieve Comparable Accuracies for Functional Connectivity Prediction of Behavior and Demographics, bioRxiv, 2018-11-20","uri":"/reports/deep_neural_networks_and_kernel_regression_achieve_comparable_accuracies_for_functional_connectivity_prediction_of_behavior_and_demographics_51420417/"},{"date":"2018-11-20T00:00:00Z","description":"Behavior arises from neuronal activity, but it is not known how the active neurons are distributed across brain regions and how their activity unfolds in time.

We were able to create longitudinal representations of disease progression mapping over 300 common diseases, including the well-known complication of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. Surprisingly, out of these generated disease trajectories, we discovered an unknown association between schizophrenia, a chronic mental disorder, and rhabdomyolysis, a rare disease of muscle breakdown.

More fundamentally, how HP1 action at the level of a single nucleosome drives chromatin compaction remains poorly understood. Here we directly demonstrate that the S. pombe HP1 protein, Swi6, compacts arrays of multiple nucleosomes into phase-separated droplets. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange, NMR, and mass-spectrometry, we further find that Swi6 substantially increases the accessibility and dynamics of buried histone residues within a mononucleosome. Restraining these dynamics via site-specific disulfide bonds impairs the compaction of nucleosome arrays into phase-separated droplets. Our results indicate that chromatin compaction and phase separation can be highly coupled processes. Further, we find that such coupling is promoted by a counter-intuitive function of Swi6, namely disorganization of the octamer core. Phase separation is canonically mediated by weak and dynamic multivalent interactions. We propose that dynamic exposure of buried histone residues increases opportunities for multivalent interactions between nucleosomes, thereby coupling chromatin compaction to phase separation.

The synthetic oscillator, when introduced into both Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium maintains regular oscillations with a constant period in generations across growth conditions. We determine the phase of oscillation from individual bacteria using image analysis of resultant colonies and thereby infer the number of cell divisions elapsed.

To-date most research has focused on the biological consequences of DNA Methylscape changes whereas its impact on DNA physicochemical properties remains unexplored. Herein, we examine the effect of levels and genomic distribution of methylcytosines on the physicochemical properties of DNA to detect the Methylscape biomarker. We find that DNA polymeric behaviour is strongly affected by differential patterning of methylcytosine, leading to fundamental differences in DNA solvation and DNA-gold affinity between cancerous and normal genomes. We exploit these Methylscape differences to develop simple, highly sensitive and selective electrochemical or colorimetric one-step assays for the detection of cancer.

Proprioceptive sensing of the position of rigid joints has been described in detail in several systems, however it is not known how animals with an elastic skeleton encode their body positions. Understanding how diverse larval body positions are dynamically encoded requires knowledge of proprioceptor activity patterns in vivo during natural movement. Here we applied high-speed volumetric SCAPE microscopy to simultaneously track the position, physical deformation, and temporal patterns of intracellular calcium activity of multidendritic proprioceptors in crawling Drosophila larvae. During the periodic segment contraction and relaxation that occurs during crawling, proprioceptors with diverse morphologies showed sequential onset of activity throughout each periodic episode. A majority of these proprioceptors showed activity during segment contraction with one neuron type activated by segment extension. Different timing of activity of contraction-sensing proprioceptors was related to distinct dendrite terminal targeting, providing a continuum of position encoding during all phases of crawling. These dynamics could endow different proprioceptors with specific roles in monitoring the progression of contraction waves, as well as body shape during other behaviors. We provide activity measurements during exploration as one example. Our results provide powerful new insights into the body-wide neuronal dynamics of the proprioceptive system in crawling Drosophila, and demonstrate the utility of our approach for characterization of neural encoding throughout the nervous system of a freely behaving animal.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Characterization of proprioceptive system dynamics in behaving Drosophila larvae using high-speed volumetric microscopy, bioRxiv, 2018-11-12","uri":"/reports/characterization_of_proprioceptive_system_dynamics_in_behaving_drosophila_larvae_using_high-speed_volumetric_microscopy_51038018/"},{"date":"2018-11-12T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSpontaneous and sensory-evoked activity propagates across spatial scales in the mammalian cortex but technical challenges have generally precluded establishing conceptual links between the function of local circuits of neurons and brain-wide network dynamics.

Bees have convergently evolved eusociality up to five times, providing a framework to test this hypothesis. To examine potential links between putative gene regulatory elements and social evolution, we compare alignable, non-coding sequences in eleven diverse bee species, encompassing three independent origins of reproductive division of labor and two elaborations of eusocial complexity. We find that rates of evolution in a number of non-coding sequences correlate with key social transitions in bees. Interestingly, while we find little evidence for convergent rate changes associated with independent origins of social behavior, a number of molecular pathways exhibit convergent rate changes in conjunction with subsequent elaborations of social organization. We also present evidence that many novel non-coding regions may have been recruited alongside the origin of sociality in corbiculate bees; these loci could represent gene regulatory elements associated with division of labor within this group. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that gene regulatory innovations are associated with the evolution of eusociality and illustrate how a thorough examination of both coding and non-coding sequence can provide a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Rate variation in the evolution of non-coding DNA associated with social evolution in bees, bioRxiv, 2018-11-08","uri":"/reports/rate_variation_in_the_evolution_of_non-coding_dna_associated_with_social_evolution_in_bees_50953621/"},{"date":"2018-11-07T00:00:00Z","description":"Photosynthetic organisms provide food and energy for nearly all life on Earth, yet half of their protein-coding genes remain uncharacterized1,2.

With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of ∼ 106 cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes. Harmony is a fast and flexible general purpose integration algorithm that enables the identification of shared fine-grained subpopulations across a variety of experimental and biological conditions.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Fast, sensitive, and accurate integration of single cell data with Harmony, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05","uri":"/reports/fast_sensitive_and_accurate_integration_of_single_cell_data_with_harmony_50722347/"},{"date":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","description":"Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today’s most accurate models of the primate brain’s ventral visual stream.

Studying the intertwined roles of sensation, experience and directed action in navigation has been made easier by the development of virtual reality (VR) environments for head-fixed animals, which allow for quantitative measurements of behavior in well-controlled sensory conditions. VR has long featured in studies of Drosophila melanogaster, but these experiments have typically relied on one-dimensional (1D) VR, effectively allowing the fly to change only its heading in a visual scene, and not its position. Here we explore how flies navigate in a two-dimensional (2D) visual VR environment that more closely resembles their experience during free behavior. We show that flies’ interaction with landmarks in 2D environments cannot be automatically derived from their behavior in simpler 1D environments. Using a novel paradigm, we then demonstrate that flies in 2D VR adapt their behavior in a visual environment in response to optogenetically delivered appetitive and aversive stimuli. Much like free-walking flies after encounters with food, head-fixed flies respond to optogenetic activation of sugar-sensing neurons by initiating a local search behavior. Finally, by pairing optogenetic activation of heat-sensing cells to the flies’ presence near visual landmarks of specific shapes, we elicit selective learned avoidance of landmarks associated with aversive “virtual heat”. These head-fixed paradigms set the stage for an interrogation of fly brain circuitry underlying flexible navigation in complex visual environments.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"On the adaptive behavior of head-fixed flies navigating in two-dimensional, visual virtual reality, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05","uri":"/reports/on_the_adaptive_behavior_of_head-fixed_flies_navigating_in_two-dimensional_visual_virtual_reality_50722645/"},{"date":"2018-11-05T00:00:00Z","description":"SummarySingle-cell computational pipelines involve two critical steps organizing cells (clustering) and identifying the markers driving this organization (differential expression analysis).

This process is thought to be driven by sexual selection and may reinforce species separation. However, while the genetic basis of many phenotypic differences have been identified, we still lack knowledge about the genes underlying evolutionary differences in male genital organs and organ size more generally. The claspers (surstyli) are periphallic structures that play an important role in copulation in insects. Here we show that natural variation in clasper size and bristle number between Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans is caused by evolutionary changes in tartan (trn), which encodes a transmembrane leucine-rich repeat domain protein that mediates cell-cell interactions and affinity differences. There are no fixed amino acid differences in trn between D. mauritiana and D. simulans but differences in the expression of this gene in developing genitalia suggest cis-regulatory changes in trn underlie the evolution of clasper morphology in these species. Finally, analysis of reciprocal hemizyotes that are genetically identical, except for which species the functional allele of trn is from, determined that the trn allele of D. mauritiana specifies larger claspers with more bristles than the allele of D. simulans. Therefore we have identified the first gene underlying evolutionary change in the size of a male genital organ, which will help to better understand the rapid diversification of these structures and the regulation and evolution of organ size more broadly.Significance StatementThe morphology of male genital organs evolves rapidly driven by sexual selection. However, little is known about the genes underlying genitalia differences between species. Identifying these genes is key to understanding how sexual selection acts on development to produce rapid phenotypic change. We have found that the gene tartan underlies differences between male Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans in the size and bristle number of the claspers - genital projections that grasp the female during copulation. Moreover, since tartan encodes a protein that is involved in cell affinity, this may represent a new developmental mechanism for morphological change. Therefore, our study provides new insights into genetic and developmental bases for the rapid evolution of male genitalia and organ size more generally.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"tartan underlies the evolution of male Drosophila genital morphology, bioRxiv, 2018-11-05","uri":"/reports/tartan_underlies_the_evolution_of_male_drosophila_genital_morphology_50816397/"},{"date":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractMost of the millions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome are non-coding, and many overlap with putative regulatory elements.

Here, we develop a computational strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate and compare single cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but different modalities as well. After demonstrating substantial improvement over existing methods for data integration, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq datasets to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets, and project single cell protein measurements onto a human bone marrow atlas to annotate and characterize lymphocyte populations.

However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology.

The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates.

Here, we modeled these perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and show that challenges to ribosome biogenesis result immediately in acute loss of proteostasis (protein folding homeostasis). Imbalances in the synthesis of r-proteins and rRNAs lead to the rapid aggregation of newly synthesized orphan r-proteins and compromise essential cellular processes. In response, proteostasis genes are activated by an Hsf1-dependent stress response pathway that is required for recovery from r-protein assembly stress. Importantly, we show that exogenously bolstering the proteostasis network increases cellular fitness in the face of challenges to ribosome assembly, demonstrating the direct contribution of orphan r-proteins to cellular phenotypes.

Moreover, our theory gives a precise account of how the ratio of midget to parasol cells decreases with retinal eccentricity. Also, we train a nonlinear encoding model with a rectifying nonlinearity to efficiently encode naturalistic movies, and again find emergent receptive fields resembling those of midget and parasol cells that are now further subdivided into ON and OFF types.

To compare the subcellular architecture of solitary collar cells in S. rosetta with that of multicellular “rosettes” and collar cells in sponges, we reconstructed entire cells in 3D through transmission electron microscopy on serial ultrathin sections. Structural analysis of our 3D reconstructions revealed important differences between single and colonial choanoflagellate cells, with colonial cells exhibiting a more amoeboid morphology consistent with relatively high levels of macropinocytotic activity. Comparison of multiple reconstructed rosette colonies highlighted the variable nature of cell sizes, cell-cell contact networks and colony arrangement. Importantly, we uncovered the presence of elongated cells in some rosette colonies that likely represent a distinct and differentiated cell type. Intercellular bridges within choanoflagellate colonies displayed a variety of morphologies and connected some, but not all, neighbouring cells. Reconstruction of sponge choanocytes revealed both ultrastructural commonalities and differences in comparison to choanoflagellates. Choanocytes and colonial choanoflagellates are typified by high amoeboid cell activity. In both, the number of microvilli and volumetric proportion of the Golgi apparatus are comparable, whereas choanocytes devote less of their cell volume to the nucleus and mitochondria than choanoflagellates and more of their volume to food vacuoles. Together, our comparative reconstructions uncover the architecture of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes and constitute an important step in reconstructing the cell biology of the last common ancestor of the animal kingdom.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"The architecture of cell differentiation in choanoflagellates and sponge choanocytes, bioRxiv, 2018-10-29","uri":"/reports/the_architecture_of_cell_differentiation_in_choanoflagellates_and_sponge_choanocytes_50443900/"},{"date":"2018-10-27T00:00:00Z","description":"SUMMARYWe introduce APEX-seq, a method for RNA sequencing based on spatial proximity to the peroxidase enzyme APEX2.

New genes can arise not only from mutations or rearrangements of existing sequences, but also via acquisition of foreign DNA, also called horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here we present evidence that HGT contributed to the creation of a novel gene indispensable for reproduction in some insects. The oskar gene evolved to fulfil a crucial role in insect germ cell formation, but was long considered a novel gene with unknown evolutionary origins. Our analysis of over 100 Oskar sequences suggests that Oskar arose through a novel gene formation history involving fusion of eukaryotic and prokaryotic sequences. One of its two conserved domains (LOTUS), was likely present in the genome of a last common insect ancestor, while the second (OSK) domain appears to have been acquired through horizontal transfer of a bacterial GDSL-like lipase domain. Our evidence suggests that the bacterial contributor of the OSK domain may have been a germ line endosymbiont. This shows that gene origin processes often considered highly unusual, including HGT and de novo coding region evolution, can give rise to novel genes that can both participate in pre-existing gene regulatory networks, and also facilitate the evolution of novel developmental mechanisms.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Bacterial contribution to genesis of the novel germ line determinant oskar, bioRxiv, 2018-10-26","uri":"/reports/bacterial_contribution_to_genesis_of_the_novel_germ_line_determinant_oskar_50270763/"},{"date":"2018-10-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDeveloping new software tools for analysis of large-scale biological data is a key component of advancing modern biomedical research.

The method—called Graph-aware Retrieval of Selective Sweeps (GRoSS)—has good power to detect loci in the genome with strong evidence for past selective sweeps and can also identify which branch of the graph was most affected by the sweep. As evidence of its utility, we apply the method to bovine, codfish and human population genomic data containing multiple population panels related in complex ways. We find new candidate genes for important adaptive functions, including immunity and metabolism in under-studied human populations, as well as muscle mass, milk production and tameness in specific bovine breeds.

The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches, 2 of which include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (+) RNA and double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (−) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from +RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas -RNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of +RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, particularly, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy.IMPORTANCEThe majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens.

A hallmark of this transition is the addition of multiple long bones to the proximal-distal axis of paired appendages. Whereas limb skeletons are often elaborate and diverse, teleost pectoral fins retain a simple endoskeleton. Fins and limbs share many core developmental processes, but how these programs were reshaped to produce limbs from fins during evolution remains enigmatic. Here we identify zebrafish mutants that form supernumerary long bones along the proximal-distal axis of pectoral fins with limb-like patterning. These new skeletal elements are integrated into the fin, as they are connected to the musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring bones. This phenotype is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage development, vav2 and waslb, which we show function in a common pathway. We find that this pathway functions in appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of Wasl in developing limbs results in patterning defects identical to those seen in Hoxall knockout mice. Concordantly, formation of supernumerary fin long bones requires the function of hoxall paralogs, indicating developmental homology with the forearm and the existence of a latent functional Hox code patterning the fin endoskeleton.

While population genetics views adaptation as a sequence of selective sweeps at single loci underlying the trait, quantitative genetics posits a collective response, where phenotypic adaptation results from subtle allele frequency shifts at many loci. Yet, a synthesis of these views is largely missing and the population genetic factors that favor each scenario are not well understood. Here, we study the architecture of adaptation of a binary polygenic trait (such as resistance) with negative epistasis among the loci of its basis. The genetic structure of this trait allows for a full range of potential architectures of adaptation, ranging from sweeps to small frequency shifts. By combining computer simulations and a newly devised analytical framework based on Yule branching processes, we gain a detailed understanding of the adaptation dynamics for this trait. Our key analytical result is an expression for the joint distribution of mutant alleles at the end of the adaptive phase. This distribution characterizes the polygenic pattern of adaptation at the underlying genotype when phenotypic adaptation has been accomplished. We find that a single compound parameter, the population-scaled background mutation rate Θbg, explains the main differences among these patterns. For a focal locus, Θbg measures the mutation rate at all redundant loci in its genetic background that offer alternative ways for adaptation. For adaptation starting from mutation-selection-drift balance, we observe different patterns in three parameter regions. Adaptation proceeds by sweeps for small Θbg ≲0.1, while small polygenic allele frequency shifts require large Θbg ≳100.

These genomes reveal complex patterns of past population admixture and replacement events throughout northeastern Siberia, with evidence for at least three large-scale human migrations into the region. The first inhabitants, a previously unknown population of “Ancient North Siberians” (ANS), represented by Yana RHS, diverged ~38 kya from Western Eurasians, soon after the latter split from East Asians. Between 20 and 11 kya, the ANS population was largely replaced by peoples with ancestry related to present-day East Asians, giving rise to ancestral Native Americans and “Ancient Paleosiberians” (AP), represented by a 9.8 kya skeleton from Kolyma River. AP are closely related to the Siberian ancestors of Native Americans, and ancestral to contemporary communities such as Koryaks and Itelmen. Paleoclimatic modelling shows evidence for a refuge during the last glacial maximum (LGM) in southeastern Beringia, suggesting Beringia as a possible location for the admixture forming both ancestral Native Americans and AP. Between 11 and 4 kya, AP were in turn largely replaced by another group of peoples with ancestry from East Asia, the “Neosiberians” from which many contemporary Siberians derive. We detect gene flow events in both directions across the Bering Strait during this time, influencing the genetic composition of Inuit, as well as Na Dene-speaking Northern Native Americans, whose Siberian-related ancestry components is closely related to AP. Our analyses reveal that the population history of northeastern Siberia was highly dynamic throughout the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. The pattern observed in northeastern Siberia, with earlier, once widespread populations being replaced by distinct peoples, seems to have taken place across northern Eurasia, as far west as Scandinavia.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"The population history of northeastern Siberia since the Pleistocene, bioRxiv, 2018-10-22","uri":"/reports/the_population_history_of_northeastern_siberia_since_the_pleistocene_50079518/"},{"date":"2018-10-19T00:00:00Z","description":"Archaea synthesize membranes of isoprenoid lipids that are ether-linked to glycerol, while BacteriaEukarya produce membranes consisting of ester-bound fatty acids.

Drosophila melanogaster instead relies on specialized retrotransposons that insert preferentially at telomeres. This exchange of goods between host and mobile element—wherein the mobile element provides an essential genome service and the host provides a hospitable niche for mobile element propagation—has been called a ‘genomic symbiosis’. However, these telomere-specialized, ‘jockey’ family elements may actually evolve to selfishly over-replicate in the genomes that they ostensibly serve. Under this intra-genomic conflict model, we expect rapid diversification of telomere-specialized retrotransposon lineages and possibly, the breakdown of this tenuous relationship. Here we report data consistent with both predictions. Searching the raw reads of the 15-million-year-old ‘melanogaster species group’, we generated de novo jockey retrotransposon consensus sequences and used phylogenetic tree-building to delineate four distinct telomere-associated lineages. Recurrent gains, losses, and replacements account for this striking retrotransposon lineage diversity. Moreover, an ancestrally telomere-specialized element has ‘escaped,’ residing now throughout the genome of D. rhopaloa. In D. biarmipes, telomere-specialized elements have disappeared completely. De novo assembly of long-reads and cytogenetics confirmed this species-specific collapse of retrotransposon-dependent telomere elongation. Instead, telomere-restricted satellite DNA and DNA transposon fragments occupy its terminal ends. We infer that D. biarmipes relies instead on a recombination-based mechanism conserved from yeast to flies to humans. Combined with previous reports of adaptive evolution at host proteins that regulate telomere length, telomere-associated retrotransposon diversification and disappearance offer compelling evidence that intra-genomic conflict shapes Drosophila telomere evolution.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Diversification and collapse of a telomere elongation mechanism, bioRxiv, 2018-10-18","uri":"/reports/diversification_and_collapse_of_a_telomere_elongation_mechanism_49862531/"},{"date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenome mining has become a key technology to explore and exploit natural product diversity through the identification and analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).

Furthermore, we identify that CALR mutations lead to NF-κB pathway upregulation specifically in uncommitted early stem cells.

First, using representational similarity analysis, we found that facial gender and age information emerged before identity information, suggesting a coarse-to-fine processing of face dimensions. Second, identity and gender representations of familiar faces were enhanced very early on, indicating that the previously-reported behavioral benefit for familiar faces results from tuning of early feed-forward processing mechanisms.

These associations have been proposed to reflect the lifelong consequences of an adverse intrauterine environment. In earlier work, we demonstrated that much of the negative correlation between BW and adult cardio-metabolic traits could instead be attributable to shared genetic effects. However, that work and other previous studies did not systematically distinguish the direct effects of an individual’s own genotype on BW and subsequent disease risk from indirect effects of their mother’s correlated genotype, mediated by the intrauterine environment. Here, we describe expanded genome-wide association analyses of own BW (n=321,223) and offspring BW (n=230,069 mothers), which identified 278 independent association signals influencing BW (214 novel). We used structural equation modelling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic influences on BW, implicating fetal- and maternal-specific mechanisms. We used Mendelian randomization to explore the causal relationships between factors influencing BW through fetal or maternal routes, for example, glycemic traits and blood pressure. Direct fetal genotype effects dominate the shared genetic contribution to the association between lower BW and higher type 2 diabetes risk, whereas the relationship between lower BW and higher later blood pressure (BP) is driven by a combination of indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects indirect effects of maternal BP-raising genotypes act to reduce offspring BW, but only direct fetal genotype effects (once inherited) increase the offspring’s later BP. Instrumental variable analysis using maternal BW-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring BP.

In Drosophila, homologous chromosomes pair throughout development, promoting an interchromosomal gene regulatory mechanism called transvection. Despite over a century of study, the molecular features that facilitate chromosome-wide pairing are unknown. The “button” model of pairing proposes that specific regions along chromosomes pair with a higher affinity than their surrounding regions, but only a handful of DNA elements that drive homologous pairing between chromosomes have been described. Here, we identify button loci interspersed across the fly genome that have the ability to pair with their homologous sequences. Buttons are characterized by topologically associated domains (TADs), which drive pairing with their endogenous loci from multiple locations in the genome. Fragments of TADs do not pair, suggesting a model in which combinations of elements interspersed along the full length of a TAD are required for pairing. Though DNA-binding insulator proteins are not associated with pairing, buttons are enriched for insulator cofactors, suggesting that these proteins may mediate higher order interactions between homologous TADs. Using a TAD spanning the spinelessd gene as a paradigm, we find that pairing is necessary but not sufficient for transvection. spineless pairing and transvection are cell-type-specific, suggesting that local buttoning and unbuttoning regulates transvection efficiency between cell types.

A subset of these variants, however, may have poor sequencing quality due to limitations in sequencing technology or in variant calling algorithms. In genetic studies that analyze a large number of sequenced individuals, it is critical to detect and remove those variants with poor quality as they may cause spurious findings. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for performing quality control on variants identified from NGS data by combining a traditional filtering approach and a machine learning approach. Our method uses information on sequencing quality such as sequencing depth, genotyping quality, and GC contents to predict whether a certain variant is likely to contain errors. To evaluate our method, we applied it to two whole-genome sequencing datasets where one dataset consists of related individuals from families while the other consists of unrelated individuals. Results indicate that our method outperforms widely used methods for performing quality control on variants such as VQSR of GATK by considerably improving the quality of variants to be included in the analysis. Our approach is also very efficient, and hence can be applied to large sequencing datasets. We conclude that combining a machine learning algorithm trained with sequencing quality information and the filtering approach is an effective approach to perform quality control on genetic variants from sequencing data.Author SummaryGenetic disorders can be caused by many types of genetic mutations, including common and rare single nucleotide variants, structural variants, insertions and deletions. Nowadays, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to identify various genetic variants that are associated with diseases. However, variants detected by NGS might have poor sequencing quality due to biases and errors in sequencing technologies and analysis tools. Therefore, it is critical to remove variants with low quality, which could cause spurious findings in follow-up analyses. Previously, people applied either hard filters or machine learning models for variant quality control (QC), which failed to filter out those variants accurately. Here, we developed a statistical tool, ForestQC, for variant QC by combining a filtering approach and a machine learning approach.

Programmed DNA elimination leads to dramatic changes in genome organisation during the germline-soma differentiation of ciliates, lampreys, nematodes, and various other eukaryotes. A particularly remarkable example of tissue-specific genome differentiation is the germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) in the zebra finch which is consistently absent from somatic cells. Although the zebra finch is an important animal model system, molecular evidence from its large GRC (\u0026gt;150 megabases) is limited to a short intergenic region and a single mRNA. Here, we combined cytogenetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic evidence to resolve the evolutionary origin and functional significance of the GRC. First, by generating tissue-specific de-novo linked-read genome assemblies and re-sequencing two additional germline and soma samples, we found that the GRC contains at least 115 genes which are paralogous to single-copy genes on 18 autosomes and the Z chromosome. We detected an amplification of 38 GRC-linked genes into high copy numbers (up to 308 copies) but, surprisingly, no enrichment of transposable elements on the GRC. Second, transcriptome and proteome data provided evidence for functional expression of GRC genes at the RNA and protein levels in testes and ovaries. Interestingly, the GRC is enriched for genes with highly expressed orthologs in chicken gonads and gene ontologies involved in female gonad development. Third, we detected evolutionary strata of GRC-linked genes. Genes such as bicc1 and trim71 have resided on the GRC for tens of millions of years, whereas dozens have become GRC-linked very recently. The GRC is thus likely widespread in songbirds (half of all bird species) and its rapid evolution may have contributed to their diversification. Together, our results demonstrate a highly dynamic evolutionary history of the songbird GRC leading to dramatic germline-soma genome differences as a novel mechanism to minimize genetic conflict between germline and soma.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Programmed DNA elimination of germline development genes in songbirds, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16","uri":"/reports/programmed_dna_elimination_of_germline_development_genes_in_songbirds_49787910/"},{"date":"2018-10-16T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTBackgroundIn recent years, research on cancer predisposition germline variants has emerged as a prominent field. The identity of somatic mutations is based on a reliable mapping of the patient germline variants. In addition, the statistics of germline variants frequencies in healthy individuals and cancer patients is the basis for seeking candidates for cancer predisposition genes. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the main sources of such data, providing a diverse collection of molecular data including deep sequencing for more than 30 types of cancer from \u0026gt;10,000 patients.MethodsOur hypothesis in this study is that whole exome sequences from healthy blood samples of cancer patients are not expected to show systematic differences among cancer types. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed common and rare germline variants across six cancer types, covering 2,241 samples from TCGA. In our analysis we accounted for inherent variables in the data including the different variant calling protocols, sequencing platforms, and ethnicity.ResultsWe report on substantial batch effects in germline variants associated with cancer types. We attribute the effect to the specific sequencing centers that produced the data. Specifically, we measured 30% variability in the number of reported germline variants per sample across sequencing centers. The batch effect is further expressed in nucleotide composition and variant frequencies. Importantly, the batch effect causes substantial differences in germline variant distribution patterns across numerous genes, including prominent cancer predisposition genes such as BRCA1, RET, MAX, and KRAS. For most of known cancer predisposition genes, we found a distinct batch-dependent difference in germline variants.ConclusionTCGA germline data is exposed to strong batch effects with substantial variabilities among TCGA sequencing centers. We claim that those batch effects are consequential for numerous TCGA pan-cancer studies. In particular, these effects may compromise the reliability and the potency to detect new cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, interpretation of pan-cancer analyses should be revisited in view of the source of the genomic data after accounting for the reported batch effects.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Substantial Batch Effects in TCGA Exome Sequences Undermine Pan-Cancer Analysis of Germline Variants, bioRxiv, 2018-10-16","uri":"/reports/substantial_batch_effects_in_tcga_exome_sequences_undermine_pan-cancer_analysis_of_germline_variants_49805511/"},{"date":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractDecoding the functional connectivity of the nervous system is facilitated by transgenic methods that express a genetically encoded reporter or effector in specific neurons; however, most transgenic lines show broad spatiotemporal and cell-type expression.

We examined scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic features also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture GC content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with lifespan. Among these were very long gene length, due to large introns highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like LINEs, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neurodegeneration genes. The whale shark’s genome had an expansion of gene families related to fatty acid metabolism and neurogenesis, with the slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date.

In this paper we propose a novel framework for understanding its function. Grid cells are neurons in the entorhinal cortex that represent the location of an animal in its environment. Recent evidence suggests that grid cell-like neurons may also be present in the neocortex. We propose that grid cells exist throughout the neocortex, in every region and in every cortical column. They define a location-based framework for how the neocortex functions. Whereas grid cells in the entorhinal cortex represent the location of one thing, the body relative to its environment, we propose that cortical grid cells simultaneously represent the location of many things. Cortical columns in somatosensory cortex track the location of tactile features relative to the object being touched and cortical columns in visual cortex track the location of visual features relative to the object being viewed. We propose that mechanisms in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus that evolved for learning the structure of environments are now used by the neocortex to learn the structure of objects. Having a representation of location in each cortical column suggests mechanisms for how the neocortex represents object compositionality and object behaviors. It leads to the hypothesis that every part of the neocortex learns complete models of objects and that there are many models of each object distributed throughout the neocortex. The similarity of circuitry observed in all cortical regions is strong evidence that even high-level cognitive tasks are learned and represented in a location-based framework.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"A Framework for Intelligence and Cortical Function Based on Grid Cells in the Neocortex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13","uri":"/reports/a_framework_for_intelligence_and_cortical_function_based_on_grid_cells_in_the_neocortex_49622119/"},{"date":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","description":"Centrosome positioning relative to the nucleus and cell shape is highly regulated across cell types, during cell migration and during spindle formation in cell division. Across most sexually reproducing animals, centrosomes are provided to the oocyte through fertilization and must be positioned properly to establish the zygotic mitotic spindle. How centrosomes are positioned in space and time through the concerted action of key mitotic entry biochemical regulators including Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A-B55SUR-6), biophysical regulators including Dynein and the nuclear lamina is unclear. Here, we uncover a role for PP2A-B55SUR-6 in regulating centrosome positioning. Mechanistically, PP2A-B55SUR-6 regulates nuclear size prior to mitotic entry, in turn affecting nuclear envelope-based Dynein density and motor capacity. Using computational simulations, PP2A-B55 SUR-6 regulation of nuclear size and nuclear envelope Dynein density were both predicted to be required for proper centrosome positioning. Conversely, compromising nuclear lamina integrity led to centrosome detachment from the nuclear envelope and migration defects. Removal of PP2A-B55SUR-6 and the nuclear lamina simultaneously further disrupted centrosome positioning, leading to unseparated centrosome pairs dissociated from the nuclear envelope. Taken together, we propose a model in which centrosomes migrate and are positioned through the concerted action of nuclear envelope-based Dynein pulling forces and cen-trosome-nuclear envelope tethering.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Centrosome-nuclear envelope tethering and microtubule motor-based pulling forces collaborate in centrosome positioning during mitotic entry, bioRxiv, 2018-10-13","uri":"/reports/centrosome-nuclear_envelope_tethering_and_microtubule_motor-based_pulling_forces_collaborate_in_centrosome_positioning_during_mitotic_entry_49606755/"},{"date":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractA central challenge in human genomics is to understand the cellular, evolutionary, and clinical significance of genetic variants.

Unlike phages that are released to and act in the extracellular medium, the T6SS is an intracellular machine inserted in the bacterial membranes by a trans-envelope complex. This membrane complex (MC) comprises three proteins TssJ, TssL and TssM. We previously reported the low-resolution negative stain electron microscopy structure of the enteroaggregative Escherichia coli MC and proposed a rotational 5-fold symmetry with a TssJTssLTssM stoichiometry of 222. Here, cryo-electron tomography analysis of the T6SS MC confirmed the 5-fold symmetry in situ and identified the regions of the structure that insert into the bacterial membranes. A high resolution model obtained by single particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals its global architecture and highlights new features five additional copies of TssJ, yielding a TssJTssLTssM stoichiometry of 322, a 11-residue loop in TssM, protruding inside the lumen of the MC and constituting a functionally important periplasmic gate, and hinge regions.

The core assumption underlying these approaches is that the mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency. Despite the importance of this assumption, it has not been rigorously tested.New methodWe introduce extensions of common approaches that are better suited for the physiological reality of how neural oscillations often manifest as nonstationary, high-power bursts, rather than sustained rhythms. Log-transforming, or taking the median power, significantly reduces erroneously inflated power estimates.ResultsAnalyzing 101 participants’ worth of human electrophysiology, totaling 3,560 channels and over 40 hours data, we show that, in all cases examined, spectral power is not Gaussian distributed. This is true even when oscillations are prominent and sustained, such as visual cortical alpha. Power across time, at every frequency, is characterized by a substantial long tail, which implies that estimates of average power are skewed toward large, infrequent high-power oscillatory bursts.Comparison with existing methodsIn a simulated event-related experiment we show how introducing just a few high-power oscillatory bursts, as seen in real data, can, perhaps erroneously, cause significant differences between conditions using traditional methods.

Meiotic patterns agree with simulations of loop extrusion limited by barriers, yet are patterned by convergent transcription rather than binding of the mammalian interphase factor, CTCF, which is absent in S. cerevisiae - thereby both challenging and extending current paradigms of local chromosome organisation. While grid-like interactions emerge independently of meiotic chromosome synapsis, synapsis itself generates additional compaction that matures differentially according to telomere proximity and chromosome size.

Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population variation (or population noise) and the correlation among characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate, especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals.

The estimates are also affected by the type of data analysed, with analyses of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the autocorrelated-rates model.

While they both show similar shared genetic liability with the personality trait neuroticism, a greater proportion of the genome contribute to the minimal phenotyping definitions of depression (80.2%, SE = 0.6%) than to strictly defined MDD (65.8%, SE = 0.6%). We find that GWAS loci identified in minimal phenotyping definitions of depression are not specific to MDD they also predispose to other psychiatric conditions. Finally, genetic predictors based on minimal phenotyping definitions are not predictive of strictly defined MDD in independent cohorts. Our results reveal that genetic analysis of minimal phenotyping definitions of depression identifies non-specific genetic factors shared between MDD and other psychiatric conditions. Reliance on results from minimal phenotyping for MDD may thus bias views of the genetic architecture of MDD and impedes ability to identify pathways specific to MDD.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Minimal phenotyping yields GWAS hits of low specificity for major depression, bioRxiv, 2018-10-11","uri":"/reports/minimal_phenotyping_yields_gwas_hits_of_low_specificity_for_major_depression_49533763/"},{"date":"2018-10-11T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractRealising the potential of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology for drug discovery, disease modelling and cell therapy requires an understanding of variability across iPSC lines.

For many TRs, however, these features are very difficult - if not impossible - to assess, requiring low-throughput and labor-intensive assays. One example is a VNTR in ABCA7 for which we recently discovered that expanded alleles strongly increase risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the potential of long-read whole genome sequencing to surmount these challenges, using the high-throughput PromethION platform from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. To overcome the limitations of conventional base calling and alignment, we developed an algorithm to study the TR size and sequence directly on raw PromethION current data.We report the long-read sequencing of multiple human genomes (n = 11) using only a single sequencing run and flow cell per individual. With the use of fresh DNA extractions, DNA shearing to approximately 20kb and size selection, we obtained an average output of 70 gigabases (Gb) per flow cell, corresponding to a 21x genome coverage, and a maximum yield of 98 Gb (30x genome coverage). All ABCA7 VNTR alleles, including expansions up to 10,000 bases, were spanned by long sequencing reads, validated by Southern blotting. Classical approaches of TR length estimation suffered from low accuracy, low precision, DNA strand effects andor inability to call pathogenic repeat expansions. In contrast, our novel NanoSatellite algorithm, which circumvents base calling by using dynamic time warping on raw PromethION current data, achieved more than 90% accuracy and high precision (5.6% relative standard deviation) of TR length estimation, and detected all clinically relevant repeat expansions. In addition, we identified alternative TR sequence motifs with high consistency, allowing determination of TR sequence and distinction of VNTR alleles with homozygous length.In conclusion, we validated the robustness of single-experiment whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, a prerequisite for application of long-read sequencing in the clinic. In addition, we outperformed Southern blotting, enabling improved characterization of the role of expanded ABCA7 VNTR alleles in Alzheimer’s disease, and opening new opportunities for TR research.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Accurate characterization of expanded tandem repeat length and sequence through whole genome long-read sequencing on PromethION, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09","uri":"/reports/accurate_characterization_of_expanded_tandem_repeat_length_and_sequence_through_whole_genome_long-read_sequencing_on_promethion_49422509/"},{"date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractUnderstanding hybrid incompatibilities is a fundamental pursuit in evolutionary genetics. In crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males, the interaction of at least three genes is necessary for hybrid male lethality Hmr mel, Lhr sim, and gfzf sim. All three hybrid incompatibility genes are chromatin associated factors. While HMR and LHR physically bind each other and function together in a single complex, the connection between either of these proteins and gfzf remains mysterious. Here, we investigate the allele specific chromatin binding patterns of gfzf. First, our cytological analyses show that there is little difference in protein localization of GFZF between the two species except at telomeric sequences. In particular, GFZF binds the telomeric retrotransposon repeat arrays, and the differential binding of GFZF at telomeres reflects the rapid changes in sequence composition at telomeres between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. Second, we investigate the patterns of GFZF and HMR co-localization and find that the two proteins do not normally co-localize in D. melanogaster. However, in inter-species hybrids, HMR shows extensive mis-localization to GFZF sites, and this altered localization requires the presence of gfzf sim. Third, we find by ChIP-Seq that over-expression of HMR and LHR within species is sufficient to cause HMR to mis-localize to GFZF binding sites, indicating that HMR has a natural low affinity for GFZF sites. Together, these studies provide the first insights into the different properties of gfzf between D. melanogaster and D. simulans as well as a molecular interaction between gfzf and Hmr in the form of altered protein localization.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Altered chromatin localization of hybrid lethality proteins in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09","uri":"/reports/altered_chromatin_localization_of_hybrid_lethality_proteins_in_drosophila_49389027/"},{"date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractObjectivesModern humans are thought to have interbred with Neanderthals in the Near East soon after modern humans dispersed out of Africa.

Furthermore, we find that introgressed SNPs have very similar allele frequencies in the Levant and southern Arabia, which indicates that Neanderthal introgression is similarly distributed in Levantine and southern Arabian genomes.DiscussionWe infer that the ancestors of contemporary Levantine and southern Arabian populations received Neanderthal introgression prior to separating from each other and that there has been extensive gene flow between these populations.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Analyses of Neanderthal introgression suggest that Levantine and southern Arabian populations have a shared population history, bioRxiv, 2018-10-09","uri":"/reports/analyses_of_neanderthal_introgression_suggest_that_levantine_and_southern_arabian_populations_have_a_shared_population_history_49389672/"},{"date":"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractRapid advances in single-cell assays have outpaced methods for analysis of those data types.

Most cells are infected by virions with defects such as amino-acid mutations, internal deletions, or failure to express a gene. We identify instances of each type of defect that increase the likelihood that a cell activates an innate-immune response. However, immune activation remains stochastic in cells infected by virions with these defects, and sometimes occurs even when a cell is infected by a virion that expresses unmutated copies of all genes.

Pol II passage is impaired by nucleosomes and requires elongation factors that help Pol II to efficiently overcome the nucleosomal barrier1-4. How the Pol II machinery transcribes through a nucleosome remains unclear because structural studies have been limited to Pol II elongation complexes formed on DNA templates lacking nucleosomes5. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of transcribing Pol II from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae engaged with a downstream nucleosome core particle (NCP) at an overall resolution of 4.4 Å with resolutions ranging from 4-6 Å in Pol II and 6-8 Å in the NCP. Pol II and the NCP adopt a defined orientation that could not be predicted from modelling. Pol II contacts DNA of the incoming NCP on both sides of the nucleosomal dyad with its domains ‘clamp head’ and ‘lobe’. Comparison of the Pol II-NCP structure to known structures of Pol II complexes reveals that the elongation factors TFIIS, DSIF, NELF, PAF1 complex, and SPT6 can be accommodated on the Pol II surface in the presence of the oriented nucleosome. Further structural comparisons show that the chromatin remodelling enzyme Chd1, which is also required for efficient Pol II passage6,7, could bind the oriented nucleosome with its motor domain. The DNA-binding region of Chd1 must however be released from DNA when Pol II approaches the nucleosome, and based on published data8,9 this is predicted to stimulate Chd1 activity and to facilitate Pol II passage. Our results provide a starting point for a mechanistic analysis of chromatin transcription.","tags":["biorxiv","biochemistry","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Structure of transcribing RNA polymerase II-nucleosome complex, bioRxiv, 2018-10-07","uri":"/reports/structure_of_transcribing_rna_polymerase_ii-nucleosome_complex_49346096/"},{"date":"2018-10-06T00:00:00Z","description":"Imaging changes in membrane potential using genetically encoded fluorescent voltage indicators (GEVIs) has great potential for monitoring neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution.

Prevailing models indicate that the high intrinsic stability of CENP-A nucleosomes maintains centromere identity indefinitely. Here, we demonstrate that CENP-A is not stable at centromeres, but is instead gradually and continuously incorporated in quiescent cells including G0-arrested tissue culture cells and prophase I-arrested oocytes. Quiescent CENP-A incorporation involves the canonical CENP-A deposition machinery, but displays distinct requirements from cell cycle-dependent deposition. We demonstrate that Plk1 is required specifically for G1 CENP-A deposition, whereas transcription promotes CENP-A incorporation in quiescent oocytes. Preventing CENP-A deposition during quiescence results in significantly reduced CENP-A levels and perturbs chromosome segregation following the resumption of cell division. In contrast to quiescent cells, terminally differentiated cells fail to maintain CENP-A levels. Our work reveals that quiescent cells actively maintain centromere identity providing an indicator of proliferative potential.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Quiescent cells actively replenish CENP-A nucleosomes to maintain centromere identity and proliferative potential, bioRxiv, 2018-10-02","uri":"/reports/quiescent_cells_actively_replenish_cenp-a_nucleosomes_to_maintain_centromere_identity_and_proliferative_potential_49147569/"},{"date":"2018-10-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe goal of human brain mapping has long been to delineate the functional subunits in the brain and elucidate the functional role of each of these brain regions.

Faithful DSB repair using the homologous chromosome is essential for fertility, yielding either non-crossovers, which are frequent but difficult to detect, or crossovers. In certain hybrid mice, high sequence divergence causes PRDM9 to bind each homologue at different sites, 'asymmetrically', and these mice exhibit meiotic failure and infertility, by unknown mechanisms. To investigate the impact of local sequence divergence on recombination, we intercrossed two mouse subspecies over five generations and deep-sequenced 119 offspring, whose high heterozygosity allowed detection of thousands of crossover and non-crossover events with unprecedented power and spatial resolution. Both crossovers and non-crossovers are strongly depleted at individual asymmetric sites, revealing that PRDM9 not only positions DSBs but also promotes their homologous repair by binding to the unbroken homologue at each site. Unexpectedly, we found that non-crossovers containing multiple mismatches repair by a different mechanism than single-mismatch sites, which undergo GC-biased gene conversion. These results demonstrate that local genetic diversity profoundly alters meiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9-related hybrid infertility.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"A high-resolution map of non-crossover events reveals impacts of genetic diversity on mammalian meiotic recombination, bioRxiv, 2018-09-27","uri":"/reports/a_high-resolution_map_of_non-crossover_events_reveals_impacts_of_genetic_diversity_on_mammalian_meiotic_recombination_48950595/"},{"date":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe MPEG-G standardization initiative is a coordinated international effort to specify a compressed data format that enables large scale genomic data to be processed, transported and shared.

Such decoding process enables the use of leading-edge com-pression technologies that have exhibited significant compression gains over currently used formats for storage of unaligned and aligned sequencing reads. Additionally, the standard provides a wealth of much needed functionality, such as selective access, data aggregation, ap-plication programming interfaces to the compressed data, standard interfaces to support data protection mechanisms, support for streaming and a procedure to assess the conformance of implementations. ISOIEC is engaged in supporting the maintenance and availability of the standard specification, which guarantees the perenniality of applications using MPEG-G.

As the standard only specifies the decoding process, encoding performance, both in terms of speed and compression ratio, can vary depending on specific encoder implementations, and will likely improve during the lifetime of MPEG-G.

Here, akin to a chain reaction, we present the discovery of hydrodynamic trigger waves in cellular communities of the protist Spirostomum ambiguum, propagating hundreds of times faster than the swimming speed. Coiling its cytoskeleton, Spirostomum can contract its long body by 50% within milliseconds, with accelerations reaching 14g-forces. Surprisingly, a single cellular contraction (transmitter) is shown to generate long-ranged vortex flows at intermedi- ate Reynolds numbers, which can trigger neighbouring cells, in turn. To measure the sensitivity to hydrodynamic signals (receiver), we further present a high-throughput suction-flow device to probe mechanosensitive ion channel gating by back-calculating the microscopic forces on the cell mem- brane. These ultra-fast hydrodynamic trigger waves are analysed and modelled quantitatively in a universal framework of antenna and percolation theory. A phase transition is revealed, requiring a critical colony density to sustain collective communication. Our results suggest that this signalling could help organise cohabiting communities over large distances, influencing long-term behaviour through gene expression, comparable to quorum sensing. More immediately, as contractions release toxins, synchronised discharges could also facilitate the repulsion of large predators, or conversely immobilise large prey.

Whereas the generation of deletion or missense mutants is quite straightforward, the production of endogenous fluorescent reporters is still inefficient. The use of plasmids with selection markers is an effective methodology, but often requires laborious and complicated cloning steps. We have established a cloning-free ribonucleoprotein-driven Nested CRISPR method that robustly produces endogenous fluorescent reporters. This methodology is based on the division of the GFP and mCherry sequences in three fragments. In the first step we use ssDNA donors (≤200 bp) to insert 5’ and 3’ fragments in the place of interest. In the second step, we use these sequences as homology regions for Homology Directed Repair (HDR) with a dsDNA donor (PCR product, ≈700 bp) including the middle fragment, thus completing the fluorescent protein sequence. This method is advantageous because the first step with ssDNA donors is known to be very efficient, and the second step, uses universal reagents, including validated PCR products and crRNAs, to create fluorescent reporters reaching reliable editing efficiencies as high as 40%. We have also used Nested CRISPR in a non-essential gene to produce a deletion mutant in the first step and a transcriptional reporter in the second step.In the search of modifications to optimize the method, we tested synthetic sgRNAs, but we did not observe a significant increase in the efficacy compared to independently adding tracrRNA and crRNA to the injection mix. Conveniently, we also found that both steps of Nested CRISPR could be performed in a single injection. Finally, we discuss the utility of Nested CRISPR for targeted insertion of long DNA fragments in other systems and prospects of this method in the future.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Efficient generation of endogenous fluorescent reporters by Nested CRISPR in Caenorhabditis elegans, bioRxiv, 2018-09-26","uri":"/reports/efficient_generation_of_endogenous_fluorescent_reporters_by_nested_crispr_in_caenorhabditis_elegans_48920754/"},{"date":"2018-09-26T00:00:00Z","description":"Genomic data encodes past evolutionary events and has the potential to reveal the strength, rate, and biological drivers of adaptation.

We develop a novel MK-based method (ABC-MK) to infer adaptation rate and strength, and estimate alpha=0.135 in human protein-coding sequences, 72% of which is contributed by weakly adaptive variants. We show that in this adaptation regime alpha is reduced approx. 25% by linkage genome-wide.

This estimate is much higher than previous estimates, which did not account for the population size of the outgroup species. Next, we directly estimate the proportion and selection coefficients of newly arising strongly beneficial nonsynonymous mutations in humans, mice, and D. melanogaster by examining patterns of polymorphism and divergence. We develop a novel composite likelihood framework to test whether these parameters differ across species. Overall, we reject a model with the same proportion and the same selection coefficients of beneficial mutations across species, and estimate that humans have a higher proportion of beneficial mutations compared to Drosophila and mice. We demonstrate that this result cannot be attributed to biased gene conversion.

Here we present the first global analysis of language diversity that identifies the relative importance of two key ecological mechanisms suggested to promote language diversification - isolation and ecological risk - after correcting for spatial autocorrelation and phylogenetic non-independence. We find significant effects of climate on language diversity consistent with the ecological risk hypothesis that areas of high year-round productivity lead to more languages by supporting human cultural groups with smaller distributions. Climate has a much stronger effect on language diversity than landscape features that might contribute to isolation of cultural groups, such as altitudinal variation, river density, or landscape roughness. The association between biodiversity and language diversity appears to be an incidental effect of their covariation with climate, rather than a causal link between the two. While climate and landscape provide strong explanatory signal for variation in language diversity, we identify a number of areas of high unexplained language diversity, with more languages than would be predicted from environmental features alone; notably New Guinea, the Himalayan foothills, West Africa, and Mesoamerica.

Capitalizing on both quantitative and molecular genetic data, we perform the first genetically sensitive investigation of university success with a UK-representative sample of 3,000 genotyped individuals and 3,000 twin pairs. Twin analyses indicate substantial additive genetic influence on university entrance exam achievement (57%), university enrolment (51%), university quality (57%) and university achievement (46%). We find that environmental effects tend to be non-shared, although the shared environment is substantial for university enrolment. Furthermore, using multivariate twin analysis, we show moderate to high genetic correlations between university success variables (0.27–0.76). Analyses using DNA alone also support genetic influence on university success. Indeed, a genome-wide polygenic score, derived from a 2016 genome-wide association study of years of education, predicts up to 5% of the variance in each university success variable.

Instead, it has become clear that a huge number of common variants, each with tiny effects, explain most of the heritability. Previously, we argued that these patterns conﬂict with standard conceptual models, and that new models are needed. Here we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits can be partitioned into direct effects from core genes, and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting as trans-regulators. We argue that the central importance of peripheral genes is a direct consequence of the large contribution of trans-acting variation to gene expression variation. In particular, we propose that if the core genes for a trait are co-regulated – as seems likely – then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified by these co-regulated networks such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by peripheral genes. Thus our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Trans effects on gene expression can drive omnigenic inheritance, bioRxiv, 2018-09-25","uri":"/reports/trans_effects_on_gene_expression_can_drive_omnigenic_inheritance_48842970/"},{"date":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","description":"Tradeoffs affect resource allocation during development and result in fitness consequences that drive the evolution of life history strategies. Yet despite their importance, we know little about the mechanisms underlying life history tradeoffs in wild populations.

Due to this reallocation, a wing color polymorphism is associated with the ALHS individuals have either yelloworange or white wings. Here we map the genetic basis of the ALHS switch in Colias crocea to a transposable element insertion downstream of the Colias homolog of BarH-1, a homeobox transcription factor. Using CRISPRCas9 gene editing, antibody staining, and electron microscopy we find morph-specific specific expression of BarH-1 suppresses the formation of pigment granules in wing scales. Lipid and transcriptome analyses reveal physiological differences associated with the ALHS. These findings characterize a novel mechanism for a female-limited ALHS and show that the switch arises via recruitment of a transcription factor previously known for its function in cell fate determination in pigment cells of the retina.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"A transposable element insertion is the switch between alternative life history strategies, bioRxiv, 2018-09-24","uri":"/reports/a_transposable_element_insertion_is_the_switch_between_alternative_life_history_strategies_48826894/"},{"date":"2018-09-24T00:00:00Z","description":"Working memory involves a series of functions encoding a stimulus, maintaining or manipulating its representation over a delay, and finally making a behavioral response.

In vivo methods for interrogating organellar metabolites in specific cell-types within mammalian tissues have been limited. To address this, we built on prior work in which we exploited a mitochondrially-localized 3XHA epitope-tag (“MITO-Tag”) for the fast isolation of mitochondria from cultured cells to now generate “MITO-Tag Mice.” Affording spatiotemporal control over MITO-Tag expression, these transgenic animals enable the rapid, cell-type-specific immunoisolation of mitochondria from tissues, which we verified using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic approaches. Using MITO-Tag Mice and targeted and untargeted metabolite profiling, we identified changes during fasted and refed conditions in a diverse array of mitochondrial metabolites in hepatocytes and found metabolites that behaved differently at the mitochondrial versus whole-tissue level.

Theory predicts that the evolution of giants should be constrained by two tradeoffs. First, because body size is negatively correlated with population size, purifying selection is expected to be less efficient in species of large body size, leading to a genome-wide elevation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dNdS) or mutation load. Second, gigantism is achieved through higher number of cells and higher rates of cell proliferation, thus increasing the likelihood of cancer. However, the incidence of cancer in gigantic animals is lower than the theoretical expectation, a phenomenon referred to as Peto’s Paradox. To explore the genetic basis of gigantism in rodents and uncover genomic signatures of gigantism-related tradeoffs, we sequenced the genome of the capybara, the world’s largest living rodent. We found that dNdS is elevated genome wide in the capybara, relative to other rodents, implying a higher mutation load. Conversely, a genome-wide scan for adaptive protein evolution in the capybara highlighted several genes involved in growth regulation by the insulininsulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Capybara-specific gene-family expansions included a putative novel anticancer adaptation that involves T cell-mediated tumor suppression, offering a potential resolution to Peto’s Paradox in this lineage. Gene interaction network analyses also revealed that size regulators function simultaneously as growth factors and oncogenes, creating an evolutionary conflict. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that gigantism in the capybara likely involved three evolutionary steps 1) Increase in body size by cell proliferation through the ISS pathway, 2) coupled evolution of growth-regulatory and cancer-suppression mechanisms, possibly driven by intragenomic conflict, and 3) establishment of the T cell-mediated tumor suppression pathway as an anticancer adaptation. Interestingly, increased mutation load appears to be an inevitable outcome of an increase in body size.Author SummaryThe existence of gigantic animals presents an evolutionary puzzle. Larger animals have more cells and undergo exponentially more cell divisions, thus, they should have enormous rates of cancer. Moreover, large animals also have smaller populations making them vulnerable to extinction. So, how do gigantic animals such as elephants and blue whales protect themselves from cancer, and what are the consequences of evolving a large size on the ‘genetic health’ of a species? To address these questions we sequenced the genome of the capybara, the world’s largest rodent, and performed comparative genomic analyses to identify the genes and pathways involved in growth regulation and cancer suppression. We found that the insulin-signaling pathway was involved in the evolution of gigantism in the capybara. We also found a putative novel anticancer mechanism mediated by the detection of tumors by T-cells, offering a potential solution to how capybaras mitigated the tradeoff imposed by cancer. Furthermore, we show that capybara genome harbors a higher proportion of slightly deleterious mutations relative to all other rodent genomes. Overall, this study provides insights at the genomic level into the evolution of a complex and extreme phenotype, and offers a detailed picture of how the evolution of a giant body size in the capybara has shaped its genome.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"How to make a rodent giant Genomic basis and tradeoffs of gigantism in the capybara, the world’s largest rodent, bioRxiv, 2018-09-23","uri":"/reports/how_to_make_a_rodent_giant_genomic_basis_and_tradeoffs_of_gigantism_in_the_capybara_the_worlds_largest_rodent_48807334/"},{"date":"2018-09-23T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractHere we present Parliament2 – a structural variant caller which combines multiple best-in-class structural variant callers to create a highly accurate callset.

A number of different Cas (CRISPR-associated) nucleases are now used but, as most studies performed to date have engineered different targets using a variety of plant species and molecular tools, it has been difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative performance of different nucleases. Due to the time and effort required to regenerate engineered plants, efficiency is critical. In addition, there have been several reports of mutations at sequences with less than perfect identity to the target. While in some plant species it is possible to remove these so-called ‘off-targets’ by backcrossing to a parental line, the specificity of genome engineering tools is important when targeting specific members of closely-related gene families, especially when recent paralogues are co-located in the genome and unlikely to segregate. Specificity is also important for species that take years to reach sexual maturity or that are clonally propagated. Here, we directly compare the efficiency and specificity of Cas nucleases from different bacterial species together with engineered variants of Cas9. We find that the nucleotide content correlates with efficiency and that Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus is comparatively most efficient at inducing mutations. We also demonstrate that ‘high-fidelity’ variants of Cas9 can reduce off-target mutations in plants.

These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the tissue undergoing gastrulation movements is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4,5. While it is well recognized that gastrulation movements depend on forces generated by tissue-intrinsic contractility6,7, it is not known if interactions between the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces that impact gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to the vitelline envelope surrounding the embryo. This attachment generates an additional force that counteracts the tissue-intrinsic contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. Furthermore, this localized attachment is mediated by a specific integrin, and its knock-down leads to a gastrulation phenotype consistent with complete loss of attachment. Moreover, analysis of another integrin in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster suggests that gastrulation in this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and the vitelline. Together, our findings reveal a conserved mechanism whereby the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to the vitelline envelope provides controllable counter-forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Integrin-mediated attachment of the blastoderm to the vitelline envelope impacts gastrulation of insects, bioRxiv, 2018-09-19","uri":"/reports/integrin-mediated_attachment_of_the_blastoderm_to_the_vitelline_envelope_impacts_gastrulation_of_insects_48653929/"},{"date":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","description":"Complex traits and common disease are highly polygenic thousands of common variants are causal, and their effect sizes are almost always small. Polygenicity could be explained by negative selection, which constrains common-variant effect sizes and may reshape their distribution across the genome. We refer to this phenomenon as flattening, as genetic signal is flattened relative to the underlying biology. We introduce a mathematical definition of polygenicity, the effective number of associated SNPs, and a robust statistical method to estimate it. This definition of polygenicity differs from the number of causal SNPs, a standard definition; it depends strongly on SNPs with large effects. In analyses of 33 complex traits (average N=361k), we determined that common variants are ∼4x more polygenic than low-frequency variants, consistent with pervasive flattening. Moreover, functionally important regions of the genome have increased polygenicity in proportion to their increased heritability, implying that heritability enrichment reflects differences in the number of associations rather than their magnitude (which is constrained by selection). We conclude that negative selection constrains the genetic signal of biologically important regions and genes, reshaping genetic architecture.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Polygenicity of complex traits is explained by negative selection, bioRxiv, 2018-09-19","uri":"/reports/polygenicity_of_complex_traits_is_explained_by_negative_selection_48597655/"},{"date":"2018-09-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractHere, we describe the third major release of relion.

Although widely observed across the brain,7-10 such variability is not well understood, and could reflect noise or structure, such as the encoding of additional cognitive information.6,11-13 Here, we introduce a conceptual model to explain variability in terms of underlying, population-level structure in single-trial neural activity. To test this model, we developed a novel unsupervised learning algorithm incorporating temporal dynamics, in order to characterize population activity as a trajectory on a nonlinear manifold—a space of possible network states. The manifold’s structure captures correlations between neurons and temporal relationships between states, constraints arising from underlying network architecture and inputs. Using measurements of activity over time but no information about exogenous behavioral variables, we recovered hippocampal activity manifolds during spatial and non-spatial cognitive tasks in rats. Manifolds were low-dimensional and smoothly encoded task-related variables, but contained an extra dimension reflecting information beyond the measured behavioral variables. Consistent with our model, neurons fired as a function of overall network state, and fluctuations in their activity across trials corresponded to variation in the underlying trajectory on the manifold. In particular, the extra dimension allowed the system to take different trajectories despite repeated behavioral conditions. Furthermore, the trajectory could temporarily decouple from current behavioral conditions and traverse neighboring manifold points corresponding to past, future, or nearby behavioral states. Our results suggest that trial-to-trial variability in the hippocampus is structured, and may reflect the operation of internal cognitive processes. The manifold structure of population activity is well-suited for organizing information to support memory,1,5,14 planning,12,15,16 and reinforcement learning.17,18 In general, our approach could find broader use in probing the organization and computational role of circuit dynamics in other brain regions.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Probing variability in a cognitive map using manifold inference from neural dynamics, bioRxiv, 2018-09-17","uri":"/reports/probing_variability_in_a_cognitive_map_using_manifold_inference_from_neural_dynamics_48504340/"},{"date":"2018-09-17T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryAfter we listen to a series of words, we can silently replay them in our mind.

We compared the phenotypic concordance between spouses for self-reported alcohol use with the association between an individual’s self-reported alcohol use and their partner’s rs1229984 genotype using Mendelian randomization. This was followed up by an exploration of the spousal genotypic concordance for the variant and an analysis determining if relationship length may be related to spousal alcohol behaviour similarities.We found strong evidence that both an individual’s self-reported alcohol consumption and rs1229984 genotype are associated with their partner’s self-reported alcohol use. The Mendelian randomization analysis found that each unit increase in an individual’s weekly alcohol consumption increased their partner’s alcohol consumption by 0.26 units (95% C.I. 0.15, 0.38; P=1.10×10-5). Furthermore, the rs1229984 genotype was concordant within spouse-pairs, suggesting that some spousal concordance for alcohol consumption existed prior to cohabitation.

Remarkably, some bacteria have exploited the destructive properties of phage genes for their own benefit by co-opting them as toxins for functions related to bacterial warfare, virulence, and secretion. However, do toxic phage genes ever become raw material for functional innovation? Here we report on a toxic phage gene whose product has lost its toxicity and has become a domain of a core cellular factor, SpmX, throughout the bacterial order Caulobacterales. Using a combination of phylogenetics, bioinformatics, structural biology, cell biology, and biochemistry, we have investigated the origin and function of SpmX and determined that its occurrence is the result of the detoxification of a phage peptidoglycan hydrolase gene. We show that the retained, attenuated activity of the phage-derived domain plays an important role in proper cell morphology and developmental regulation in representatives of this large bacterial clade.

These subtypes were predictive of treatment response to transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.ObjectiveHere, we attempted to replicate the procedure followed in the Drysdale et al. study and their findings in an independent dataset of a clinically more heterogeneous sample of 187 participants with depression and anxiety. We aimed to answer the following questions 1) Using the same procedure, can we find a statistically significant and reliable relationship between brain connectivity and clinical symptoms? 2) Is the observed relationship similar to the one found in the original study? 3) Can we identify distinct and reliable subtypes? 4) Do they have similar clinical profiles as the subtypes identified in the original study?MethodsWe followed the original procedure as closely as possible, including a canonical correlation analysis to find a low dimensional representation of clinically relevant resting state fMRI features, followed by hierarchical clustering to identify subtypes. We extended the original procedure using additional statistical tests, to test the statistical significance of the relationship between resting state fMRI and clinical data, and the existence of distinct subtypes.

The reconstruction of the species tree from molecular data is hindered by frequent conflicts between gene genealogies. A standard way of dealing with this issue is to postulate the existence of a unique species tree where disagreements between gene trees are explained by incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) due to random coalescences of gene lineages inside the edges of the species tree. This paradigm, known as the multi-species coalescent (MSC), is constantly violated by the ubiquitous presence of gene flow revealed by empirical studies, leading to topological incongruences of gene trees that cannot be explained by ILS alone. Here we argue that this paradigm should be revised in favor of a vision acknowledging the importance of gene flow and where gene histories shape the species tree rather than the opposite. We propose a new, plastic framework for modeling the joint evolution of gene and species lineages relaxing the hierarchy between the species tree and gene trees. We implement this framework in two mathematical models called the gene-based diversification models (GBD) 1) GBD-forward, following all evolving genomes and thus very intensive computationally and 2) GBD-backward, based on coalescent theory and thus more efficient. Each model features four parameters tuning colonization, mutation, gene flow and reproductive isolation. We propose a quick inference method based on the differences between gene trees and use it to evaluate the amount of gene flow in two empirical data-sets. We find that in these data-sets, gene tree distributions are better explained by the best fitting GBD model than by the best fitting MSC model.

However, some pathogen strains invoke immune responses that provide partial cross-immunity against infection with related strains. Here, we consider a mathematical model of successive outbreaks of two strains a low virulence strain outbreak followed by a high virulence strain outbreak. Under these circumstances, we investigate the impacts of varying travel rates and cross-immunity on the probability that a major epidemic of the high virulence strain occurs, and the size of that outbreak. Frequent travel between subpopulations can lead to widespread immunity to the high virulence strain, driven by exposure to the low virulence strain. As a result, major epidemics of the high virulence strain are less likely, and can potentially be smaller, with more connected subpopulations. Cross-immunity may be a factor contributing to the absence of a global pandemic as severe as the 1918 influenza pandemic in the century since.","tags":["biorxiv","epidemiology","500+-users","2018"],"title":"Increased frequency of travel in the presence of cross-immunity may act to decrease the chance of a global pandemic, bioRxiv, 2018-08-31","uri":"/reports/increased_frequency_of_travel_in_the_presence_of_cross-immunity_may_act_to_decrease_the_chance_of_a_global_pandemic_47444563/"},{"date":"2018-08-31T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has considerably facilitated the generation of mouse knockout alleles, relieving many of the cumbersome and time-consuming steps of traditional mouse embryonic stem cell technology. However, the generation of conditional knockout alleles remains an important challenge. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout alleles in mice using 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides (ssODN) (2sgRNA-2ssODN). We re-evaluated this method from a large data set generated from a consortium consisting of 17 transgenic core facilities or laboratories or programs across the world. The dataset constituted 17,887 microinjected or electroporated zygotes and 1,718 live born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice harbored 2 correct LoxP insertions in cis configuration indicating a very low efficiency of the method. To determine the factors required to successfully generate conditional alleles using the 2sgRNA-2ssODN approach, we performed a generalized linear regression model. We show that factors such as the concentration of the sgRNA, Cas9 protein or the distance between the placement of LoxP insertions were not predictive for the success of this technique. The major predictor affecting the method’s success was the probability of simultaneously inserting intact proximal and distal LoxP sequences, without the loss of the DNA segment between the two sgRNA cleavage sites. Our analysis of a large data set indicates that the 2sgRNA–2ssODN method generates a large number of undesired alleles (\u0026gt;99%), and a very small number of desired alleles (\u0026lt;1%) requiring, on average 1,192 zygotes.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Re-Evaluating One-step Generation of Mice Carrying Conditional Alleles by CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing Technology, bioRxiv, 2018-08-31","uri":"/reports/re-evaluating_one-step_generation_of_mice_carrying_conditional_alleles_by_crispr-cas9-mediated_genome_editing_technology_47288281/"},{"date":"2018-08-29T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe robustness of scholarly peer review has been challenged by evidence of disparities in publication outcomes based on author gender and nationality. To address this, we examined the peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors in determining the outcome of peer review; that is, gatekeepers favored manuscripts from authors of the same gender and from the same country. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was higher than for female last authors, and this gender inequity was greatest when the team of reviewers was all male; mixed-gender gatekeeper teams lead to more equitable peer review outcomes. Homogeny between the country affiliation of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author also lend to improved acceptance rates for many countries.

However, the integrity of peer review has been called into question based on evidence that outcomes often differ between between male and female authors, and for authors in different countries. We investigated such a disparity at the biosciences journal eLife by analyzing the demographics of authors and gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers), and peer review outcomes of all submissions between 2012 and 2017. We found evidence of disparity in outcomes that favored women and those affiliated within North America and Europe, and that these groups were over-represented among authors and gatekeepers. The gender disparity was greatest when reviewers were all male; mixed-gender reviewer teams lead to more equitable outcomes. Similarly, for some countries manuscripts were more likely to be accepted when reviewed by a gatekeeper from the same country as the author. Our results indicate that author and gatekeeper characteristics are associated with the outcomes of scientific peer review.

Conversely, in cancer and autism patients, we observed an enrichment of penetrance increasing haplotype configurations for pathogenic variants in disease-implicated genes, providing evidence that regulatory haplotype configuration of coding variants affects disease risk. Finally, we experimentally validated this model by editing a Mendelian single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) using CRISPRCas9 on distinct expression haplotypes with the transcriptome as a phenotypic readout.

These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional scRNA-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders (VAE), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by VAEs have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple VAE approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated scRNA-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for scRNA-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – PCA, ZIFA, UMAP and t-SNE. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for scRNA-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","0-100-users","2018"],"title":"Parameter tuning is a key part of dimensionality reduction via deep variational autoencoders for single cell RNA transcriptomics, bioRxiv, 2018-08-06","uri":"/reports/parameter_tuning_is_a_key_part_of_dimensionality_reduction_via_deep_variational_autoencoders_for_single_cell_rna_transcriptomics_46095947/"},{"date":"2018-08-03T00:00:00Z","description":"Large-scale genetic screens play a key role in the systematic discovery of genes underlying cellular phenotypes.

Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that “sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.” Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median’s bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation.

The limitations of NHST have been extensively discussed, with a broad consensus that current statistical practice in the biological sciences needs reform. However, there is less agreement on reform’s specific nature, with vigorous debate surrounding what would constitute a suitable alternative (Altman et al., 2000; Benjamin et al., 2017; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). An emerging view is that a more complete analytic technique would use statistical graphics to estimate effect sizes and evaluate their uncertainty (Cohen, 1994; Cumming and Calin-Jageman, 2016). As these estimation methods require only minimal statistical retraining, they have great potential to shift the current data-analysis culture away from dichotomous thinking towards quantitative reasoning (Claridge-Chang and Assam, 2016). The evolution of statistics has been inextricably linked to the development of quantitative displays that support complex visual reasoning (Tufte, 2001). We consider that the graphic we describe here as estimation plot is the most intuitive way to display the complete statistical information about experimental data sets. However, a major obstacle to adopting estimation plots is accessibility to suitable software. To lower this hurdle, we have developed free software that makes high-quality estimation plotting available to all.

The conclusions are supported by cell-autonomous studies in the offspring that demonstrate an enhanced capacity to form mature active brown adipocytes, improved neuronal density and more norepinephrine release in BAT in response to cold stimulation. Taken together, our results indicate that in humans and in mice, seasonal or experimental CE induces an epigenetic programming of the sperm such that the offspring harbor hyperactive BAT and an improved adaptation to overnutrition and hypothermia.","tags":["nature medicine","genetics","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Cold-induced epigenetic programming of the sperm enhances brown adipose tissue activity in the offspring, Nature Medicine, 2018-07-06","uri":"/reports/cold-induced_epigenetic_programming_of_the_sperm_enhances_brown_adipose_tissue_activity_in_the_offspring_44730679/"},{"date":"2018-07-04T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTWith the widespread uptake of 2D and 3D single molecule localization microscopy, a large set of different data analysis packages have been developed to generate super-resolution images.

We used linear regression analyses and likelihood ratio tests to calculate the association between SIDS and the stressors. SIDS prevalence was significantly and positively correlated with MNC and prematurity rates. MNC explained 14.2% of the variability of SIDS’s male bias in the US, reminiscent of the Jewish myth of Lilith, the killer of infant males. Combined, the stressors increased the likelihood of SIDS. Ecological analyses are useful to generate hypotheses but cannot provide strong evidence of causality.

To address this gap, we generated genome-wide data from 362 ancient individuals, including the first from eastern Iran, Turan (Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan), Bronze Age Kazakhstan, and South Asia. Our data reveal a complex set of genetic sources that ultimately combined to form the ancestry of South Asians today. We document a southward spread of genetic ancestry from the Eurasian Steppe, correlating with the archaeologically known expansion of pastoralist sites from the Steppe to Turan in the Middle Bronze Age (2300-1500 BCE). These Steppe communities mixed genetically with peoples of the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) whom they encountered in Turan (primarily descendants of earlier agriculturalists of Iran), but there is no evidence that the main BMAC population contributed genetically to later South Asians. Instead, Steppe communities integrated farther south throughout the 2nd millennium BCE, and we show that they mixed with a more southern population that we document at multiple sites as outlier individuals exhibiting a distinctive mixture of ancestry related to Iranian agriculturalists and South Asian hunter-gathers. We call this group Indus Periphery because they were found at sites in cultural contact with the Indus Valley Civilization (IVC) and along its northern fringe, and also because they were genetically similar to post-IVC groups in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. By co-analyzing ancient DNA and genomic data from diverse present-day South Asians, we show that Indus Periphery-related people are the single most important source of ancestry in South Asia—consistent with the idea that the Indus Periphery individuals are providing us with the first direct look at the ancestry of peoples of the IVC—and we develop a model for the formation of present-day South Asians in terms of the temporally and geographically proximate sources of Indus Periphery-related, Steppe, and local South Asian hunter-gatherer-related ancestry.

The DTI parameters were generated using the ENIGMA-DTI pipeline. We found that DTI parameters are substantially heritable on most WM tracts. We observed a highly polygenic or omnigenic architecture of genetic influence across the genome as well as the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Our bivariate analyses showed strong genetic correlations for several pairs of WM tracts as well as pairs of DTI parameters. We performed voxel-based analysis to illustrate the pattern of genetic effects on selected parts of the tract-based spatial statistics skeleton.

We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000 - 0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software.

Analyzing our single-cell transcriptomic maps of human and mouse spermatogenesis, we provide evidence that this widespread transcription serves to maintain DNA sequence integrity in the male germline by correcting DNA damage through 'transcriptional scanning'. Supporting this model, we find that genes expressed during spermatogenesis display lower mutation rates on the transcribed strand and have low diversity in the population. Moreover, this effect is fine-tuned by the level of gene expression during spermatogenesis. The unexpressed genes, which in our model do not benefit from transcriptional scanning, diverge faster over evolutionary time-scales and are enriched for sensory and immune-defense functions. Collectively, we propose that transcriptional scanning modulates germline mutation rates in a gene-specific manner, maintaining DNA sequence integrity for the bulk of genes but allowing for fast evolution in a specific subset.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","200-500-users","2018"],"title":"Widespread transcriptional scanning in the testis modulates gene evolution rates, bioRxiv, 2018-03-14","uri":"/reports/widespread_transcriptional_scanning_in_the_testis_modulates_gene_evolution_rates_34337648/"},{"date":"2018-03-02T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTControlling the expression of genes using a binary system involving the yeast GAL4 transcription factor has been a mainstay of Drosophila melanogaster developmental genetics for twenty-five years.

A special UAS promoter, UASp was created that does express during oogenesis, but the need to use different constructs for somatic and female germline cells has remained a significant technical limitation. Here we show that the expression problem of UASt and many other Drosophila molecular tools in germline cells is caused by their core Hsp70 promoter sequences, which are targeted in female germ cells by Hsp70-directed piRNAs generated from endogenous Hsp70 gene sequences. In a genetic background lacking genomic Hsp70 genes and associated piRNAs, UASt-based constructs function effectively during oogenesis.

Existing methods for computational prediction of regulatory elements primarily predict binding in genomic regions with sequence similarity to known transcription factor sequence preferences. This has limited efficacy since most binding sites do not resemble known transcription factor sequence motifs, and many transcription factors are not even sequence-specific.ResultsWe developed Virtual ChIP-seq, which predicts binding of individual transcription factors in new cell types using an artificial neural network that integrates ChIP-seq results from other cell types and chromatin accessibility data in the new cell type.

We also identified AXIN1, GRIK2, CAMK4, TRAF1 as hypomethylated genes with enhanced expression after loading that maintained their hypomethylated status even during unloading where muscle mass returned to control levels, indicating a memory of these genes methylation signatures following earlier hypertrophy. Further, UBR5, RPL35a, HEG1, PLA2G16, SETD3 displayed hypomethylation and enhanced gene expression following loading, and demonstrated the largest increases in hypomethylation, gene expression and muscle mass after later reloading, indicating an epigenetic memory in these genes. Finally, genes; GRIK2, TRAF1, BICC1, STAG1 were epigenetically sensitive to acute exercise demonstrating hypomethylation after a single bout of resistance exercise that was maintained 22 weeks later with the largest increase in gene expression and muscle mass after reloading. Overall, we identify an important epigenetic role for a number of largely unstudied genes in muscle hypertrophymemory.","tags":["scientific reports","genetics","500+-users","2018"],"title":"Human Skeletal Muscle Possesses an Epigenetic Memory of Hypertrophy, Scientific Reports, 2018-01-24","uri":"/reports/human_skeletal_muscle_possesses_an_epigenetic_memory_of_hypertrophy_32417785/"},{"date":"2018-01-18T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIn this modern, data-driven age, governments, funders and publishers expect greater transparency and reuse of research data, as well as greater access to and preservation of the data that supports research findings. Community-developed standards, such as those for the identification1 and reporting2 of data, underpin reproducible and reusable research, aid scholarly publishing, and drive both the discovery and evolution of scientific practice. The number of these standardization efforts, driven by large organizations or at the grass root level, has been on the rise since the early 2000s. Thousands of community-developed standards are available (across all disciplines), many of which have been created andor implemented by several thousand data repositories. Nevertheless, their uptake by the research community, however, has been slow and uneven. This is mainly because investigators lack incentives to follow and adopt standards. The situation is exacerbated if standards are not promptly implemented by databases, repositories and other research tools, or endorsed by infrastructures. Furthermore, the fragmentation of community efforts results in the development of arbitrarily different, incompatible standards. In turn, this leads to standards becoming rapidly obsolete in fast-evolving research areas.As with any other digital object, standards, databases and repositories are dynamic in nature, with a ‘life cycle’ that encompasses formulation, development and maintenance; their status in this cycle may vary depending on the level of activity of the developing group or community. There is an urgent need for a service that enhances the information available on the evolving constellation of heterogeneous standards, databases and repositories, guides users in the selection of these resources, and that works with developers and maintainers of these resources to foster collaboration and promote harmonization. Such an informative and educational service is vital to reduce the knowledge gap among those involved in producing, managing, serving, curating, preserving, publishing or regulating data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, standards organizations, infrastructure providers and scholarly publishers— both national and domain-specific as well global and general organizations— have come together as a community, representing the core adopters, advisory board members, andor key collaborators of the FAIRsharing resource. Here, we introduce its mission and community network. We present an evaluation of the standards landscape, focusing on those for reporting data and metadata - the most diverse and numerous of the standards - and their implementation by databases and repositories.

The chromosome was observed to exhibit a torus topology with a 4.2 μm toroidal length and 0.4 μm bundle thickness. On average, the DNA density along the chromosome shows dense right and left arms that branch from a lower-density origin of replication, and are connected at the terminus of replication by an ultrathin flexible string of DNA. At the single-cell level, the DNA density along the torus is found to be strikingly heterogeneous, with blob-like Mbp-size domains that undergo major dynamic rearrangements, splitting and merging at a minute timescale.

Currently, obtaining SIFs for microbial communities is challenging as the available methods either only provide limited taxonomic resolution, such as with the use of lipid biomarkers, or are limited in throughput, such as NanoSIMS imaging of single cells.Here we present “direct Protein-SIF” and the Calis-p software package (\u003cjatsext-link xmlnsxlink=httpwww.w3.org1999xlink ext-link-type=uri xlinkhref=httpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p\u003ehttpssourceforge.netprojectscalis-p\u003cjatsext-link\u003e), which enable high-throughput measurements of accurate δ13C values for individual species within a microbial community. We benchmark the method using 20 pure culture microorganisms and show that the method reproducibly provides SIF values consistent with gold standard bulk measurements performed with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Using mock community samples, we show that SIF values can also be obtained for individual species within a microbial community. Finally, a case study of an obligate bacteria-animal symbiosis showed that direct Protein-SIF confirms previous physiological hypotheses and can provide unexpected new insights into the symbionts’ metabolism.

These methods often only provide indirect evidence for which substrates are used by a microorganism in a community.

Central to this debate is whether wings evolved from an epipod (outgrowth, e.g., a gill) on ancestral crustacean leg segments, or represent a novel outgrowth from the dorsal body wall that co-opted some of the genes used to pattern the epipods. To determine whether wings can be traced to ancestral, pre-insect structures, or arose by co-option, comparisons are necessary between insects and arthropods more representative of the ancestral state, where the hypothesized proximal leg region is not fused to the body wall. To do so, we examined the function of five leg patterning genes in the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis and compared this to previous functional data from insects. By comparing gene knockout phenotypes of leg patterning genes in a crustacean with those of insects, we show that two ancestral crustacean leg segments were incorporated into the insect body, moving the leg’s epipod dorsally, up onto the back to form insect wings. Thus, our data shows that much of the body wall of insects, including the entire wing, is derived from these two ancestral proximal leg segments. This model explains all observations in favor of either the body wall origin or proximal leg origin of insect wings. Thus, our results show that insect wings are not novel structures, but instead evolved from existing, ancestral structures.One Sentence SummaryCRISPR-Cas9 knockout of leg gap genes in a crustacean reveals that insect wings are not novel structures, they evolved from crustacean leg segments","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Insect wings and body wall evolved from ancient leg segments, bioRxiv, 2018-01-10","uri":"/reports/insect_wings_and_body_wall_evolved_from_ancient_leg_segments_31454380/"},{"date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSpeciation genes are responsible for reproductive isolation between species. By directly participating in the process of speciation, the genealogies of isolating loci have been thought to more faithfully represent species trees. The unique properties of speciation genes may provide valuable evolutionary insights and help determine the true history of species divergence. Here, we formally analyze whether genealogies from loci participating in Dobzhansky-Muller (DM) incompatibilities are more likely to be concordant with the species tree under incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Individual loci differ stochastically from the true history of divergence with a predictable frequency due to ILS, and these expectations—combined with the DM model of intrinsic reproductive isolation from epistatic interactions—can be used to examine the probability of concordance at isolating loci. Contrary to existing verbal models, we find that reproductively isolating loci that follow the DM model are often more likely to have discordant gene trees. These results are dependent on the pattern of isolation observed between three species, the time between speciation events, and the time since the last speciation event. Results supporting a higher probability of discordance are found for both derived-derived and derived-ancestral DM pairs, and regardless of whether incompatibilities are allowed or prohibited from segregating in the same population. Our overall results suggest that DM loci are unlikely to be especially useful for reconstructing species relationships, even in the presence of gene flow between incipient species, and may in fact be positively misleading.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Speciation genes are more likely to have discordant gene trees, bioRxiv, 2018-01-09","uri":"/reports/speciation_genes_are_more_likely_to_have_discordant_gene_trees_31423756/"},{"date":"2018-01-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractEpigenetic regulation is mediated by protein complexes that couple recognition of chromatin marks to activity or recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes.

We found evidence of strong drift in southern mountains, but also signals of local adaptation in several populations, driven by temperature, precipitation, elevation and vegetation, especially when controlling for population history.

Multispecies coalescent (MSC) models have been shown to accurately account for the evolution of genes within species in the absence of strong gene flow between lineages, and fossilized birth-death (FBD) models have been shown to estimate divergence times from fossil data in good agreement with expert opinion. Until now dating analyses using the MSC have been based on a fixed clock or informally derived node priors instead of the FBD. On the other hand, dating analyses using an FBD process have concatenated all gene sequences and ignored coalescence processes. To address these mirror-image deficiencies in evolutionary models, we have developed an integrative model of evolution which combines both the FBD and MSC models. By applying concatenation and the MSC (without employing the FBD process) to an exemplar data set consisting of molecular sequence data and morphological characters from the dog and fox subfamily Caninae, we show that concatenation causes predictable biases in estimated branch lengths. We then applied concatenation using the FBD process and the combined FBD-MSC model to show that the same biases are still observed when the FBD process is employed. These biases can be avoided by using the FBD-MSC model, which coherently models fossilization and gene evolution, and does not require an a priori substitution rate estimate to calibrate the molecular clock.

Although this approach is prevalent and promising, our review identified four challenges. First, the composition of networks varied remarkably in terms of region parcellation and edge definition, which are fundamental to graph analyses. Second, many studies equated the number of connections across graphs, but this is conceptually problematic in clinical populations and may induce spurious group differences. Third, few graph metrics were reported in common, precluding meta-analyses.

Sequence comparisons suggest that derived alleles originated in the speckled pigeon (Columba guinea), providing a striking example of introgression of alleles that are favored by breeders and are potentially advantageous in the wild. In contrast, barless rock pigeons have an increased incidence of vision defects and, like two human families with hereditary blindness, carry start-codon mutations in NDP.

Here, we introduce an approach to modulating neural circuits noninvasively with spatial, cell-type and temporal specificity. This approach, called acoustically targeted chemogenetics, or ATAC, uses transient ultrasonic opening of the blood brain barrier to transduce neurons at specific locations in the brain with virally-encoded engineered G-protein-coupled receptors, which subsequently respond to systemically administered bio-inert compounds to activate or inhibit the activity of these neurons. We demonstrate this concept in mice by using ATAC to noninvasively modify and subsequently activate or inhibit excitatory neurons within the hippocampus, showing that this enables pharmacological control of memory formation. This technology allows a brief, noninvasive procedure to make one or more specific brain regions capable of being selectively modulated using orally bioavailable compounds, thereby overcoming some of the key limitations of conventional brain therapies.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2018"],"title":"Acoustically Targeted Chemogenetics for Noninvasive Control of Neural Circuits, bioRxiv, 2018-01-02","uri":"/reports/acoustically_targeted_chemogenetics_for_noninvasive_control_of_neural_circuits_31144328/"},{"date":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTN-glycanase 1 (NGLY1) Deficiency is a rare monogenic multi-system disorder first described in 2014.

Using a deep convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypic markers when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling and dropout strategies to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional marker data. We used a large GS dataset to train DeepGS and compare its performance with other methods. In terms of mean normalized discounted cumulative gain value, DeepGS achieves an increase of 27.70%~246.34% over a conventional neural network in selecting top-ranked 1% individuals with high phenotypic values for the eight tested traits. Additionally, compared with the widely used method RR-BLUP, DeepGS still yields a relative improvement ranging from 1.44% to 65.24%. Through extensive simulation experiments, we also demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of DeepGS for the absent of outlier individuals and subsets of genotypic markers.

This connection has flourished during the past two decades (3–7), giving rise to important insights into the ecology and evolution of cancer progression, with therapeutic implications (8–10). Here, we take a metapopulation view of metastasis (i.e. the migration to and colonization of, habitat patches) and represent it as a bipartite network, distinguishing source patches, or organs that host a primary tumor, and acceptor patches, or organs colonized ultimately from the source through metastasis. Using 20,326, biomedical records obtained from literature, we show that (i) the network structure of cancer ecosystems is non-random, exhibiting a nested subset pattern as has been found both in the distribution of species across islands and island-like habitats (11–13), and in the distribution of among species interactions across different ecological networks (14–16); (ii) similar to ecological networks, there is a heterogeneous distribution of degree (i.e., number of connections associated with a source or acceptor organ); (iii) there is a significant correlation between metastatic incidence (or the frequency with which tumor cells from a source organ colonize an acceptor one) and arterial blood supply, suggesting that more irrigated organs have a higher probability of developing metastasis or being invaded; (iv) there is a positive correlation between metastatic incidence and acceptor organ degree (or number of different tumor-bearing source organs that generate metastasis in a given acceptor organ), and a negative one between acceptor organ degree and number of stem cell divisions, implying that there are preferred sink organs for metastasis and that this could be related to average acceptor organ cell longevity; (v) there is a negative association between organ cell turnover and source organ degree, implying that organs with rapid cell turnovers tend to generate more metastasis, a process akin to the phenomenon of propagule pressure in ecology (17); and (vi) the cancer ecosystem network exhibits a modular structure in both source and acceptor patches, suggesting that some of them share more connections among themselves than with the rest of the network. We show that both niche-related processes occurring at the organ level as well as spatial connectivity and propagule pressure contribute to metastaticspread and result in a non-random cancer network, which exhibits a truncated power law degree distribution, clustering and a nested subset structure.

Here, we argue that humans use uncertainty inherent in their representations of value beliefs to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation. Such uncertainty is reflected in explicit confidence judgments. Using a novel variant of a multi-armed bandit paradigm, we studied how beliefs were formed and how uncertainty in the encoding of these value beliefs (belief confidence) evolved over time. We found that people used uncertainty to arbitrate between exploration and exploitation, reflected in a higher tendency towards exploration when their confidence in their value representations was low. We furthermore found that value uncertainty can be linked to frameworks of metacognition in decision making in two ways. First, belief confidence drives decision confidence—that is people’s evaluation of their own choices. Second, individuals with higher metacognitive insight into their choices were also better at tracing the uncertainty in their environment. Together, these findings argue that such uncertainty representations play a key role in the context of cognitive control.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Confidence modulates exploration and exploitation in value-based learning, bioRxiv, 2017-12-29","uri":"/reports/confidence_modulates_exploration_and_exploitation_in_value-based_learning_31006681/"},{"date":"2017-12-29T00:00:00Z","description":"Machine learning-based analysis of human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) patterns has enabled the visualization of perceptual content.

Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that the generated images resembled the stimulus images (both natural images and artificial shapes) and the subjective visual content during imagery. While our model was solely trained with natural images, our method successfully generalized the reconstruction to artificial shapes, indicating that our model indeed reconstructs or generates images from brain activity, not simply matches to exemplars. A natural image prior introduced by another deep neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to reconstructions by constraining reconstructed images to be similar to natural images. Furthermore, human judgment of reconstructions suggests the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance visual quality of generated images.

Consistently with earlier observations, we find that the vast majority of TFs have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from TFs bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar; however, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many TFs preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions at its solvent-exposed side. TFs often also bind nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation, because the nucleosome breaks the local rotational symmetry of DNA. Some TFs also specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position where only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other TFs prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them.

As the number of drugs increases, Bliss maintains accuracy while Loewe systematically loses its predictive power. The total dosage required for growth inhibition, which Loewe predicts should be fixed, steadily increases with the number of drugs, following a square root scaling. This scaling is explained by an approximation to Bliss where, inspired by RA Fisher’s classical geometric model 12, dosages of independent drugs adds up as orthogonal vectors rather than linearly. This dose-orthogonality approximation provides results similar to Bliss, yet uses the dosage language as Loewe and is hence easier to implement and intuit.

We developed a statistically rigorous strategy for combining significance levels from multiple driver discovery methods and demonstrate that the integrated results overcome limitations of individual methods. We combined this strategy with careful filtering and applied it to protein-coding genes, promoters, untranslated regions (UTRs), distal enhancers and non-coding RNAs. These analyses redefine the landscape of non-coding driver mutations in cancer genomes, confirming a few previously reported elements and raising doubts about others, while identifying novel candidate elements across 27 cancer types. Novel recurrent events were found in the promoters or 5’UTRs of TP53, RFTN1, RNF34, and MTG2, in the 3’UTRs of NFKBIZ and TOB1, and in the non-coding RNA RMRP. We provide evidence that the previously reported non-coding RNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1 may be subject to a localized mutational process. Perhaps the most striking finding is the relative paucity of point mutations driving cancer in non-coding genes and regulatory elements.

Dissociable brain circuits and cell-types are thought to preferentially participate in distinct learning mechanisms. For example, the activity of midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons is proposed to primarily, or even exclusively, reflect reward prediction error signals in well-trained animals. To study the specific contribution of individual circuits requires observing changes before tight functional coordination is achieved. However, little is known about the detailed timing of the emergence of reward-related representations in dopaminergic neurons. Here we recorded activity of identified dopaminergic neurons as naïve mice learned a novel stimulus-reward association. We found that at early stages of learning mDA neuron activity reflected both external (sensory) and internal (action initiation) causes of reward expectation. The increasingly precise correlation of action initiation with sensory stimuli rather than an evaluation of outcomes governed mDA neuron activity. Thus, our data demonstrate that mDA neuron activity early in learning does not reflect errors, but is more akin to a Hebbian learning signal - providing new insight into a critical computation in a highly conserved, essential learning circuit.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Emergence of reward expectation signals in identified dopamine neurons, bioRxiv, 2017-12-23","uri":"/reports/emergence_of_reward_expectation_signals_in_identified_dopamine_neurons_30829742/"},{"date":"2017-12-22T00:00:00Z","description":"SummaryThe diversity of cell types and regulatory states in the brain, and how these change during ageing, remains largely unknown.

It is commonly used to identify essential genes. Single gene deletion libraries are considered the gold standard for identifying essential genes. Currently, the TraDIS method has not been benchmarked against such libraries and therefore it remains unclear whether the two methodologies are comparable. To address this, a high density transposon library was constructed in Escherichia coli K-12. Essential genes predicted from sequencing of this library were compared to existing essential gene databases. To decrease false positive identification of essential gene candidates, statistical data analysis included corrections for both gene length and genome length. Through this analysis new essential genes and genes previously incorrectly designated as essential were identified. We show that manual analysis of TraDIS data reveals novel features that would not have been detected by statistical analysis alone. Examples include short essential regions within genes, orientation-dependent effects and fine resolution identification of genome and protein features. Recognition of these insertion profiles in transposon mutagenesis datasets will assist genome annotation of less well characterized genomes and provides new insights into bacterial physiology and biochemistry.IMPORTANCEIncentives to define lists of genes that are essential for bacterial survival include the identification of potential targets for antibacterial drug development, genes required for rapid growth for exploitation in biotechnology, and discovery of new biochemical pathways. To identify essential genes in E. coli, we constructed a very high density transposon mutant library. Initial automated analysis of the resulting data revealed many discrepancies when compared to the literature. We now report more extensive statistical analysis supported by both literature searches and detailed inspection of high density TraDIS sequencing data for each putative essential gene for the model laboratory organism, Escherichia coli.

Protein-coding driver mutations have been well-characterized by large exome-sequencing studies, however many tumors have no mutations in protein-coding driver genes. Non-coding mutations are thought to explain many of these cases, however few non-coding drivers besides TERT promoter are known. To fill this gap, we analyzed 150,000 cis-regulatory regions in 1,844 whole cancer genomes from the ICGC-TCGA PCAWG project. Using our new method, ActiveDriverWGS, we found 41 frequently mutated regulatory elements (FMREs) enriched in non-coding SNVs and indels (FDR\u0026lt;0.05) characterized by aging-associated mutation signatures and frequent structural variants. Most FMREs are distal from genes, reported here for the first time and also recovered by additional driver discovery methods. FMREs were enriched in super-enhancers, H3K27ac enhancer marks of primary tumors and long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that the mutations drive cancer by distally controlling gene expression through threedimensional genome organization. In support of this hypothesis, the chromatin interaction network of FMREs and target genes revealed associations of mutations and differential gene expression of known and novel cancer genes (e.g., CNNB1IP1, RCC1), activation of immune response pathways and altered enhancer marks. Thus distal genomic regions may include additional, infrequently mutated drivers that act on target genes via chromatin loops. Our study is an important step towards finding such regulatory regions and deciphering the somatic mutation landscape of the non-coding genome.","tags":["biorxiv","cancer-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Candidate cancer driver mutations in superenhancers and long-range chromatin interaction networks, bioRxiv, 2017-12-20","uri":"/reports/candidate_cancer_driver_mutations_in_superenhancers_and_long-range_chromatin_interaction_networks_30681318/"},{"date":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","description":"Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in the life-sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, the chemistry of the fluorophores, and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample.

Midbrain dopamine neurons underwent neurophysiological adaptations that mirrored this phenotypic divergence in individual behaviors.

Indeed, the brain’s visual and navigational systems are known to interact5, 6, and signals related to position in the environment have been suggested to appear as early as in visual cortex6, 7. To establish the nature of these signals we recorded in primary visual cortex (V1) and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus while mice traversed a corridor in virtual reality. The corridor contained identical visual landmarks in two positions, so that a purely visual neuron would respond similarly in those positions. Most V1 neurons, however, responded solely or more strongly to the landmarks in one position. This modulation of visual responses by spatial location was not explained by factors such as running speed. To assess whether the modulation is related to navigational signals and to the animal’s subjective estimate of position, we trained the mice to lick for a water reward upon reaching a reward zone in the corridor. Neuronal populations in both CA1 and V1 encoded the animal’s position along the corridor, and the errors in their representations were correlated. Moreover, both representations reflected the animal’s subjective estimate of position, inferred from the animal’s licks, better than its actual position. Indeed, when animals licked in a given location – whether correct or incorrect – neural populations in both V1 and CA1 placed the animal in the reward zone. We conclude that visual responses in V1 are tightly controlled by navigational signals, which are coherent with those encoded in hippocampus, and reflect the animal’s subjective position in the environment. The presence of such navigational signals as early as in a primary sensory area suggests that these signals permeate sensory processing in the cortex.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Coherent representations of subjective spatial position in primary visual cortex and hippocampus, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19","uri":"/reports/coherent_representations_of_subjective_spatial_position_in_primary_visual_cortex_and_hippocampus_30614236/"},{"date":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","description":"This report describes an error in the Framingham Risk Score data presented in the original SPRINT publication.1 The data, presented in Table 1 of the main SPRINT publication in the New England Journal of Medicine and made available to SPRINT Challenge participants, incorrectly calculated the level of baseline cardiovascular risk of the study participants using the Framingham Risk Score.

Because spliceosome assembly and catalysis occur co-transcriptionally, we hypothesized that introns are removed in the order of their transcription in genomes dominated by constitutive splicing. Remarkably little is known about splicing order and the regulatory potential of nascent transcript remodeling by splicing, due to the limitations of existing methods that focus on analysis of mature splicing products (mRNAs) rather than substrates and intermediates. Here, we overcome this obstacle through long-read RNA sequencing of nascent, multi-intron transcripts in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Most multi-intron transcripts were fully spliced, consistent with rapid co-transcriptional splicing. However, an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts were either fully spliced or fully unspliced, suggesting that splicing of any given intron is dependent on the splicing status of other introns in the transcript. Supporting this, mild inhibition of splicing by a temperature-sensitive mutation in Prp2, the homolog of vertebrate U2AF65, increased the frequency of fully unspliced transcripts. Importantly, fully unspliced transcripts displayed transcriptional read-through at the polyA site and were degraded co-transcriptionally by the nuclear exosome. Finally, we show that cellular mRNA levels were reduced in genes with a high number of unspliced nascent transcripts during caffeine treatment, showing regulatory significance of co-transcriptional splicing. Therefore, overall splicing of individual nascent transcripts, 3’ end formation, and mRNA half-life depend on the splicing status of neighboring introns, suggesting crosstalk among spliceosomes and the polyA cleavage machinery during transcription elongation.","tags":["biorxiv","molecular-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Long-read sequencing of nascent RNA reveals coupling among RNA processing events, bioRxiv, 2017-12-19","uri":"/reports/long-read_sequencing_of_nascent_rna_reveals_coupling_among_rna_processing_events_30642254/"},{"date":"2017-12-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe sarcomere is the basic contractile unit within cardiomyocytes driving heart muscle contraction.

The problem of scale is central to community ecology, where functional ecological groups are aggregated and treated as a unit underlying an ecological pattern, such as aggregation of “nitrogen fixing trees” into a total abundance of a trait underlying ecosystem physiology. With the emergence of massive community ecological datasets, from microbiomes to breeding bird surveys, there is a need to objectively identify the scales of organization pertaining to well-defined patterns in community ecological data.The phylogeny is a scaffold for identifying key phylogenetic scales associated with macroscopic patterns. Phylofactorization was developed to objectively identify phylogenetic scales underlying patterns in relative abundance data. However, many ecological data, such as presence-absences and counts, are not relative abundances, yet it is still desireable and informative to identify phylogenetic scales underlying a pattern of interest. Here, we generalize phylofactorization beyond relative abundances to a graph-partitioning algorithm for any community ecological data.Generalizing phylofactorization connects many tools from data analysis to phylogenetically-informe analysis of community ecological data. Two-sample tests identify three phylogenetic factors of mammalian body mass which arose during the K-Pg extinction event, consistent with other analyses of mammalian body mass evolution. Projection of data onto coordinates defined by the phylogeny yield a phylogenetic principal components analysis which refines our understanding of the major sources of variation in the human gut microbiome. These same coordinates allow generalized additive modeling of microbes in Central Park soils and confirm that a large clade of Acidobacteria thrive in neutral soils. Generalized linear and additive modeling of exponential family random variables can be performed by phylogenetically-constrained reduced-rank regression or stepwise factor contrasts. We finish with a discussion of how phylofac-torization produces an ecological species concept with a phylogenetic constraint. All of these tools can be implemented with a new R package available online.","tags":["biorxiv","ecology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Phylofactorization a graph-partitioning algorithm to identify phylogenetic scales of ecological data, bioRxiv, 2017-12-17","uri":"/reports/phylofactorization_a_graph-partitioning_algorithm_to_identify_phylogenetic_scales_of_ecological_data_30533791/"},{"date":"2017-12-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractAmplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is the predominant method to quantify microbial compositions of environmental samples and to discover previously unknown lineages. Its unique structure of interspersed conserved and variable regions is an excellent target for PCR and allows for classification of reads at all taxonomic levels. However, the relatively few phylogenetically informative sites prevent confident phylogenetic placements of novel lineages that are deep branching relative to reference taxa. This problem is exacerbated when only short 16S rRNA gene fragments are sequenced. To resolve their placement, it is common practice to gather more informative sites by combining multiple conserved genes into concatenated datasets. This however requires genomic data which may be obtained through relatively expensive metagenome sequencing and computationally demanding analyses. Here we develop a protocol that amplifies a large part of 16S and 23S rRNA genes within the rRNA operon, including the ITS region, and sequences the amplicons with PacBio long-read technology. We tested our method with a synthetic mock community and developed a read curation pipeline that reduces the overall error rate to 0.18%. Applying our method on four diverse environmental samples, we were able to capture near full-length rRNA operon amplicons from a large diversity of prokaryotes. Phylogenetic trees constructed with these sequences showed an increase in statistical support compared to trees inferred with shorter, Illumina-like sequences using only the 16S rRNA gene (250 bp).

In addition, a southern coastal route has been relentlessly imposed to explain the Eurasian colonization of these African pioneers. Based on the age of macrohaplogroup L3, from which all maternal Eurasian and the majority of African lineages originated, that out-of-Africa event has been dated around 60-70 kya. On the opposite side, we have proposed a northern route through Central Asia across the Levant for that expansion. Consistent with the fossil record, we have dated it around 125 kya. To help bridge differences between the molecular and fossil record ages, in this article we assess the possibility that mtDNA macrohaplogroup L3 matured in Eurasia and returned to Africa as basic L3 lineages around 70 kya.ResultsThe coalescence ages of all Eurasian (M,N) and African L3 lineages, both around 71 kya, are not significantly different. The oldest M and N Eurasian clades are found in southeastern Asia instead near of Africa as expected by the southern route hypothesis. The split of the Y-chromosome composite DE haplogroup is very similar to the age of mtDNA L3. A Eurasian origin and back migration to Africa has been proposed for the African Y-chromosome haplogroup E. Inside Africa, frequency distributions of maternal L3 and paternal E lineages are positively correlated. This correlation is not fully explained by geographic or ethnic affinities. It seems better to be the result of a joint and global replacement of the old autochthonous male and female African lineages by the new Eurasian incomers.ConclusionsThese results are congruent with a model proposing an out-of-Africa of early anatomically modern humans around 125 kya. A return to Africa of Eurasian fully modern humans around 70 kya, and a second Eurasian global expansion by 60 kya.

Key to interpreting these patterns is estimating the underlying dimensionality of neural representations. Dimensions may correspond to psychological dimensions, such as length and orientation, or involve other coding schemes. Unfortunately, the noise structure of fMRI data inflates dimensionality estimates and thus makes it difficult to assess the true underlying dimensionality of a pattern. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach to identify brain regions that carry reliable task-modulated signal and to derive an estimate of the signal’s functional dimensionality. We combined singular value decomposition with cross-validation to find the best low-dimensional projection of a pattern of voxel-responses at a single-subject level. Goodness of the low-dimensional reconstruction is measured as Pearson correlation with a test set, which allows to test for significance of the low-dimensional reconstruction across participants. Using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, we derive the best estimate and associated uncertainty of underlying dimensionality across participants. We validated our method on simulated data of varying underlying dimensionality, showing that recovered dimensionalities match closely true dimensionalities. We then applied our method to three published fMRI data sets all involving processing of visual stimuli. The results highlight three possible applications of estimating the functional dimensionality of neural data. Firstly, it can aid evaluation of model-based analyses by revealing which areas express reliable, task-modulated signal that could be missed by specific models. Secondly, it can reveal functional differences across brain regions.

Most, if not all, of these inference methods exhibit pathological behavior, however. Specifically, they often display runaway behavior in optimization, where the inferred population sizes and epoch durations can degenerate to 0 or diverge to infinity, and show undesirable sensitivity of the inferred demography to perturbations in the data. The goal of this paper is to provide theoretical insights into why such problems arise. To this end, we characterize the geometry of the expected SFS for piecewise-constant demographic histories and use our results to show that the aforementioned pathological behavior of popular inference methods is intrinsic to the geometry of the expected SFS. We provide explicit descriptions and visualizations for a toy model with sample size 4, and generalize our intuition to arbitrary sample sizes n using tools from convex and algebraic geometry. We also develop a universal characterization result which shows that the expected SFS of a sample of size n under an arbitrary population history can be recapitulated by a piecewise-constant demography with only κn epochs, where κn is between n2 and 2n – 1.

The genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGluSnFR enables visualization of glutamate release from presynaptic terminals at frequencies up to ∼10 Hz. However, to resolve glutamate dynamics during high frequency bursts, faster indicators are required. Here we report the development of fast (iGluf) and ultrafast (iGluu) variants with comparable brightness, but increased Kd for glutamate (137 μM and 600 μM, respectively). Compared to iGluSnFR, iGluu has a 6-fold faster dissociation rate in vitro and 5-fold faster kinetics in synapses. Fitting a three-state model to kinetic data, we identify the large conformational change after glutamate binding as the rate-limiting step. In rat hippocampal slice culture stimulated at 100 Hz, we find that iGluu is sufficiently fast to resolve individual glutamate release events, revealing that glutamate is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft. Depression of iGluu responses during 100 Hz trains correlates with depression of postsynaptic EPSPs, indicating that depression during high frequency stimulation is purely presynaptic in origin. At individual boutons, the recovery from depression could be predicted from the amount of glutamate released on the second pulse (paired pulse facilitationdepression), demonstrating differential frequency-dependent filtering of spike trains at Schaffer collateral boutons.Significance StatementExcitatory synapses convert presynaptic action potentials into chemical signals that are sensed by postsynaptic glutamate receptors. To eavesdrop on synaptic transmission, genetically encoded fluorescent sensors for glutamate have been developed. However, even the best available sensors lag behind the very fast glutamate dynamics in the synaptic cleft. Here we report the development of an ultrafast genetically encoded glutamate sensor, iGluu, which allowed us to image glutamate clearance and synaptic depression during 100 Hz spike trains. We found that only boutons showing paired-pulse facilitation were able to rapidly recover from depression. Thus, presynaptic boutons act as frequency-specific filters to transmit select features of the spike train to specific postsynaptic cells.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Ultrafast glutamate sensors resolve high-frequency release at Schaffer collateral synapses, bioRxiv, 2017-12-14","uri":"/reports/ultrafast_glutamate_sensors_resolve_high-frequency_release_at_schaffer_collateral_synapses_30393707/"},{"date":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractIn Drosophila melanogaster, the germband forms directly on the egg surface and solely consists of embryonic tissue. In contrast, most insect embryos undergo a complicated set of tissue rearrangements to generate a condensed, multi-layered germband. The ventral side of the germband is embryonic, while the dorsal side is thought to be an extraembryonic tissue called the amnion. While this tissue organisation has been accepted for decades, and has been widely reported in insects, its accuracy has not been directly tested in any species. Using live cell tracking and differential cell labelling in the short germ beetle Tribolium castaneum, I show that most of the cells previously thought to be amnion actually give rise to large parts of the embryo. This process occurs via the dorsal-to-ventral flow of cells and contributes to germband extension. In addition, I show that true ‘amnion’ cells in Tribolium originate from a small region of the blastoderm. Together, my findings show that development in the short germ embryos of Tribolium and the long germ embryos of Drosophila is more similar than previously proposed. Dorsal-to-ventral cell flow also occurs in Drosophila during germband extension, and I argue that the flow is driven by a conserved set of underlying morphogenetic events in both species. Furthermore, the revised Tribolium fatemap that I present is far more similar to that of Drosophila than the classic Tribolium fatemap. Lastly, my findings show that there is no qualitative difference between the tissue structure of the cellularised blastoderm and the shortintermediate germ germband. As such, the same tissue patterning mechanisms could function continuously throughout the cellularised blastoderm and germband stages, and easily shift between them over evolutionary time.Author summaryIn many animals, certain groups of cells in the embryo do not directly contribute to adult structures. Instead, these cells generate so-called ‘extra-embryonic tissues’ that support and facilitate development, but degenerate prior to birthhatching. In most insect species, embryos are described as having two major extra-embryonic tissues; the serosa, which encapsulates the entire embryo and yolk, and the amnion, which covers one side of the embryo. This tissue structure has been widely reported for over a century, but detailed studies on the amnion are lacking. Working in the beetle Tribolium castaneum, I used long-term fluorescent live imaging, cell tracking and differential cell labelling to investigate amnion development. In contrast to our current understanding, I show that most cells previously thought to be amnion actually form large parts of the embryo. In addition, I show how these cells ‘flow’ as a whole tissue and contribute to elongation of the embryo, and how only a relatively small number of cells form the actual amnion. Lastly, I describe how my findings show that despite exhibiting substantial differences in overall structure, embryos of Tribolium and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, utilise a conserved set of morphogenetic processes.","tags":["biorxiv","developmental-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"A revised understanding of Tribolium morphogenesis further reconciles short and long germ development, bioRxiv, 2017-12-13","uri":"/reports/a_revised_understanding_of_tribolium_morphogenesis_further_reconciles_short_and_long_germ_development_30343453/"},{"date":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","description":"ABSTRACTPathway enrichment analysis helps gain mechanistic insight into large gene lists typically resulting from genome scale (–omics) experiments.

Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides and affix in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the fly nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes.

We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies and associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a population of descending neurons, we found, that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically-activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Optogenetic dissection of descending behavioral control in Drosophila, bioRxiv, 2017-12-10","uri":"/reports/optogenetic_dissection_of_descending_behavioral_control_in_drosophila_30220788/"},{"date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractTranscriptional activation domains are intrinsically disordered peptides with little primary sequence conservation.

To address this question we designed a rational mutagenesis scheme to independently test four sequence features theorized to control the strength of activation domains acidity (negative charge), hydrophobicity, intrinsic disorder, and short linear motifs. To test enough mutants to deconvolve these four features we developed a method to quantify the activities of thousands of activation domain variants in parallel. Our results with Gcn4, a classic acidic activation domain, suggest that acidic residues in particular regions keep two hydrophobic motifs exposed to solvent. We also found that the specific activity of the Gcn4 activation domain increases during amino acid starvation. Our results suggest that Gcn4 may have evolved to have low activity but high inducibility.

Guillardia theta anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (GtACRs) are promising in this regard, due to their high single-channel conductance and favorable photon-ion stoichiometry. However, GtACRs show poor membrane targeting in mammalian cells, and the activity of such channels can cause transient excitation in the axon due to an excitatory chloride reversal potential in this compartment. Here we address both problems by enhancing membrane targeting and subcellular compartmentalization of GtACRs.

Here we have harnessed the haplotype-based method fineSTRUCTURE in an Irish genome-wide SNP dataset, identifying 23 discrete genetic clusters which segregate with geographical provenance. Cluster diversity is pronounced in the west of Ireland but reduced in the east where older structure has been eroded by historical migrations. Accordingly, when populations from the neighbouring island of Britain are included, a west-east cline of Celtic-British ancestry is revealed along with a particularly striking correlation between haplotypes and geography across both islands. A strong relationship is revealed between subsets of Northern Irish and Scottish populations, where discordant genetic and geographic affinities reflect major migrations in recent centuries. Additionally, Irish genetic proximity of all Scottish samples likely reflects older strata of communication across the narrowest inter-island crossing. Using GLOBETROTTER we detected Irish admixture signals from Britain and Europe and estimated dates for events consistent with the historical migrations of the Norse-Vikings, the Anglo-Normans and the British Plantations. The influence of the former is greater than previously estimated from Y chromosome haplotypes. In all, we paint a new picture of the genetic landscape of Ireland, revealing structure which should be considered in the design of studies examining rare genetic variation and its association with traits.Author summaryA recent genetic study of the UK (People of the British Isles; PoBI) expanded our understanding of population history of the islands, using newly-developed, powerful techniques that harness the rich information embedded in chunks of genetic code called haplotypes. These methods revealed subtle regional diversity across the UK, and, using genetic data alone, timed key migration events into southeast England and Orkney. We have extended these methods to Ireland, identifying regional differences in genetics across the island that adhere to geography at a resolution not previously reported. Our study reveals relative western diversity and eastern homogeneity in Ireland owing to a history of settlement concentrated on the east coast and longstanding Celtic diversity in the west. We show that Irish Celtic diversity enriches the findings of PoBI; haplotypes mirror geography across Britain and Ireland, with relic Celtic populations contributing greatly to haplotypic diversity. Finally, we used genetic information to date migrations into Ireland from Europe and Britain consistent with historical records of Viking and Norman invasions, demonstrating the signatures of these migrations the on modern Irish genome. Our findings demonstrate that genetic structure exists in even small isolated populations, which has important implications for population-based genetic association studies.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Insular Celtic population structure and genomic footprints of migration, bioRxiv, 2017-12-09","uri":"/reports/insular_celtic_population_structure_and_genomic_footprints_of_migration_30168232/"},{"date":"2017-12-09T00:00:00Z","description":"Cellular elongation requires the defined coordination of intra- and extracellular processes.

It remains, however, completely unknown how the vacuolar size is coordinated with other growth-relevant processes.

However, standard short-read approaches, used primarily due to accuracy, throughput and costs, fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify large, balanced structural events, cannot access repetitive regions of the genome and fail to resolve the human genome into its two haplotypes. Here we describe an approach that retains long range information while harnessing the advantages of short reads. Starting from only ∼1ng of DNA, we produce barcoded short read libraries. The use of novel informatic approaches allows for the barcoded short reads to be associated with the long molecules of origin producing a novel datatype known as ‘Linked-Reads’. This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single Linked-Read library. We have previously demonstrated the utility of whole genome Linked-Reads (lrWGS) for performing diploid, de novo assembly of individual genomes (Weisenfeld et al. 2017). In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short read approaches for reference based analysis. We demonstrate the ability of Linked-Reads to reconstruct megabase scale haplotypes and to recover parts of the genome that are typically inaccessible to short reads, including phenotypically important genes such as STRC, SMN1 and SMN2. We demonstrate the ability of both lrWGS and Linked-Read Whole Exome Sequencing (lrWES) to identify complex structural variations, including balanced events, single exon deletions, and single exon duplications.

In this paper, we argue that this way of thinking about PCMs is deeply misleading. Not only has this sowed widespread confusion in the literature about what PCMs are doing but has led us to develop methods that are susceptible to the very thing we sought to build defenses against --- unreplicated evolutionary events. Through three Case Studies, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to singular events is indeed a recurring problem in comparative biology that links several seemingly unrelated controversies. In each Case Study we propose a potential solution to the problem. While the details of our proposed solutions differ, they share a common theme unifying hypothesis testing with data-driven approaches (which we term phylogenetic natural history) to disentangle the impact of singular evolutionary events from that of the factors we are investigating. More broadly, we argue that our field has, at times, been sloppy when weighing evidence in support of causal hypotheses.

We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing (1) “bag-of-words” which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built “bag-of-k-mers” and “vector-k-mers” models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an accuracy above 90%. Our “bag-of-k-mers” achieved higher overall accuracy, while the “vector-k-mers” models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy.","tags":["biorxiv","plant-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"k-mer grammar uncovers maize regulatory architecture, bioRxiv, 2017-12-06","uri":"/reports/k-mer_grammar_uncovers_maize_regulatory_architecture_29241814/"},{"date":"2017-12-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractCharacterizing the evolutionary history of a gene’s expression profile is a critical component for understanding the relationship between genotype, expression, and phenotype.

Furthermore, it facilitates studying the selective processes that lead to the accumulation or depletion of introgressed genetic variation. Recent studies have developed methods to localize these introgressed regions, reporting long regions that are depleted of Neanderthal introgression and enriched in genes, suggesting negative selection against the Neanderthal variants.

These biflagellated cells have two actin genes one encoding a conventional actin (IDA5) and the other encoding a divergent novel actin-like protein (NAP1). Previously, we described a role for actin in the regulation of flagella-building intraflagellar transport machinery. Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to this process using a nap1 mutant Chlamydomonas strain. Disruption of a single actin allows normal or slower incorporation but complete flagellar assembly. However, when we disrupt both actins using Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins is actin-dependent. Upon total actin disruption during flagellar assembly, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles, suggesting impaired vesicular trafficking may be the mechanism by which actin supports flagellar growth from new flagellar proteins. We also find there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Extended (2 hour) treatment with LatB, a condition under which NAP1 is upregulated, restores NPHP-4 localization. This suggests NAP1 can perform the functions of conventional actin at the transition zone. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.","tags":["biorxiv","cell-biology","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Partially redundant actin genes in Chlamydomonas control flagellum-directed traffic and transition zone organization, bioRxiv, 2017-12-01","uri":"/reports/partially_redundant_actin_genes_in_chlamydomonas_control_flagellum-directed_traffic_and_transition_zone_organization_29742284/"},{"date":"2017-11-30T00:00:00Z","description":"Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an (Δ𝜇, 𝑁, 𝑝, 𝑇) ensemble.

However, whether conspecifics pay attention to facial masculinity has only been assessed in humans. In a study of free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, we used a two-alternative look-time experiment to test whether females perceive male facial masculinity. We presented 107 females with pairs of images of male faces – one with a more masculine shape and one more feminine – and recorded their looking behaviour. Females looked at the masculine face longer than at the feminine face in more trials than predicted by chance. Although there was no overall difference in average look-time between masculine and feminine faces across all trials, females looked significantly longer at masculine faces in a subset of trials for which the within-pair difference in masculinity was most pronounced. Additionally, the proportion of time subjects looked toward the masculine face increased as the within-pair difference in masculinity increased. This study provides evidence that female macaques perceive variation in male facial shape, a necessary condition for intersexual selection to operate on such a trait. It also highlights the potential impact of perceptual thresholds on look-time experiments.","tags":["biorxiv","animal-behavior-and-cognition","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Experimental evidence that female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) perceive variation in male facial masculinity, bioRxiv, 2017-11-25","uri":"/reports/experimental_evidence_that_female_rhesus_macaques_macaca_mulatta_perceive_variation_in_male_facial_masculinity_29237179/"},{"date":"2017-11-25T00:00:00Z","description":"Neurons in sensory cortex are tuned to diverse features in natural scenes. But what determines which features neurons become selective to? Here we explore the idea that neuronal selectivity is optimised to represent features in the recent past of sensory input that best predict immediate future inputs. We tested this hypothesis using simple feedforward neural networks, which were trained to predict the next few video or audio frames in clips of natural scenes. The networks developed receptive fields that closely matched those of real cortical neurons, including the oriented spatial tuning of primary visual cortex, the frequency selectivity of primary auditory cortex and, most notably, in their temporal tuning properties. Furthermore, the better a network predicted future inputs the more closely its receptive fields tended to resemble those in the brain. This suggests that sensory processing is optimised to extract those features with the most capacity to predict future input.Impact statementPrediction of future input explains diverse neural tuning properties in sensory cortex.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","0-100-users","2017"],"title":"Sensory cortex is optimised for prediction of future input, bioRxiv, 2017-11-25","uri":"/reports/sensory_cortex_is_optimised_for_prediction_of_future_input_29402530/"},{"date":"2017-11-24T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractExome capture is an effective tool for surveying the genome for loci under selection. However, traditional methods require annotated genomic resources.

This approach, called “EecSeq”, eliminates the need for costly probe design and synthesis. We tested EecSeq in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, using a controlled exposure experiment. Four adult oysters were heat shocked at 36° C for 1 hour along with four control oysters kept at 14° C. Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared for two individuals from each treatment and pooled. Half of the combined library was used for probe synthesis and half was sequenced to evaluate capture efficiency. Genomic DNA was extracted from all individuals, enriched via captured probes, and sequenced directly. We found that EecSeq had an average capture sensitivity of 86.8% across all known exons and had over 99.4% sensitivity for exons with detectable levels of expression in the mRNA library. For all mapped reads, over 47.9% mapped to exons and 37.0% mapped to expressed targets, which is similar to previously published exon capture studies. EecSeq displayed relatively even coverage within exons (i.e. minor “edge effects”) and even coverage across exon GC content. We discovered 5,951 SNPs with a minimum average coverage of 80X, with 3,508 SNPs appearing in exonic regions.

One crucial ingredient responsible for this progress is the rise of neural decoding techniques. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. Here, we aimed to contribute to the field by subjecting human volunteers to a combined VWMimagery task, while recording and decoding their neural signals as measured by MEG. At first sight, the results seem to provide evidence for a persistent, stable representation of the memorandum throughout the delay period. However, control analyses revealed that these findings can be explained by subtle, VWM-specific eye movements. As a potential remedy, we demonstrate the use of a functional localizer, which was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements, to train the neural decoders. This analysis revealed a sustained representation for approximately 1 second, but no longer throughout the entire delay period. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.Significance statementVisual working memory is an important aspect of higher cognition and has been subject of much investigation within the field of cognitive neuroscience. Over recent years, these studies have increasingly relied on the use of neural decoding techniques. Here, we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by stimulus-specific eye movements. Such eye movements during working memory have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon.

There are currently two distinct views of genome organization that are derived from different technologies. The first view, derived from genome-wide proximity ligation methods (e.g. Hi-C), suggests that genome organization is largely organized around chromosomes. The second view, derived from in situ imaging, suggests a central role for nuclear bodies. Yet, because microscopy and proximity-ligation methods measure different aspects of genome organization, these two views remain poorly reconciled and our overall understanding of how genomic DNA is organized within the nucleus remains incomplete. Here, we develop Split-Pool Recognition of Interactions by Tag Extension (SPRITE), which moves away from proximity-ligation and enables genome-wide detection of higher-order DNA interactions within the nucleus. Using SPRITE, we recapitulate known genome structures identified by Hi-C and show that the contact frequencies measured by SPRITE strongly correlate with the 3-dimensional distances measured by microscopy. In addition to known structures, SPRITE identifies two major hubs of inter-chromosomal interactions that are spatially arranged around the nucleolus and nuclear speckles, respectively. We find that the majority of genomic regions exhibit preferential spatial association relative to one of these nuclear bodies, with regions that are highly transcribed by RNA Polymerase II organizing around nuclear speckles and transcriptionally inactive and centromere-proximal regions organizing around the nucleolus. Together, our results reconcile the two distinct pictures of nuclear structure and demonstrate that nuclear bodies act as inter-chromosomal hubs that shape the overall 3-dimensional packaging of genomic DNA in the nucleus.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Higher-order inter-chromosomal hubs shape 3-dimensional genome organization in the nucleus, bioRxiv, 2017-11-19","uri":"/reports/higher-order_inter-chromosomal_hubs_shape_3-dimensional_genome_organization_in_the_nucleus_29113092/"},{"date":"2017-11-19T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe alpha rhythm is the longest studied brain oscillation and has been theorized to play a key role in cognition.

We first found that alpha in posterior cortex propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas towards the occipital pole, consistent with alpha effecting top-down processing. This cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpharhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback which propagates from higher to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus.

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal MGEs in the gut microbiome using a method called Split Read Insertion Detection (SRID) that enables the identification of the exact mobilizable unit of MGEs.

We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 884 young healthy adults in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database. We attempted to predict personality traits from the “Big Five”, as assessed with the NEO-FFI test, using individual functional connectivity matrices. After regressing out potential confounds (such as age, sex, handedness and fluid intelligence), we used a cross-validated framework, together with test-retest replication (across two sessions of resting-state fMRI for each subject), to quantify how well the neuroimaging data could predict each of the five personality factors. We tested three different (published) denoising strategies for the fMRI data, two inter-subject alignment and brain parcellation schemes, and three different linear models for prediction. As measurement noise is known to moderate statistical relationships, we performed final prediction analyses using average connectivity across both imaging sessions (1 h of data), with the analysis pipeline that yielded the highest predictability overall. Across all results (testretest; 3 denoising strategies; 2 alignment schemes; 3 models), Openness to experience emerged as the only reliably predicted personality factor. Using the full hour of resting-state data and the best pipeline, we could predict Openness to experience (NEOFAC_O r=0.24, R2=0.024) almost as well as we could predict the score on a 24-item intelligence test (PMAT24_A_CR r=0.26, R2=0.044). Other factors (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness) yielded weaker predictions across results that were not statistically significant under permutation testing. We also derived two superordinate personality factors (“α” and “β”) from a principal components analysis of the NEO-FFI factor scores, thereby reducing noise and enhancing the precision of these measures of personality. We could account for 5% of the variance in the β superordinate factor (r=0.27, R2=0.050), which loads highly on Openness to experience.

While the ecological dynamics have been extensively studied, much less is known about how species of gut bacteria evolve over time. Here we introduce a model-based framework for quantifying evolutionary dynamics within and across hosts using a panel of metagenomic samples. We use this approach to study evolution in ∼30 prevalent species in the human gut. Although the patterns of between-host diversity are consistent with quasi-sexual evolution and purifying selection on long timescales, we identify new genealogical signatures that challenge standard population genetic models of these processes. Within hosts, we find that genetic differences that accumulate over ∼6 month timescales are only rarely attributable to replacement by distantly related strains. Instead, the resident strains more commonly acquire a smaller number of putative evolutionary changes, in which nucleotide variants or gene gains or losses rapidly sweep to high frequency. By comparing these mutations with the typical between-host differences, we find evidence that some sweeps are seeded by recombination, in addition to new mutations. However, comparisons of adult twins suggest that replacement eventually overwhelms evolution over multi-decade timescales, hinting at fundamental limits to the extent of local adaptation. Together, our results suggest that gut bacteria can evolve on human-relevant timescales, and they highlight the connections between these short-term evolutionary dynamics and longer-term evolution across hosts.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"Evolutionary dynamics of bacteria in the gut microbiome within and across hosts, bioRxiv, 2017-10-31","uri":"/reports/evolutionary_dynamics_of_bacteria_in_the_gut_microbiome_within_and_across_hosts_28127345/"},{"date":"2017-10-28T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractVariation in gut microbiome is associated with wellness and disease in humans, yet the molecular mechanisms by which this variation affects the host are not well understood.

Here, we treated colonic epithelial cells with live microbiota from five healthy individuals and quantified induced changes in transcriptional regulation and chromatin accessibility in host cells. We identified over 5,000 host genes that change expression, including 588 distinct associations between specific taxa and host genes. The taxa with the strongest influence on gene expression alter the response of genes associated with complex traits. Using ATAC-seq, we show that a subset of these changes in gene expression are likely the result of changes in host chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding induced by exposure to gut microbiota. We then created a manipulated microbial community with titrated doses of Collinsella, demonstrating that both natural and controlled microbiome composition leads to distinct, and predictable, gene expression profiles in host cells. Together, our results suggest that specific microbes play an important role in regulating expression of individual host genes involved in human complex traits.

In contrast to previous studies based on mRNA expression or protein abundance, we found that a set of TFs binding to only around ten distinct motifs display strong DNA-binding activity in any given cell or tissue type. Mass spectrometric identification of TFs revealed that within these highly active TFs, there were both housekeeping TFs, which were universally found in all cell types, and specific TFs, which were highly enriched in known factors that determine the fate of the analyzed tissue or cell type.

We identify signals of polygenic adaptation for anthropometric traits including height, infant head circumference (IHC), hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Analysis of ancient DNA samples indicates that a north-south cline of height within Europe and and a west-east cline across Eurasia can be traced to selection for increased height in two late Pleistocene hunter gatherer populations living in western and west-central Eurasia. Our observation that IHC and WHR follow a latitudinal cline in Western Eurasia support the role of natural selection driving Bergmann’s Rule in humans, consistent with thermoregulatory adaptation in response to latitudinal temperature variation.Author’s Note on Failure to ReplicateAfter this preprint was posted, the UK Biobank dataset was released, providing a new and open GWAS resource.

Pseudotemporal analysis revealed a subset of elements bound by MYOD in myoblasts that exhibit early opening, potentially serving as the initial sites of recruitment of chromatin remodeling and histone-modifying enzymes.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is becoming a prevalent approach to quantify gene expression, and is expected to gain better insights to a number of biological and biomedical questions, compared to the DNA microarrays. Most importantly, RNA-Seq allows to quantify expression at the gene and alternative splicing isoform levels. However, leveraging the RNA-Seq data requires development of new data mining and analytics methods. Supervised machine learning methods are commonly used approaches for biological data analysis, and have recently gained attention for their applications to the RNA-Seq data.In this work, we assess the utility of supervised learning methods trained on RNA-Seq data for a diverse range of biological classification tasks. We hypothesize that the isoform-level expression data is more informative for biological classification tasks than the gene-level expression data. Our large-scale assessment is done through utilizing multiple datasets, organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analysis pipelines. Overall, we performed and assessed 61 biological classification problems that leverage three independent RNA-Seq datasets and include over 2,000 samples that come from multiple organisms, lab groups, and RNA-Seq analyses. These 61 problems include predictions of the tissue type, sex, or age of the sample, healthy or cancerous phenotypes and, the pathological tumor stage for the samples from the cancerous tissue. For each classification problem, the performance of three normalization techniques and six machine learning classifiers was explored. We find that for every single classification problem, the isoform-based classifiers outperform or are comparable with gene expression based methods.

To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel maximum likelihood framework for fitting Lévy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both a gradual and punctuated component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fit by punctuated processes over models of gradual change, gradual stasis, and adaptive radiation.

A popular approach for curated small-scale meta-analysis is activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which identifies brain regions consistently activated across a selected set of experiments, such as within a functional domain or mental disorder. ALE can also be utilized in meta-analytic co-activation modeling (MACM) to identify brain regions consistently co-activated with a seed region. Therefore, ALE aims to find consensus across experiments, treating heterogeneity across experiments as noise. However, heterogeneity within an ALE analysis of a functional domain might indicate the presence of functional sub-domains. Similarly, heterogeneity within a MACM analysis might indicate the involvement of a seed region in multiple co-activation patterns that are dependent on task contexts. Here, we demonstrate the use of the author-topic model to automatically determine if heterogeneities within ALE-type meta-analyses can be robustly explained by a small number of latent patterns. In the first application, the author-topic modeling of experiments involving self-generated thought (N = 179) revealed cognitive components fractionating the default network. In the second application, the author-topic model revealed that the left inferior frontal junction (IFJ) participated in multiple task-dependent co-activation patterns (N = 323). Furthermore, the author-topic model estimates compared favorably with spatial independent component analysis in both simulation and real data. Overall, the results suggest that the author-topic model is a flexible tool for exploring heterogeneity in ALE-type meta-analyses that might arise from functional sub-domains, mental disorder subtypes or task-dependent co-activation patterns.

While the ability to predict deleteriousness for any given variant is limited, missense variants remain a particularly challenging class of variation to interpret, since they can have drastically different effects depending on both the precise location and specific amino acid substitution of the variant. In order to better evaluate missense variation, we leveraged the exome sequencing data of 60,706 individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset to identify sub-genic regions that are depleted of missense variation. We further used this depletion as part of a novel missense deleteriousness metric named MPC.

Distinguishing between these possibilities has been challenging because axonal projections of only a few individual neurons have been reconstructed.

Furthermore, broadcasting cells do not project to all targets randomly, but rather comprise subpopulations that either avoid or preferentially innervate specific subsets of cortical areas. Our data argue against a model of dedicated lines of intracortical information transfer via “one neuron – one target area” mapping.

Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms.

Though powerful, these methods suffer from limited interpretability they can detect which sets of populations have evidence for polygenic adaptation, but are unable to reveal where in the history of multiple populations these processes occurred. To address this, we created a method to detect polygenic adaptation in an admixture graph, which is a representation of the historical divergences and admixture events relating different populations through time. We developed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to infer branch-specific parameters reflecting the strength of selection in each branch of a graph. Additionally, we developed a set of summary statistics that are fast to compute and can indicate which branches are most likely to have experienced polygenic adaptation. We show via simulations that this method - which we call PolyGraph - has good power to detect polygenic adaptation, and applied it to human population genomic data from around the world.

Surprisingly, brief activity selectively induces a small subset of the ARG program that that corresponds precisely to the first of three temporal waves of genes induced by sustained activity. These first-wave genes are distinguished by an open chromatin state, proximity to rapidly activated enhancers, and a requirement for MAPKERK signaling for their induction. MAPKERK mediates rapid RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters, as well as enhancer RNA induction but not histone acetylation at enhancers.

This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5 %, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.If you observe P =0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 1001 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive risk would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe P = 0.00045.It is recommended that the terms “significant” and “non-significant” should never be used. Rather, P values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed P value.Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P \u0026lt; 0.05 as “statistically significant”.

Addressing these issues eliminates the proposed 125-year upper limit to human lifespan.","tags":["biorxiv","physiology","100-200-users","2017"],"title":"The dynamic upper limit of human lifespan, bioRxiv, 2017-04-06","uri":"/reports/the_dynamic_upper_limit_of_human_lifespan_18545614/"},{"date":"2017-04-05T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractSex differences in the human brain are of interest, for example because of sex differences in the observed prevalence of psychiatric disorders and in some psychological traits.

Here we address this issue by taking advantage of a well-characterised experimental model system, in which auxotrophic genotypes of E. coli derive essential amino acid from prototrophic donor cells using intercellular nanotubes. Surprisingly, donor-recipient cocultures revealed that the mere presence of auxotrophic genotypes in coculture was sufficient to increase amino acid production levels in donor cells. Subsequent experiments unravelled that this effect was due to the depletion of amino acid concentrations in the cytoplasm of donor cells, which delayed feedback inhibition of the corresponding amino acid biosynthetic pathway. This finding indicates that in newly established mutualistic associations, an intercellular regulation of exchanged metabolites can simply emerge from the architecture of the underlying biosynthetic pathways, rather than through the evolution of new regulatory mechanisms.

Tardigrada are placed as sisters to Arthropoda and Onychophora (velvet worms) in the superphylum Ecdysozoa by morphological analyses, but many molecular phylogenies fail to recover this relationship. This tension between molecular and morphological understanding may be very revealing of the mode and patterns of evolution of major groups. Similar to bdelloid rotifers, nematodes and other animals of the water film, limno-terrestrial tardigrades display extreme cryptobiotic abilities, including anhydrobiosis and cryobiosis. These extremophile behaviors challenge understanding of normal, aqueous physiology how does a multicellular organism avoid lethal cellular collapse in the absence of liquid water? Meiofaunal species have been reported to have elevated levels of HGT events, but how important this is in evolution, and in particular in the evolution of extremophile physiology, is unclear. To address these questions, we resequenced and reassembled the genome of Hypsibius dujardini, a limno-terrestrial tardigrade that can undergo anhydrobiosis only after extensive pre-exposure to drying conditions, and compared it to the genome of Ramazzottius varieornatus, a related species with tolerance to rapid desiccation. The two species had contrasting gene expression responses to anhydrobiosis, with major transcriptional change in H. dujardini but limited regulation in R. varieornatus. We identified few horizontally transferred genes, but some of these were shown to be involved in entry into anhydrobiosis.

We find that orco mutants exhibit severe deficiencies in social behavior and fitness, suggesting that they are unable to perceive pheromones. Surprisingly, unlike in Drosophila melanogaster, orco mutant ants also lack most of the approximately 500 antennal lobe glomeruli found in wild-types.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that respondents wanted more short courses to help boost their expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation. However, it was evident that most respondents appreciated their need for training only after designing their experiments and collecting their data. This is clearly rather late in the research workflow, and suboptimal from a training perspective, as skills acquired to address a specific need at a particular time are seldom retained, engendering a cycle of low confidence in trainees. To ensure that such skill gaps do not continue to create barriers to the progress of research, we argue that universities should strive to bring their life-science curricula into the digital-data era.

Dominance hierarchies have received great attention from behavioural and evolutionary ecologists. As a result, there are many methods for inferring hierarchies from social interactions. Yet, there are no clear guidelines about how many observed dominance interactions (i.e. sampling effort) are necessary for inferring reliable dominance hierarchies, nor are there any established tools for quantifying their uncertainty. In this study, we simulated interactions (winners and losers) in scenarios of varying steepness (the probability that a dominant defeats a subordinate based on their difference in rank). Using these data, we (1) quantify how the number of interactions recorded and hierarchy steepness affect the performance of three methods, (2) propose an amendment that improves the performance of a popular method, and (3) suggest two easy procedures to measure uncertainty in the inferred hierarchy. First, we found that the ratio of interactions to individuals required to infer reliable hierarchies is surprisingly low, but depends on the hierarchy steepness and method used. We then show that David’s score and our novel randomized Elo-rating are the two best methods, whereas the original Elo-rating and the recently described ADAGIO perform less well. Finally, we propose two simple methods to estimate uncertainty at the individual and group level. These uncertainty measures further allow to differentiate non-existent, very flat and highly uncertain hierarchies from intermediate, steep and certain hierarchies. Overall, we find that the methods for inferring dominance hierarchies are relatively robust, even when the ratio of observed interactions to individuals is as low as 10 to 20.

Using ∼20 000 individuals in the Generation Scotland family cohort genotyped for ∼700 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we exploit the high levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in members of the same family to quantify the total effect of genetic variants that are not tagged in GWASs of unrelated individuals. In our models, genetic variants in low LD with genotyped SNPs explain over half of the genetic variance in intelligence, education, and neuroticism. By capturing these additional genetic effects our models closely approximate the heritability estimates from twin studies for intelligence and education, but not for neuroticism and extraversion. We then replicated our finding using imputed molecular genetic data from unrelated individuals to show that ∼50% of differences in intelligence, and ∼40% of the differences in education, can be explained by genetic effects when a larger number of rare SNPs are included.

Restoring CTCF reinstates proper architecture on altered chromosomes, indicating a powerful instructive function for CTCF in chromatin folding, and CTCF remains essential for TAD organization in non-dividing cells. Surprisingly, active and inactive genome compartments remain properly segregated upon CTCF depletion, revealing that compartmentalization of mammalian chromosomes emerges independently of proper insulation of TADs. Further, our data supports that CTCF mediates transcriptional insulator function through enhancer-blocking but not direct chromatin barrier activity. These results define the functions of CTCF in chromosome folding, and provide new fundamental insights into the rules governing mammalian genome organization.","tags":["biorxiv","genomics","200-500-users","2016"],"title":"Targeted degradation of CTCF decouples local insulation of chromosome domains from higher-order genomic compartmentalization, bioRxiv, 2016-12-22","uri":"/reports/targeted_degradation_of_ctcf_decouples_local_insulation_of_chromosome_domains_from_higher-order_genomic_compartmentalization_14915362/"},{"date":"2016-12-15T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGood scientific writing is essential to career development and to the progress of science. A well-structured manuscript allows readers and reviewers to get excited about the subject matter, to understand and verify the paper’s contributions, and to integrate these contributions into a broader context.

We found that white light guides C. elegans foraging decisions away from harmful bacteria that secrete a blue pigment toxin. Absorption of amber light by this blue pigment toxin alters the color of light sensed by the worm, and thereby triggers an increase in avoidance. By combining narrow-band blue and amber light sources, we demonstrated that detection of the specific blueamber ratio by the worm guides its foraging decision. These behavioral and psychophysical studies thus establish the existence of a color detection system that is distinct from those of other animals.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","200-500-users","2016"],"title":"C. elegans discriminate colors without eyes or opsins, bioRxiv, 2016-12-09","uri":"/reports/c._elegans_discriminate_colors_without_eyes_or_opsins_14543318/"},{"date":"2016-09-02T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractThe interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density, i.e. the selection coefficient per base pair, is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from Mimulus guttatus, we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared to what M. guttatus populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species M. nasutus has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.","tags":["biorxiv","evolutionary-biology","100-200-users","2016"],"title":"Population-genomic inference of the strength and timing of selection against gene flow, bioRxiv, 2016-09-02","uri":"/reports/population-genomic_inference_of_the_strength_and_timing_of_selection_against_gene_flow_10954230/"},{"date":"2016-08-26T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe have empirically assessed the distribution of published effect sizes and estimated power by extracting more than 100,000 statistical records from about 10,000 cognitive neuroscience and psychology papers published during the past 5 years.

For complex diseases such as cancer, characterized by high inter-patient variance, the implementation of precision medicine approaches is dependent upon understanding the pathological processes at the molecular level. While the “omics” era provides unique opportunities to dissect the molecular features of diseases, the ability to utilize it in targeted therapeutic efforts is hindered by both the massive size and diverse nature of the “omics” data. Recent advances with Deep Learning Neural Networks (DLNNs), suggests that DLNN could be trained on large data sets to efficiently predict therapeutic responses in cancer treatment. We present the application of Association Rule Mining combined with DLNNs for the analysis of high-throughput molecular profiles of 1001 cancer cell lines, in order to extract cancer-specific signatures in the form of easily interpretable rules and use these rules as input to predict pharmacological responses to a large number of anti-cancer drugs. The proposed algorithm outperformed Random Forests (RF) and Bayesian Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning (BMMKL) classification which currently represent the state-of-the-art in drug-response prediction. Moreover, the in silico pipeline presented, introduces a novel strategy for identifying potential therapeutic targets, as well as possible drug combinations with high therapeutic potential. For the first time, we demonstrate that DLNNs trained on a large pharmacogenomics data-set can effectively predict the therapeutic response of specific drugs in different cancer types. These findings serve as a proof of concept for the application of DLNNs to predict therapeutic responsiveness, a milestone in precision medicine.","tags":["biorxiv","bioinformatics","100-200-users","2016"],"title":"Deep Learning and Association Rule Mining for Predicting Drug Response in Cancer.

Elemental aspects of its organization remain elusive. Here we examine which structural traits of cortical regions, particularly their cytoarchitecture and thickness, relate to the existence and strength of inter-regional connections. We use the architecture data from the classic work of von Economo and Koskinas and state-of-the-art diffusion-based connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project. Our results reveal a prominent role of the cytoarchitectonic similarity of supragranular layers for predicting the existence and strength of connections. In contrast, cortical thickness similarity was not related to the existence or strength of connections. These results are in line with findings for non-human mammalian cerebral cortices, suggesting overarching wiring principles of the mammalian cerebral cortex. The results invite hypotheses about evolutionary conserved neurobiological mechanisms that give rise to the relation of cytoarchitecture and connectivity in the human cerebral cortex.","tags":["biorxiv","neuroscience","100-200-users","2016"],"title":"Cytoarchitectonic similarity is a wiring principle of the human connectome, bioRxiv, 2016-08-07","uri":"/reports/cytoarchitectonic_similarity_is_a_wiring_principle_of_the_human_connectome_10304139/"},{"date":"2016-07-29T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractGenetic clustering algorithms, implemented in popular programs such as STRUCTURE and ADMIXTURE, have been used extensively in the characterisation of individuals and populations based on genetic data.

Histories can also be reconstructed using the same procedure for groups which do not have admixture in their recent history, where recent genetic drift is strong or that deviate in other ways from the underlying inference model. Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading. We have implemented an approach (badMIXTURE, available at github.comdanjlawsonbadMIXTURE) to assess the goodness of fit of the model using the ancestry “palettes” estimated by CHROMOPAINTER and apply it to both simulated data and real case studies.

Application of this straightforward protocol reveals the full extent of the skew of these distributions and the variation in citations received by published papers that is characteristic of all scientific journals. Although there are differences among journals across the spectrum of JIFs, the citation distributions overlap extensively, demonstrating that the citation performance of individual papers cannot be inferred from the JIF. We propose that this methodology be adopted by all journals as a move to greater transparency, one that should help to refocus attention on individual pieces of work and counter the inappropriate usage of JIFs during the process of research assessment.","tags":["biorxiv","scientific-communication-and-education","500+-users","2016"],"title":"A simple proposal for the publication of journal citation distributions, bioRxiv, 2016-07-06","uri":"/reports/a_simple_proposal_for_the_publication_of_journal_citation_distributions_9264499/"},{"date":"2016-06-16T00:00:00Z","description":"AbstractWe show how positional markers can be used to encode genetic variation within aBurrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), and use this to construct a generalisation ofthe traditional “reference genome”, incorporating known variation within aspecies.

There is no correlation, however, between body size and cancer risk. This lack of correlation is often referred to as ‘Peto’s Paradox’. Here we show that the elephant genome encodes 20 copies of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 and that the increase in TP53 copy number occurred coincident with the evolution of large body sizes, the evolution of extreme sensitivity to genotoxic stress, and a hyperactive TP53 signaling pathway in the elephant (Proboscidean) lineage. Furthermore we show that several of the TP53 retrogenes (TP53RTGs) are transcribed and likely translated. While TP53RTGs do not appear to directly function as transcription factors, they do contribute to the enhanced sensitivity of elephant cells to DNA damage and the induction of apoptosis by regulating activity of the TP53 signaling pathway. These results suggest that an increase in the copy number of TP53 may have played a direct role in the evolution of very large body sizes and the resolution of Peto’s paradox in Proboscideans.","tags":["biorxiv","genetics","200-500-users","2015"],"title":"TP53 copy number expansion is associated with the evolution of increased body size and an enhanced DNA damage response in elephants, bioRxiv, 2015-10-07","uri":"/reports/tp53_copy_number_expansion_is_associated_with_the_evolution_of_increased_body_size_and_an_enhanced_dna_damage_response_in_elephants_4593338/"},{"date":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","description":"","tags":["nature genetics","genetics","500+-users","2015"],"title":"Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on fifty years of twin studies, Nature Genetics, 2015-05-18","uri":"/reports/meta-analysis_of_the_heritability_of_human_traits_based_on_fifty_years_of_twin_studies_4007017/"},{"date":"2013-12-04T00:00:00Z","description":"The axon initial segment of each cerebellar Purkinje cell is ensheathed by basket cell axons in a structure called the pinceau, which is largely devoid of chemical synapses and gap junctions.

Korn and Axelrad published a study in 1980 in which they reported confirmation of this conjecture. We have analysed their results and show that most are likely to be explained by an artefactual signal arising from the massive stimulation of parallel fibres they employed. We reproduce their experiments and confirm that all of their results are consistent with this artefact.
